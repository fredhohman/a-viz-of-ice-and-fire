6
00:02:05,724 --> 00:02:07,892
- Man: <i>Rider approaching!</i>
- Man ♪2: <i>Open the gate!</i>

7
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,928
( Creaking )

8
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,432
<i>( Horses neighing )</i>

9
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:39,226
- Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell.
- ( Men laugh )

10
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,663
- Envy isn't attractive.
- What envy?

11
00:02:42,698 --> 00:02:45,366
You should be proud
of your brother's achievement.

12
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,535
I took the great castle
of Winterfell with 20 men.

13
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:49,936
You're a great warrior.

14
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:52,305
I saw the bodies
above your gates.

15
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,240
Which one gave you
the tougher fight,

16
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,874
the cripple or the six-year-old?

17
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,210
( Men laugh )

18
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:00,512
I treated the Stark
boys with honor

19
00:03:00,546 --> 00:03:02,480
and they repaid me
with treachery.

20
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,650
You treated them with honor
by butchering them?

21
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,486
Before I had to kill them,
I treated them...

22
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,788
You seized their home,
as is your right.

23
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:12,558
- We're Ironborn; We take what we need.
- Exactly.

24
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:15,594
Then you made them prisoners in
their home and they ran away.

25
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,997
Is that treachery?

26
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:20,133
I'd call it bravery.

27
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,668
They made me a promise...

28
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,637
Your little boy prisoners
made you a promise

29
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:26,106
and you got mad
when they broke it?

30
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,840
Are you the dumbest cunt alive?

31
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,876
- Don't call me a...
- A cunt.

32
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,079
A dumb cunt who killed
the only two Starks in Winterfell.

33
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,381
You know how valuable
those boys were?

34
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:39,050
If I hadn't killed them, the
Northerners would think me weak.

35
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:42,220
You are weak. And you're stupid.

36
00:03:42,254 --> 00:03:44,656
I'm warning you.

37
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,424
Go on, then,

38
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,259
warn me.

39
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:53,832
You haven't brought enough men.

40
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:56,267
How am I supposed to defend
Winterfell with just this lot?

41
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:59,370
You're not. I've come to bring
you home.

42
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,905
- Father wants a word.
- Is this a joke?

43
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,607
Winterfell is the heart
of the North.

44
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:07,544
Aye, it is, hundreds of miles
from the sea.

45
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:09,179
We're islanders, baby brother.

46
00:04:09,214 --> 00:04:10,747
<i>Had you forgotten that?</i>

47
00:04:10,782 --> 00:04:13,483
<i>Our power comes from our ships.</i>

48
00:04:13,517 --> 00:04:15,585
<i>And now that you've
decorated your walls</i>

49
00:04:15,619 --> 00:04:17,320
<i>with the bodies
of the Stark boys,</i>

50
00:04:17,354 --> 00:04:21,223
every man in the North
wants to see you hanged.

51
00:04:21,257 --> 00:04:23,592
When Robb Stark finds out...

52
00:04:23,626 --> 00:04:25,527
He won't find out.
We've killed all the ravens.

53
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:28,564
We have all the horses.

54
00:04:28,598 --> 00:04:31,534
I've taken Winterfell.

55
00:04:31,568 --> 00:04:35,338
And I will keep Winterfell.

56
00:04:37,442 --> 00:04:38,876
Leave us.

57
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,525
Theon, you're my blood.

58
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,363
We both loved our mother.

59
00:04:58,397 --> 00:05:01,533
We both endured our father.

60
00:05:03,201 --> 00:05:05,536
Come home with me.
Don't die here alone.

61
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,771
I don't intend to die.

62
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,346
You were a terrible baby,
do you know that?

63
00:05:16,782 --> 00:05:19,717
Bawling all the time,
never sleeping.

64
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:23,821
And one night you just
wouldn't shut up,

65
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:27,526
screaming like a dying pig.

66
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,230
I walked over to your crib,
I looked down at you.

67
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,534
I wanted to strangle you.

68
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:37,671
And you looked up at me
and you stopped screaming.

69
00:05:39,074 --> 00:05:41,442
You smiled at me.

70
00:05:45,714 --> 00:05:48,082
Don't die so far from the sea.

71
00:06:02,831 --> 00:06:06,900
I've brought you
a present, Lord of Bones.

72
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:10,102
I already got one crow.
Don't need two.

73
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,304
Mance will want
to question this one.

74
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:15,207
<i>Knows all about where the crows
are and what they're planning.</i>

75
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:18,777
The Halfhand knows more.
This one is just a little boy.

76
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,078
Gut him.

77
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:22,881
He could have killed me
half a dozen times.

78
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:25,683
And now he wishes he did.
Gut him.

79
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:29,988
He's a bastard of Winterfell,
Ned Stark's son.

80
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,527
Mance will want him.

81
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,596
What does Mance want
with a dead man's bastard?

82
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,365
I don't know.

83
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,268
I think he'll want
to decide for himself.

84
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,945
He runs, I'll chop
his balls off.

85
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,815
He runs, I'll do it meself.

86
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:05,258
We're even now, Jon Snow.

87
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,006
I couldn't do it.

88
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,880
I had the sword at her neck,
I just couldn't...

89
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:26,044
- I know.
- The others?

90
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:29,014
When you didn't come back,
we went looking for you.

91
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,450
We found your tracks
fast enough.

92
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:34,620
But they found us
before we found you.

93
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,190
They died because of me.

94
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:40,393
See that it wasn't for nothing.

95
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:41,895
All right, up, lad.

96
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:43,764
Come on, on your feet, now.

97
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:45,565
Move it.

98
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:48,902
<i>( Birds calling,
water burbling )</i>

99
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:54,140
Is she beautiful?

100
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,341
I've never met her.

101
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,076
What's her name?

102
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,845
Frey, I suppose.

103
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,546
I don't know her first name.

104
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,984
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

105
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,454
( Both laugh )

106
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,556
And you're marrying
her for a bridge?

107
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:13,827
- An important bridge.
- Ah.

108
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:16,030
It was before
they killed my father.

109
00:08:16,064 --> 00:08:20,101
I still thought I could march south
and rescue him in time,

110
00:08:20,136 --> 00:08:22,370
but only if I crossed
that bridge.

111
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:26,975
When I speak to people
from the North,

112
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,444
they all loved your father.

113
00:08:30,547 --> 00:08:32,981
He was the best man I ever met.

114
00:08:33,015 --> 00:08:35,917
I know children always think
that about their fathers, but...

115
00:08:35,952 --> 00:08:38,687
Children do not always think that
about their fathers,

116
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:40,389
believe me.

117
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:45,294
He once told me that being
a Lord is like being a father,

118
00:08:45,328 --> 00:08:47,663
except you have
thousands of children

119
00:08:47,697 --> 00:08:49,999
and you worry about all of them.

120
00:08:50,034 --> 00:08:52,968
The farmers plowing
the fields are yours to protect.

121
00:08:53,003 --> 00:08:56,305
The charwomen scrubbing the floors,
yours to protect.

122
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,076
The soldiers
you order into battle.

123
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,312
He told me he woke
with fear in the morning

124
00:09:02,346 --> 00:09:04,614
and went to bed
with fear in the night.

125
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:09,419
I didn't believe him.

126
00:09:09,453 --> 00:09:11,621
I asked him,

127
00:09:11,655 --> 00:09:14,890
"how can a man be brave
if he's afraid?"

128
00:09:14,925 --> 00:09:18,461
"That is the only time
a man can be brave," he told me.

129
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:24,733
I wish I could have met him.

130
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:27,135
He would have liked you.

131
00:09:29,472 --> 00:09:31,573
Most Lords worry more
about their gold

132
00:09:31,608 --> 00:09:33,942
and their glory than the charwomen
scrubbing their floors.

133
00:09:33,977 --> 00:09:36,167
He didn't care much
about gold or glory.

134
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:37,712
And you?

135
00:09:37,713 --> 00:09:40,949
You think I'm fighting this war so
they'll sing songs about me?

136
00:09:42,585 --> 00:09:44,252
I want to go home.

137
00:09:44,286 --> 00:09:46,954
I want the men
following me to go home.

138
00:09:46,989 --> 00:09:48,522
Then why don't you?

139
00:09:48,557 --> 00:09:52,192
Because we'll never be safe until
the Lannisters are defeated.

140
00:09:52,227 --> 00:09:54,427
And because I believe
in justice.

141
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,730
Chopping off
Joffrey's head, you mean.

142
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:58,097
That would be a start.

143
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:01,000
<i>( Horse neighs,
hoofbeats approaching )</i>

144
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:10,176
Your Grace, Milady.

145
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:13,247
The Kingslayer,
he escaped in the night.

146
00:10:13,281 --> 00:10:14,749
How?

147
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:19,154
How?!

148
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:24,827
Tell me this isn't true.

149
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:31,000
Why?

150
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:34,804
- For the girls.
- You betrayed me.

151
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:36,773
- Robb...
- No!

152
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:38,474
You knew I would not allow it

153
00:10:38,508 --> 00:10:40,843
and you did it anyway.

154
00:10:40,877 --> 00:10:44,547
Bran and Rickon
are captives in Winterfell.

155
00:10:44,581 --> 00:10:47,884
Sansa and Arya are captives
in King's Landing.

156
00:10:47,918 --> 00:10:50,687
I have five children,
and only one of them is free.

157
00:10:50,721 --> 00:10:54,424
I lost one son fighting
by your son's side.

158
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,426
I lost another
to the Kingslayer,

159
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,528
strangled with a chain.

160
00:10:58,562 --> 00:11:00,797
You commit treason

161
00:11:00,832 --> 00:11:03,167
<i>because your children
are prisoners?</i>

162
00:11:03,201 --> 00:11:06,003
<i>I would carve out my heart</i>

163
00:11:06,037 --> 00:11:08,672
and offer it to the father
if he would let my sons

164
00:11:08,707 --> 00:11:12,075
wake from their graves
and step into a prison cell.

165
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,810
I grieve for your sons, My Lord.

166
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:16,480
I don't want your grief.
I want my vengeance.

167
00:11:16,514 --> 00:11:19,249
And you stole it from me.

168
00:11:20,652 --> 00:11:22,019
Killing Jaime Lannister

169
00:11:22,053 --> 00:11:24,221
would not buy life
for your children,

170
00:11:24,255 --> 00:11:26,089
but returning him
to King's Landing

171
00:11:26,124 --> 00:11:28,992
may buy life for mine.

172
00:11:29,027 --> 00:11:32,530
Jaime Lannister has played
you for a fool.

173
00:11:32,564 --> 00:11:34,799
You've weakened our position.

174
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,468
You've brought discord
into our camp.

175
00:11:37,502 --> 00:11:40,138
And you did it all
behind my back.

176
00:11:43,275 --> 00:11:45,443
Make sure she's guarded
day and night.

177
00:11:45,477 --> 00:11:46,203
Robb.

178
00:11:46,228 --> 00:11:48,348
How many men did we send
in pursuit of the Kingslayer?

179
00:11:48,414 --> 00:11:49,648
40, Your Grace.

180
00:11:49,682 --> 00:11:52,918
Send another 40
with our fastest horses.

181
00:11:52,953 --> 00:11:54,587
Robb.

182
00:12:02,663 --> 00:12:05,098
( Neighing )

183
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:09,035
Whoa, oof!

184
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:11,937
( Groans )

185
00:12:11,972 --> 00:12:13,973
Damn.

186
00:12:16,676 --> 00:12:19,144
You're much uglier in daylight.

187
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:21,613
What's your name?

188
00:12:21,648 --> 00:12:24,616
I'm Jaime Lannister
of Casterly Rock,

189
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,552
son of Tywin.

190
00:12:27,587 --> 00:12:31,422
A captive Knight has a right
to know his captor's identity.

191
00:12:31,457 --> 00:12:33,057
Brienne of Tarth.

192
00:12:33,092 --> 00:12:34,725
Tarth, Tarth, Tarth.

193
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,961
Crescent moons and starbursts.

194
00:12:37,996 --> 00:12:41,764
Lord... Selwyn Tarth,

195
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:44,200
your father.

196
00:12:44,235 --> 00:12:47,403
Do you have any brothers
and sisters, My Lady?

197
00:12:47,438 --> 00:12:50,106
It's a long way
to King's Landing.

198
00:12:50,141 --> 00:12:52,275
Might as well get
to know one another.

199
00:12:53,444 --> 00:12:55,012
Have you known many men?

200
00:12:55,046 --> 00:12:56,480
I suppose not.

201
00:12:56,514 --> 00:12:58,115
Women?

202
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:00,684
Horses? Ah!

203
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:02,653
I didn't mean to give
offense, My Lady.

204
00:13:02,687 --> 00:13:03,743
Forgive me.

205
00:13:03,768 --> 00:13:05,794
Your crimes are past
forgiveness, Kingslayer.

206
00:13:06,224 --> 00:13:07,825
Why do you hate me so much?

207
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:10,427
<i>- Have I ever harmed you?
- You've harmed others...</i>

208
00:13:10,461 --> 00:13:12,996
<i>Those you were sworn to protect,</i>

209
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,065
the weak, the innocent.

210
00:13:15,099 --> 00:13:18,268
Has anyone ever told you you're
as boring as you are ugly?

211
00:13:18,302 --> 00:13:20,804
You will not
provoke me to anger.

212
00:13:20,838 --> 00:13:23,340
I already have. Look at you.

213
00:13:23,374 --> 00:13:25,141
You're ready
to chop my head off.

214
00:13:25,176 --> 00:13:27,944
Do you think you could?

215
00:13:27,979 --> 00:13:29,979
Do you think you could
beat me in a fair fight?

216
00:13:30,014 --> 00:13:31,714
I've never seen you fight.

217
00:13:31,748 --> 00:13:33,750
The answer is no.

218
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:36,096
There are three men
in the kingdoms who might

219
00:13:36,121 --> 00:13:37,286
have a chance against me.

220
00:13:37,287 --> 00:13:38,788
You're not one of them.

221
00:13:38,823 --> 00:13:41,925
All my life men like you
have sneered at me.

222
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:45,195
And all my life I've been knocking
men like you into the dust.

223
00:13:45,229 --> 00:13:47,664
If you're so confident,
unlock my chains.

224
00:13:47,698 --> 00:13:49,433
Let's see what happens.

225
00:13:49,468 --> 00:13:52,536
Do you take me for an idiot? In.

226
00:13:54,807 --> 00:13:57,675
I took you for a fighter,

227
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,612
a man... pardon...
Woman of honor.

228
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:04,115
Was I wrong?

229
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:05,883
You're afraid.

230
00:14:07,452 --> 00:14:10,922
Maybe one day
we'll find out, Kingslayer.

231
00:14:24,068 --> 00:14:26,102
Kevan: <i>King's Landing
will fall an hour</i>

232
00:14:26,137 --> 00:14:29,239
<i>after Stannis lands his force.</i>

233
00:14:29,273 --> 00:14:31,574
<i>It's not too late for
King Joffrey and Cersei</i>

234
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:34,944
<i>and the court
to ride west to safety.</i>

235
00:14:34,979 --> 00:14:37,080
Surrender the Iron Throne?

236
00:14:37,114 --> 00:14:40,117
Better than seeing their heads
mounted on the city gates.

237
00:14:40,151 --> 00:14:42,752
Stannis will execute them all.

238
00:14:42,787 --> 00:14:45,922
No, a king who runs
will not be king for long.

239
00:14:45,957 --> 00:14:48,725
He's a Lannister.
He'll stand and fight.

240
00:14:50,327 --> 00:14:52,828
Stannis, two days
from the capital

241
00:14:52,862 --> 00:14:54,596
and the wolf at my doorstep.

242
00:14:54,631 --> 00:14:57,666
The scouts assure us Robb Stark
remains north of Ashemark.

243
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,568
Ha! The last time
the scouts assured us

244
00:15:00,602 --> 00:15:03,304
of Stark's movement,
he lured us into a trap.

245
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:07,575
<i>Which is why my son
is his prisoner.</i>

246
00:15:11,081 --> 00:15:13,349
<i>Too close to Casterly Rock.</i>

247
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,920
He sent a splinter force

248
00:15:16,954 --> 00:15:18,555
to recapture Winterfell.

249
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:20,791
The Greyjoys have
done us a great favor.

250
00:15:20,825 --> 00:15:24,028
Stark won't risk marching
on Casterly Rock

251
00:15:24,062 --> 00:15:25,629
until he's at full force.

252
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:29,366
He's a boy and he's
never lost a battle.

253
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,701
He'll risk anything at any time

254
00:15:31,735 --> 00:15:35,371
<i>because he doesn't know
enough to be afraid.</i>

255
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:44,779
We'll ride at nightfall.

256
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:48,049
<i>I want a full night's march before
he knows we're on the move.</i>

257
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:51,619
Clegane, you'll maintain
a garrison here at Harrenhal.

258
00:15:51,653 --> 00:15:55,156
Track down this brotherhood
and destroy them.

259
00:15:57,425 --> 00:16:00,227
The girl has proven
herself a good servant.

260
00:16:00,262 --> 00:16:02,663
<i>She'll stay on with you.</i>

261
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:04,932
<i>See that he doesn't get
drunk in the evenings.</i>

262
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:07,735
He's poor company
when he's sober,

263
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:10,438
but he's better at his work.

264
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:19,813
You've got some
questions to answer.

265
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:21,881
Man: <i>Who killed Ser Amory?</i>

266
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,583
- Man ♪2: I don't know!
- <i>Give me the name.</i>

267
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:25,918
- Man ♪2: Please!
- Man ♪3: <i>Take this one out for the crows.</i>

268
00:16:25,953 --> 00:16:29,289
Man ♪2:
<i>I told you, I don't know.</i>

269
00:16:29,324 --> 00:16:31,425
<i>Please.</i>

270
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:34,194
Look, it's Yoren's little cunt.

271
00:16:34,229 --> 00:16:35,963
Used to be a boy,
now it's a girl.

272
00:16:35,997 --> 00:16:38,900
- ( Man laughs )
- Where's Jaqen?

273
00:16:38,934 --> 00:16:40,569
Don't care.

274
00:16:40,603 --> 00:16:43,705
Where's your stick now, bitch?

275
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:45,206
I promised to fuck you with it.

276
00:16:45,241 --> 00:16:48,309
Guard: <i>Come on, time to kill
some wolves.</i>

277
00:16:48,344 --> 00:16:51,512
<i>( Men shouting )</i>

278
00:16:57,219 --> 00:16:59,453
You need sour cherries
to make it right.

279
00:16:59,487 --> 00:17:01,604
<i>And the secret is you dry
the stones, and then you</i>

280
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:02,689
<i>break them with a mallet.</i>

281
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,491
<i>That's where the real flavor is.</i>

282
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,159
<i>You crush 'em up real fine.</i>

283
00:17:06,194 --> 00:17:08,396
And then when you're finished,
you sprinkle them over the piecrust.

284
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,265
- Where's Jaqen?
- How would I know?

285
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:12,100
I need him now.

286
00:17:12,135 --> 00:17:13,835
Lord Tywin's marching tonight.

287
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,571
- You need him?
- He's helping me.

288
00:17:16,606 --> 00:17:19,074
- Hot Pie: I saw him.
- Where?

289
00:17:21,544 --> 00:17:23,078
- Where?!
- Ow!

290
00:17:23,113 --> 00:17:23,876
Where?

291
00:17:23,901 --> 00:17:25,548
They went riding out
the gates a few hours ago.

292
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:29,685
On patrol. Let go of my ears.

293
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:31,187
<i>( Horses neighing,
men shouting )</i>

294
00:17:34,225 --> 00:17:36,459
What do you want
with him anyway?

295
00:17:36,494 --> 00:17:38,594
<i>( Men shouting )</i>

296
00:17:48,005 --> 00:17:50,106
( Wind howling )

297
00:17:51,575 --> 00:17:54,144
Qhorin: Mance is gonna
march on the Wall.

298
00:17:54,178 --> 00:17:56,546
When he does, one brother
inside his army

299
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:58,382
will be worth 1,000
fighting against it.

300
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,585
- They'll never trust me.
- They might...

301
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:02,554
- If you do what needs to be done.
- What?

302
00:18:02,588 --> 00:18:05,124
How does it feel knowing
those men all died

303
00:18:05,158 --> 00:18:08,211
so you could skip through the
snow with your little savage girl?

304
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:08,813
I didn't.

305
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,918
I should have known better,
trusting a traitor's bastard.

306
00:18:15,902 --> 00:18:19,438
He's not yours to kill, crow.

307
00:18:41,963 --> 00:18:43,597
Do you have to do that here?

308
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:48,268
I like to keep me hands clean.

309
00:18:48,302 --> 00:18:50,904
Yes, but do you
have to do it here?

310
00:19:00,114 --> 00:19:01,714
You should start wearing
the gold cloak.

311
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:03,383
I don't want to wear
a gold cloak.

312
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:05,885
<i>You're commander
of the City Watch.</i>

313
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,320
You shouldn't be dressed
like a common sellsword.

314
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,055
A cloak slows you down
in a fight,

315
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:11,124
makes it hard to move quietly.

316
00:19:11,158 --> 00:19:12,792
And the gold catches the light,

317
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:14,961
so you're nice and easy
to spot at night.

318
00:19:14,995 --> 00:19:17,831
Well, you're not sneaking
through alleyways any longer.

319
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,732
You're supposed to stand out.

320
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:22,869
We had a deal, and wearing
a gold cloak wasn't part of it.

321
00:19:22,904 --> 00:19:24,805
Fine, fine.

322
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:28,576
No gold cloak.

323
00:19:35,618 --> 00:19:37,986
- What?
- What?

324
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:40,322
What? What?
Why are you staring at me?

325
00:19:40,357 --> 00:19:43,359
( Scoffs ) You don't want me
cleaning me nails.

326
00:19:43,394 --> 00:19:44,794
You don't want me
looking your way.

327
00:19:44,828 --> 00:19:46,696
Why am I here?

328
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,395
To help me plan the defense
of King's Landing.

329
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,400
( Laughs )

330
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:52,135
Stannis will be here any day.

331
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:55,305
( Sighs )

332
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:58,074
And one of these
explains how to beat him?

333
00:19:59,544 --> 00:20:02,279
"An History of the Great
Sieges of Westeros"

334
00:20:02,313 --> 00:20:05,282
by Archmaester "Shevelathin."

335
00:20:05,316 --> 00:20:07,284
"Shevelatesh."

336
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:09,453
"Chevalteesh."

337
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,026
I'd swap all your books
for a few good archers.

338
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,395
My Lord Hand, Commander.

339
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:18,896
I must compliment you

340
00:20:18,931 --> 00:20:22,166
on the Gold Cloaks' performance
these last few weeks.

341
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,204
Did you know there has been
a marked drop in thievery?

342
00:20:27,306 --> 00:20:30,041
I did not know.

343
00:20:30,076 --> 00:20:33,345
And how did you accomplish
this marked drop in thievery?

344
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,814
Me and the lads rounded up
all the known thieves.

345
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:38,450
For questioning?

346
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:41,086
<i>Uh, no.</i>

347
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,421
It's just the unknown thieves
we need to worry about now.

348
00:20:43,456 --> 00:20:46,491
- We talked about this.
- Aye, we talked about it.

349
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:49,527
Have you ever been
in a city under siege?

350
00:20:49,561 --> 00:20:51,996
Maybe this part's
not in your books.

351
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:54,432
See, it's not the fighting
that kills most people.

352
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:57,669
It's the starving.
Food's worth more than gold.

353
00:20:57,703 --> 00:21:01,306
Noble ladies sell their diamonds
for a sack of potatoes.

354
00:21:01,373 --> 00:21:03,207
Things get bad enough,

355
00:21:03,242 --> 00:21:05,076
the poor start
eating each other.

356
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:08,012
<i>The thieves, they love a siege.</i>

357
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:11,149
Soon as the gates are sealed,
they steal all the food.

358
00:21:11,183 --> 00:21:14,186
By the time it's all over,
they're the richest men in town.

359
00:21:15,922 --> 00:21:17,590
Given the circumstances,
My Lord,

360
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:21,127
I believe extreme measures
are warranted.

361
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:23,029
Ah.

362
00:21:23,063 --> 00:21:26,065
"The Great Sieges of Westeros."

363
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:28,133
Thrilling subject.

364
00:21:28,168 --> 00:21:32,937
Shame Archmaester Ch'vyalthan
wasn't a better writer.

365
00:21:36,642 --> 00:21:39,910
Stannis knows King's Landing.

366
00:21:39,944 --> 00:21:42,546
He knows where the walls
are strongest

367
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:46,316
and he knows which gates
are weakest.

368
00:21:48,786 --> 00:21:50,787
The mud gate.

369
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,791
A good ram will batter it
down in minutes

370
00:21:53,825 --> 00:21:56,526
<i>and it's only 50 yards
from the water.</i>

371
00:21:56,561 --> 00:21:58,095
That's where he'll land.

372
00:21:58,129 --> 00:22:00,998
And if Stannis does
attack the mud gate,

373
00:22:01,032 --> 00:22:03,300
what is our plan?

374
00:22:03,334 --> 00:22:05,335
We could throw books at his men.

375
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:06,904
We don't have that many books.

376
00:22:06,938 --> 00:22:08,772
We don't have
that many men, either.

377
00:22:09,707 --> 00:22:11,975
What do we have?

378
00:22:12,977 --> 00:22:15,111
Pig shit.

379
00:22:16,581 --> 00:22:18,849
( Wind howling )

380
00:22:18,883 --> 00:22:21,084
( Chatter )

381
00:22:27,558 --> 00:22:30,626
( Panting )

382
00:22:32,729 --> 00:22:35,263
I'm not cut out
for this sort of work.

383
00:22:35,298 --> 00:22:38,766
I always imagined meself
doing something much worse.

384
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:41,602
We're digging latrine pits
at the end of the world.

385
00:22:41,637 --> 00:22:44,272
I can't imagine
anything much worse.

386
00:22:44,306 --> 00:22:47,875
Dolorous Edd:
<i>You lack imagination.</i>

387
00:22:49,211 --> 00:22:51,346
Sam: <i>Where do you think
Jon is right now?</i>

388
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,316
He went off with the Halfhand.
He didn't come back.

389
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,585
A betting man
would go with dead.

390
00:22:57,654 --> 00:22:59,422
He's not dead.

391
00:22:59,456 --> 00:23:01,624
No, Jon's a great fighter.

392
00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:03,593
Well, he's better than me

393
00:23:03,628 --> 00:23:05,596
and a lot better than you.

394
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,532
He's got a Valyrian steel sword.

395
00:23:08,566 --> 00:23:10,467
So did his father.

396
00:23:10,501 --> 00:23:13,270
And Qhorin Halfhand
is the greatest ranger alive.

397
00:23:13,304 --> 00:23:16,005
Great rangers never
get old is the problem.

398
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,608
Shit ones neither.

399
00:23:18,643 --> 00:23:21,745
It's them in the middle
that last a long time.

400
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,080
( Clangs )

401
00:23:27,116 --> 00:23:29,618
What in seven hells is that?

402
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,401
The First Men made these marks.

403
00:23:47,435 --> 00:23:50,070
Help me with it.

404
00:23:53,675 --> 00:23:56,077
( Straining )

405
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,984
Look.

406
00:24:08,022 --> 00:24:10,557
If you find something
you're not supposed to,

407
00:24:10,592 --> 00:24:13,661
best thing to do is pretend
you've never seen it.

408
00:24:13,695 --> 00:24:15,396
That's a Night's Watch cloak.

409
00:24:15,431 --> 00:24:17,933
It's been here a long time.

410
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:25,874
Oh, must be Dragonglass.

411
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:27,942
Grenn: <i>Dragonglass?</i>

412
00:24:27,977 --> 00:24:30,812
The Maesters call it Obsidian.

413
00:24:32,247 --> 00:24:33,747
Why would a brother
hide it here?

414
00:24:33,782 --> 00:24:37,317
I expect it's 'cause
he wanted somebody to find it.

415
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,424
Mind where you're going.

416
00:24:53,636 --> 00:24:55,971
I'm sorry. I'll...

417
00:24:57,106 --> 00:24:59,775
- Where were you?
- A man has patrol duty.

418
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,411
Tywin Lannister was right here

419
00:25:01,445 --> 00:25:02,746
and now he's gone.

420
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,581
A girl owes one more name.

421
00:25:04,615 --> 00:25:06,982
The Red God demands it.
Give the man a name.

422
00:25:08,284 --> 00:25:09,985
How long after
I give you the name

423
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:12,020
does it take you
to kill someone?

424
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:15,689
A minute, an hour, a month.

425
00:25:16,858 --> 00:25:21,028
Death is certain,
the time is not.

426
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:23,196
He's taking his army
to attack my brother.

427
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,132
I need him dead right now.

428
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:28,435
This a man cannot do.

429
00:25:28,469 --> 00:25:30,938
You promised you'd help me.

430
00:25:30,972 --> 00:25:32,973
Help was not promised,
lovely girl.

431
00:25:33,008 --> 00:25:35,810
Only death.
There must be others.

432
00:25:35,844 --> 00:25:38,179
Give a name, any name.

433
00:25:38,214 --> 00:25:40,315
And you'll kill them?

434
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:42,284
Anybody?

435
00:25:45,054 --> 00:25:48,323
By the seven New Gods
and the Old Gods beyond counting,

436
00:25:48,357 --> 00:25:50,225
I swear it.

437
00:25:52,795 --> 00:25:54,896
All right.

438
00:25:59,801 --> 00:26:01,801
Jaqen H'ghar.

439
00:26:08,175 --> 00:26:10,243
A girl gives a man his own name?

440
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,912
- That's right.
- <i>Gods are not mocked.</i>

441
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,482
- This is no joking thing.
- I'm not joking.

442
00:26:15,516 --> 00:26:17,083
A man can go kill himself.

443
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,118
- Un-name me.
- No.

444
00:26:19,153 --> 00:26:21,287
Please?

445
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,124
I'll un-name you.

446
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:26,157
Thank you.

447
00:26:26,182 --> 00:26:27,911
If you help me
and my friends escape.

448
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,531
<i>This would require
more than one life.</i>

449
00:26:31,565 --> 00:26:34,768
- <i>This is not part of our bargain.</i>
- Fine, Jaqen H'ghar.

450
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:36,904
A girl lacks honor.

451
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:47,748
If I do this thing,
a girl must obey.

452
00:26:47,783 --> 00:26:49,851
A girl will obey.

453
00:26:51,453 --> 00:26:54,755
A girl and her friends will walk
through the gate at midnight.

454
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,994
Thank you, Podrick.

455
00:27:08,403 --> 00:27:10,270
Odd little boy.

456
00:27:10,304 --> 00:27:12,505
I have a certain sympathy
for odd little boys.

457
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,108
You and Varys both.

458
00:27:16,744 --> 00:27:18,979
Excellent lamprey pie.

459
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:21,715
Were you slaving away
in the kitchen all day?

460
00:27:22,817 --> 00:27:24,485
I hear Joffrey
plans on fighting.

461
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,988
An inspiration for the troops.

462
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:28,657
The young king
in his shining armor

463
00:27:28,691 --> 00:27:31,492
fighting to defend the capital
against the wicked old rebel.

464
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:33,328
He's only a boy.

465
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:35,897
Younger boys are off
fighting his war.

466
00:27:35,932 --> 00:27:37,733
He's not ready.

467
00:27:37,767 --> 00:27:40,002
What is he, 17?

468
00:27:40,037 --> 00:27:42,838
- Remember Jaime at 17?
- Better than you.

469
00:27:42,873 --> 00:27:45,675
Some men have a gift
for this sort of thing,

470
00:27:45,709 --> 00:27:47,577
some don't.

471
00:27:47,611 --> 00:27:49,478
His place is not
on the battlefield.

472
00:27:49,513 --> 00:27:51,747
It's not on the throne, either,

473
00:27:51,781 --> 00:27:54,215
sadly for all of us.

474
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:59,454
Do you think I'm an idiot?

475
00:27:59,488 --> 00:28:01,289
No, I'd say you possess
above average intelligence.

476
00:28:01,324 --> 00:28:03,458
You shipped off
my only daughter.

477
00:28:03,492 --> 00:28:06,794
And now you want to send my
eldest son to the battlefield to die.

478
00:28:06,829 --> 00:28:08,997
He'll have his Kingsguard
protecting him.

479
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:11,966
He has the finest armor
gold can buy.

480
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:13,868
He needs to be out there.

481
00:28:13,903 --> 00:28:15,983
The men will fight more
fiercely seeing their king

482
00:28:16,008 --> 00:28:16,938
fighting beside them

483
00:28:16,939 --> 00:28:20,609
instead of hiding behind
his mother's skirts.

484
00:28:20,643 --> 00:28:23,078
Any dessert?

485
00:28:23,112 --> 00:28:26,015
Do you know why
Varys is so dangerous?

486
00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:29,085
Because he has thousands
of spies in his employ.

487
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:32,422
Because he knows everything
we do before we do it.

488
00:28:32,456 --> 00:28:34,024
Because he doesn't have a cock.

489
00:28:34,058 --> 00:28:36,493
Neither do you.

490
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:40,297
Perhaps I'm dangerous, too.

491
00:28:40,331 --> 00:28:42,132
You, on the other hand,

492
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:44,635
are as big a fool
as every other man.

493
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:47,004
That little worm
between your legs

494
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,539
does half your thinking.

495
00:28:48,573 --> 00:28:51,441
- It's not that little.
- ( Laughs )

496
00:28:56,914 --> 00:28:58,481
Why are you smiling?

497
00:28:58,515 --> 00:29:01,050
Because I'm happy.

498
00:29:01,084 --> 00:29:02,818
And why are you happy?

499
00:29:06,456 --> 00:29:09,526
Because I have
your little whore.

500
00:29:12,263 --> 00:29:14,732
I thought you preferred blondes.

501
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:16,133
Such a droll little fellow.

502
00:29:16,168 --> 00:29:18,002
Tell me, have you
married this one yet?

503
00:29:18,037 --> 00:29:20,271
No?

504
00:29:20,306 --> 00:29:23,242
Oh, good.
Father will be so pleased.

505
00:29:23,276 --> 00:29:24,911
Why do you care who I fuck?

506
00:29:24,945 --> 00:29:27,613
Because a Lannister
always pays her debts.

507
00:29:27,648 --> 00:29:29,248
You stole my only daughter,

508
00:29:29,283 --> 00:29:30,883
you plot to have Joffrey killed.

509
00:29:30,917 --> 00:29:33,820
This is madness.
Stannis will be here in days.

510
00:29:33,854 --> 00:29:35,421
- You need me.
- For what?

511
00:29:35,456 --> 00:29:37,557
Your skill in battle?

512
00:29:39,193 --> 00:29:41,527
Pretty thing, your whore.

513
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:44,063
Lovely body.

514
00:29:44,098 --> 00:29:46,666
The bruises will heal in time.

515
00:29:48,102 --> 00:29:49,769
Where did you find her?

516
00:29:49,804 --> 00:29:52,039
Varys isn't the only one
who hears whispers.

517
00:29:52,073 --> 00:29:55,542
Really, a Lannister
lion necklace?

518
00:29:55,577 --> 00:29:58,679
You need to hide your secret whores
more carefully.

519
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:01,549
You've forgotten the most
important thing about whores.

520
00:30:01,583 --> 00:30:03,418
Oh?

521
00:30:03,452 --> 00:30:05,053
Well, you're the expert.

522
00:30:05,087 --> 00:30:07,255
Tell me.

523
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:10,758
You don't buy them;
You only rent them.

524
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:15,329
You're usually a better liar,
baby brother.

525
00:30:15,363 --> 00:30:17,297
This one you like.

526
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,834
You like her very much.

527
00:30:20,868 --> 00:30:22,936
Could it be love?

528
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:26,573
Don't worry, she'll be treated
gently enough...

529
00:30:26,641 --> 00:30:28,308
unless Joffrey is hurt.

530
00:30:28,342 --> 00:30:31,912
And then every wound
he suffers she'll suffer, too.

531
00:30:31,947 --> 00:30:34,315
And if he dies,

532
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:36,316
there isn't a man alive
who could devise

533
00:30:36,351 --> 00:30:39,520
a more painful death
for your little cunt.

534
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:45,794
And how do I know you
haven't killed her already?

535
00:30:45,828 --> 00:30:47,329
Would you like to see her?

536
00:30:47,363 --> 00:30:48,964
I thought you might.

537
00:30:48,998 --> 00:30:51,734
Ser Mandon, bring in
my brother's whore.

538
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:26,268
I'm sorry they hurt you.

539
00:31:27,671 --> 00:31:30,172
You must be brave.

540
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:37,445
I promise I will free you.

541
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,580
Don't forget me.

542
00:31:40,615 --> 00:31:42,916
Never.

543
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:53,761
<i>( Door opens, closes )</i>

544
00:32:00,704 --> 00:32:03,405
I will hurt you for this.

545
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,043
A day will come when you
think you're safe and happy

546
00:32:07,077 --> 00:32:11,180
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth.

547
00:32:12,249 --> 00:32:13,883
And you will know
the debt is paid.

548
00:32:13,917 --> 00:32:17,053
Get out.

549
00:32:28,431 --> 00:32:30,532
Shae!

550
00:32:32,936 --> 00:32:35,236
I've been waiting all night.

551
00:32:35,271 --> 00:32:36,971
What is wrong?

552
00:32:37,006 --> 00:32:39,140
You're beautiful.

553
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:49,484
Then why do you look sad?

554
00:32:55,926 --> 00:32:57,826
We have to be more careful.

555
00:32:57,861 --> 00:33:00,896
Don't be afraid.
I can take care of myself.

556
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:03,999
There are people
who want to hurt me.

557
00:33:04,034 --> 00:33:06,502
I know. I won't let them.

558
00:33:06,536 --> 00:33:09,705
I'll cut off their faces.
I will.

559
00:33:13,777 --> 00:33:17,646
I would kill for you.
Do you know that?

560
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,416
I expect I'll have to
before this is over.

561
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,721
You're mine.

562
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,891
I'm yours.

563
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:31,260
Promise me.

564
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:38,434
I'm yours, and you are mine.

565
00:33:49,579 --> 00:33:51,480
Robb: <i>Still no word?</i>

566
00:33:51,514 --> 00:33:54,082
We've sent a dozen ravens.

567
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:56,551
None have returned.

568
00:33:56,585 --> 00:33:59,954
My bastard is only
a few days from Winterfell.

569
00:33:59,988 --> 00:34:01,989
- Once he captures the castle...
- Theon has my brothers.

570
00:34:02,023 --> 00:34:06,393
- If we storm the castle...
- He wouldn't dare hurt the boys.

571
00:34:06,427 --> 00:34:10,330
They're his only hope of escaping
the North with his head.

572
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,402
Send word to your son.

573
00:34:15,737 --> 00:34:17,472
Any Ironborn who surrender

574
00:34:17,506 --> 00:34:20,742
will be allowed to return
safely to their homes.

575
00:34:20,777 --> 00:34:24,046
A touch of mercy is a virtue,
Your Grace. Too much...

576
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,749
Any ironborn with the exception
of Theon Greyjoy.

577
00:34:27,784 --> 00:34:30,985
He betrayed our cause.

578
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,288
He betrayed me.

579
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:36,258
And we will hunt him down
no matter where he runs.

580
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:38,709
I expect his countrymen
will turn on him the minute

581
00:34:38,734 --> 00:34:39,939
they hear the offer.

582
00:34:42,732 --> 00:34:45,633
Your pardon, My Lord.
Your Grace.

583
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:47,602
My Lady.

584
00:34:59,112 --> 00:35:00,979
How are you?

585
00:35:01,981 --> 00:35:03,649
How am I?

586
00:35:03,683 --> 00:35:05,917
I've had to arrest my mother.

587
00:35:05,952 --> 00:35:08,354
The Lannisters have my sisters.

588
00:35:08,388 --> 00:35:10,289
The man I considered
my closest friend

589
00:35:10,323 --> 00:35:13,159
has seized my home
and my brothers.

590
00:35:13,193 --> 00:35:16,295
I'm fighting a war and I don't know
if I should march south or north.

591
00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:18,797
I'm sorry.
It was a stupid question.

592
00:35:18,832 --> 00:35:21,100
- I'm sorry.
- No.

593
00:35:21,134 --> 00:35:23,369
Forgive me.

594
00:35:23,403 --> 00:35:25,704
You're being kind.
I have no right.

595
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:27,773
You have every right.

596
00:35:27,807 --> 00:35:29,175
You're a king.

597
00:35:29,209 --> 00:35:31,677
That's not the kind
of king I want to be.

598
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,980
What kind do you want to be?

599
00:35:34,014 --> 00:35:36,716
I don't know. The good kind.

600
00:35:39,586 --> 00:35:42,222
Most kings grew up as princes.

601
00:35:42,256 --> 00:35:45,425
They spend their whole lives
preparing for the crown.

602
00:35:45,459 --> 00:35:48,461
I was raised to be
Lord of Winterfell.

603
00:35:50,031 --> 00:35:52,665
I was raised to be
a proper little lady,

604
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,768
to play the harp
and dance the latest steps

605
00:35:55,802 --> 00:35:57,837
and recite Valyrian poetry.

606
00:35:57,871 --> 00:35:59,472
I'd like to hear you
play the harp.

607
00:35:59,506 --> 00:36:01,641
No. No, you would not.

608
00:36:01,675 --> 00:36:03,543
( Laughs )

609
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,516
How did you go from
reciting Valyrian poetry

610
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,751
to sawing off men's feet?

611
00:36:22,828 --> 00:36:24,862
When I was 12,

612
00:36:24,896 --> 00:36:27,498
my mother and father
went to a wedding.

613
00:36:27,532 --> 00:36:30,801
Weddings in Volantis
last for days, you know.

614
00:36:30,836 --> 00:36:33,071
And they left me
with my little brother.

615
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,675
The second afternoon
they were gone

616
00:36:36,709 --> 00:36:39,745
was the hottest day
in the three-year summer.

617
00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:43,316
We couldn't bear to be inside,
so we ran down to the Rhoyne.

618
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:46,953
Every child in Volantis
was in the Rhoyne that day.

619
00:36:48,756 --> 00:36:51,023
<i>The rich, the poor,
we were all there,</i>

620
00:36:51,057 --> 00:36:54,226
naked, screaming, racing
to the little islands.

621
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,096
Drummers were playing
for coppers on the east bank.

622
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:03,736
I was treading water,

623
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:06,071
talking to a friend

624
00:37:06,105 --> 00:37:08,573
when I realized
I hadn't seen my brother.

625
00:37:10,176 --> 00:37:12,911
I called his name.

626
00:37:12,945 --> 00:37:15,614
Then I started
screaming his name.

627
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:20,284
And then I saw him

628
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:22,419
floating facedown.

629
00:37:24,021 --> 00:37:26,857
My heart just... stopped.

630
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:28,992
I was...

631
00:37:32,263 --> 00:37:34,931
I dragged him from the water.

632
00:37:34,966 --> 00:37:37,501
My friend helped me, I think.

633
00:37:37,535 --> 00:37:39,603
I don't even remember.

634
00:37:42,373 --> 00:37:44,141
He was so little.

635
00:37:45,443 --> 00:37:47,844
Then we pulled him
onto the riverbank...

636
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:52,015
and I screamed at him

637
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,518
and I shook him

638
00:37:54,552 --> 00:37:56,854
and he was dead.

639
00:37:58,022 --> 00:37:59,756
Just dead.

640
00:38:03,494 --> 00:38:05,829
A man ran over.

641
00:38:07,565 --> 00:38:10,801
He had a fish
tattoo on his face.

642
00:38:12,103 --> 00:38:14,472
In Volantis the slaves
have tattoos

643
00:38:14,506 --> 00:38:17,842
so you know what they are
without having to talk to them.

644
00:38:17,876 --> 00:38:20,578
And this man worked
on a fishing boat.

645
00:38:20,612 --> 00:38:23,948
And he pushed me out of the way.

646
00:38:23,982 --> 00:38:25,950
You have to understand,

647
00:38:25,984 --> 00:38:29,153
for a slave to push
a highborn girl...

648
00:38:29,187 --> 00:38:33,023
That's death for the man,
a terrible death.

649
00:38:33,058 --> 00:38:36,960
But he pushed me out of the way

650
00:38:36,994 --> 00:38:41,163
and he started pressing
on my brother's chest

651
00:38:41,198 --> 00:38:45,734
again and again and again

652
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:49,005
until my brother spat out

653
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:51,541
half of the Rhoyne

654
00:38:51,575 --> 00:38:52,976
and cried out.

655
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:56,379
And the man cradled his head
and told him to be calm.

656
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:05,556
I decided two things that day.

657
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,291
I would not waste my years

658
00:39:07,325 --> 00:39:11,496
planning dances and masquerades
with the other noble ladies.

659
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:14,966
And when I came of age...

660
00:39:16,168 --> 00:39:18,703
I would never live
in a slave city again.

661
00:39:25,043 --> 00:39:27,678
( Sighs ) I'm sorry, Your Grace.

662
00:39:27,712 --> 00:39:30,948
You told me of your problems
and I've blathered on.

663
00:39:30,983 --> 00:39:33,384
I don't want to marry
the Frey girl.

664
00:39:37,323 --> 00:39:39,058
I don't want you to marry her.

665
00:39:42,629 --> 00:39:44,997
But you needed that bridge.

666
00:39:47,434 --> 00:39:49,969
I hope it's a very
beautiful bridge.

667
00:40:27,376 --> 00:40:29,443
( Laughs )

668
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:58,071
Hot Pie: <i>The sour cherries was all
crushed up and ready.</i>

669
00:40:58,105 --> 00:40:59,280
Gendry: <i>Shut up.</i>

670
00:40:59,305 --> 00:41:00,930
<i>Probably in the piecrust by now.</i>

671
00:41:01,509 --> 00:41:04,811
In the oven, the nice warm oven.

672
00:41:04,845 --> 00:41:07,347
Shut up. What did you bring?

673
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,283
The cheese could be better.

674
00:41:09,317 --> 00:41:10,951
I did get some nice sausages.

675
00:41:10,985 --> 00:41:13,954
What did he want us
to do about those guards?

676
00:41:13,988 --> 00:41:15,522
He didn't say.

677
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:16,990
He just said,
"walk through the gates."

678
00:41:17,025 --> 00:41:18,993
Gendry: <i>What about the guards?</i>

679
00:41:19,027 --> 00:41:20,762
<i>He didn't say anything
about the guards.</i>

680
00:41:20,796 --> 00:41:22,330
What, he left that bit out?

681
00:41:22,364 --> 00:41:23,965
It's a pretty important part,
don't you think?

682
00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:27,135
- We have to trust him.
- <i>Trust him?</i>

683
00:41:27,169 --> 00:41:29,404
You trusted him to fight with us
and you set him free

684
00:41:29,438 --> 00:41:31,605
- and he ran.
- I want to go back to the kitchens.

685
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,676
Shut up.
Stay here if you're afraid.

686
00:41:37,446 --> 00:41:39,714
Hot Pie: Arry, don't.

687
00:42:07,979 --> 00:42:10,414
Away! Reset!

688
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:22,157
If the wind holds, we'll reach
King's Landing in a day.

689
00:42:22,191 --> 00:42:23,758
Will it hold?

690
00:42:23,793 --> 00:42:26,294
Can't make promises
for the wind, Your Grace.

691
00:42:27,497 --> 00:42:29,898
Man: <i>Again, pull!</i>

692
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:34,904
I admire you, Ser Davos.

693
00:42:34,938 --> 00:42:38,208
I thank you, Your Grace.
Pleased to hear it.

694
00:42:38,242 --> 00:42:40,577
Some highborn fools
call you Onion Knight

695
00:42:40,612 --> 00:42:42,246
and think they insult you.

696
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,582
So you take the onion
for your sigil,

697
00:42:44,616 --> 00:42:47,084
sew it on your coat,
fly the onion flag.

698
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,320
My son wishes me to change it.

699
00:42:49,354 --> 00:42:52,556
Three mermen with tridents,
something like that.

700
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:56,393
I understand why the older
families look down at me.

701
00:42:56,427 --> 00:42:58,661
Do you? Why?

702
00:42:58,696 --> 00:43:01,697
- My father was a crabber.
- And?

703
00:43:01,732 --> 00:43:05,301
Well, sons of Lords don't like to
break bread with sons of crabbers.

704
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:07,236
Our hands stink.

705
00:43:07,271 --> 00:43:09,839
And where were those Lords
when Storm's End starved?

706
00:43:09,873 --> 00:43:12,175
Many fought bravely
for your brother.

707
00:43:12,209 --> 00:43:14,710
Many fought for the Mad King.

708
00:43:14,744 --> 00:43:18,715
You defend these men
who insult you behind your back.

709
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:21,051
Some are happy
to do it to my face.

710
00:43:21,086 --> 00:43:23,321
We were forgotten.

711
00:43:23,355 --> 00:43:25,990
Robert and Ned Stark...
They were the heroes,

712
00:43:26,025 --> 00:43:29,727
the glorious rebels marching
from battle to battle,

713
00:43:29,762 --> 00:43:32,363
liberating towns from
the yoke of the Mad King

714
00:43:32,397 --> 00:43:35,065
while I held Storm's End
with 500 men.

715
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:37,033
- No one has forgotten, Your Grace.
- No? Robert did.

716
00:43:37,068 --> 00:43:39,168
He gave Storm's End
to Renly after the war.

717
00:43:39,203 --> 00:43:40,736
Renly never fought
a day in his life.

718
00:43:40,771 --> 00:43:43,806
- He was only a boy.
- Then why'd he give him Storm's End?

719
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:49,311
First we ate the horses.

720
00:43:49,345 --> 00:43:52,682
We weren't riding anyway,
not with the castle surrounded.

721
00:43:52,716 --> 00:43:55,385
We couldn't feed them,
so fine, the horses.

722
00:43:55,419 --> 00:43:57,420
Then the cats. Never liked cats.

723
00:43:57,454 --> 00:44:00,191
So fine. I do like dogs.

724
00:44:00,225 --> 00:44:01,859
Good animals. Loyal.

725
00:44:01,894 --> 00:44:04,329
But we ate them. Then the rats.

726
00:44:04,363 --> 00:44:06,565
The night before
you slipped through,

727
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:08,467
I thought my wife was dying.

728
00:44:08,501 --> 00:44:10,735
She couldn't speak anymore,
she was so frail.

729
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:13,939
And then you made it
through the lines.

730
00:44:13,973 --> 00:44:17,309
Slipped right through in your little
black sailboat with your onions.

731
00:44:17,343 --> 00:44:20,111
And potatoes.
Some salted beef, I believe.

732
00:44:20,146 --> 00:44:22,881
Every man in Storm's End
wanted to kiss you that night.

733
00:44:22,915 --> 00:44:25,250
I was relieved they did not.

734
00:44:26,987 --> 00:44:30,422
Robert told me to hold
Storm's End, so I held it.

735
00:44:31,825 --> 00:44:33,926
Then he told me
he was giving it to Renly,

736
00:44:33,961 --> 00:44:35,261
so I gave it up.

737
00:44:35,295 --> 00:44:37,697
Insult or no, I gave it up

738
00:44:37,731 --> 00:44:39,999
because Robert was my older brother
and he was the king

739
00:44:40,034 --> 00:44:42,202
and I've always done my duty.

740
00:44:42,236 --> 00:44:46,172
But now I'm the rightful king by
every law of Westeros.

741
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:48,775
And when I sit the Iron Throne,
you'll be my Hand.

742
00:44:51,613 --> 00:44:53,614
Your Grace...

743
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:57,485
I pray I serve you well.

744
00:44:59,054 --> 00:45:01,722
I expect you'll be the first crabber's
son to wear the badge.

745
00:45:06,428 --> 00:45:08,229
You're the master of whisperers.

746
00:45:08,263 --> 00:45:09,997
You're supposed
to know everything.

747
00:45:10,031 --> 00:45:12,934
No man can be in all
rooms at all times.

748
00:45:12,968 --> 00:45:16,004
I have many little birds
in the North, My Lord,

749
00:45:16,038 --> 00:45:17,839
but I haven't heard their songs

750
00:45:17,873 --> 00:45:20,574
since Theon Greyjoy
captured Winterfell.

751
00:45:20,609 --> 00:45:22,210
The Stark forces are distracted.

752
00:45:22,244 --> 00:45:24,178
Now is the time to strike.

753
00:45:24,213 --> 00:45:25,946
To strike?

754
00:45:25,981 --> 00:45:27,948
My dear nephew,
you do see these men

755
00:45:27,983 --> 00:45:29,650
preparing the walls for siege?

756
00:45:29,684 --> 00:45:33,220
You do understand
Stannis Baratheon sails this way?

757
00:45:33,254 --> 00:45:35,655
If my Uncle Stannis lands on
the shores of King's Landing,

758
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:37,657
I'll ride out to greet him.

759
00:45:37,691 --> 00:45:39,592
A brave choice, Your Grace.

760
00:45:39,627 --> 00:45:42,461
I'm sure your men
will line up behind you.

761
00:45:42,495 --> 00:45:45,397
They say Stannis never smiles.

762
00:45:45,431 --> 00:45:48,099
I'll give him a red smile

763
00:45:48,134 --> 00:45:50,268
from ear to ear.

764
00:45:54,741 --> 00:45:57,643
Imagine Stannis's terror.

765
00:45:57,677 --> 00:45:59,745
I am trying.

766
00:46:00,914 --> 00:46:02,648
You're an intelligent man.

767
00:46:02,682 --> 00:46:04,383
I'd like to think
I'm an intelligent man.

768
00:46:04,418 --> 00:46:05,985
Oh, no one disputes
that, My Lord,

769
00:46:06,019 --> 00:46:08,287
not even the multitudes
who despise you.

770
00:46:08,322 --> 00:46:11,224
I wish we could converse
as two honest, intelligent men.

771
00:46:11,259 --> 00:46:13,093
I wish we could, too.

772
00:46:15,363 --> 00:46:17,331
What do you want?

773
00:46:17,365 --> 00:46:19,567
Tell me.

774
00:46:19,601 --> 00:46:21,469
If we're going to play,

775
00:46:21,503 --> 00:46:23,805
you'll have to start.

776
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:31,945
My brother was the youngest
Kingsguard in history.

777
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:35,782
My sister became queen
at the age of 19.

778
00:46:37,451 --> 00:46:39,218
When I reached manhood,

779
00:46:39,253 --> 00:46:41,079
my father put me
in charge of all the drains

780
00:46:41,104 --> 00:46:42,965
and cisterns in Casterly Rock.

781
00:46:43,323 --> 00:46:45,357
A most highborn plumber.

782
00:46:45,392 --> 00:46:47,493
The water never flowed better.

783
00:46:47,527 --> 00:46:50,463
And all the shit
found its way to the sea.

784
00:46:50,497 --> 00:46:53,300
I never expected
to have any real power.

785
00:46:53,334 --> 00:46:55,536
So when my father
named me acting Hand...

786
00:46:55,571 --> 00:46:57,672
You're quite good
at being Hand, you know?

787
00:46:57,706 --> 00:47:00,542
Jon Arryn and Ned Stark
were good men,

788
00:47:00,576 --> 00:47:02,610
honorable men,

789
00:47:02,645 --> 00:47:05,481
but they disdained the game
and those who played.

790
00:47:05,515 --> 00:47:08,050
- You enjoy the game.
- I do.

791
00:47:08,084 --> 00:47:10,586
Last thing I expected.

792
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:12,087
And you play it well.

793
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:14,189
I'd like to keep playing it.

794
00:47:16,693 --> 00:47:19,628
If Stannis breaches
the gates, the game is over.

795
00:47:19,662 --> 00:47:22,296
They say he burns
his enemies alive

796
00:47:22,331 --> 00:47:24,366
to honor the Lord of Light.

797
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,734
The Lord of Light
wants his enemies burned,

798
00:47:26,769 --> 00:47:29,270
the Drowned God
wants them drowned.

799
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:31,306
Why are all the Gods
such vicious cunts?

800
00:47:31,341 --> 00:47:34,877
Where is the God
of tits and wine?

801
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,812
In the Summer Isles,

802
00:47:36,846 --> 00:47:39,848
they worship a fertility
goddess with 16 teats.

803
00:47:39,883 --> 00:47:42,551
We should sail there
immediately.

804
00:47:44,388 --> 00:47:47,757
This morning I heard a song

805
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:51,293
all the way from Qarth
beyond the Red Waste.

806
00:47:51,328 --> 00:47:53,295
Daenerys Targaryen lives.

807
00:47:54,998 --> 00:47:57,900
A girl at the edge of the world
is the least of our problems.

808
00:47:57,935 --> 00:48:00,368
She has three dragons.

809
00:48:01,938 --> 00:48:04,172
But even if what
they say is true,

810
00:48:04,206 --> 00:48:07,141
it'll be years before
they are fully grown.

811
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:09,844
And then there will be
nowhere to hide.

812
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:13,248
One game at a time, my friend.

813
00:48:13,282 --> 00:48:15,783
( Men shouting )

814
00:48:23,425 --> 00:48:25,592
Jorah: <i>Careful, Khaleesi.</i>

815
00:48:25,627 --> 00:48:28,008
<i>Xaro owns this city
and the warlocks have 1,000</i>

816
00:48:28,033 --> 00:48:29,798
<i>eyes watching for you.</i>

817
00:48:30,398 --> 00:48:33,267
I found one...

818
00:48:33,301 --> 00:48:35,768
A ship with a good captain.

819
00:48:35,803 --> 00:48:38,405
She leaves for Astapor tomorrow.

820
00:48:38,439 --> 00:48:40,607
- Astapor?
- We cannot stay here.

821
00:48:40,641 --> 00:48:41,894
They have my dragons.

822
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,827
A mother does not flee
without her children.

823
00:48:43,945 --> 00:48:46,012
They're not your children.

824
00:48:46,047 --> 00:48:48,648
I know they call you
the Mother of Dragons

825
00:48:48,682 --> 00:48:51,451
and I know you love them, but you
didn't grow them in your womb.

826
00:48:51,485 --> 00:48:54,053
They didn't suckle at your breast.
They are dragons, Khaleesi.

827
00:48:54,087 --> 00:48:56,489
And if we stay
in Qarth, we'll die.

828
00:48:56,523 --> 00:48:59,592
You should sail to Astapor.
I'm sure you'll be safe there.

829
00:49:02,062 --> 00:49:05,164
You know I would die for you.

830
00:49:05,198 --> 00:49:07,900
I will never abandon you.

831
00:49:07,934 --> 00:49:10,236
I'm sworn to protect you,
to serve.

832
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:12,338
Then serve me.

833
00:49:12,372 --> 00:49:14,669
If my dragons are in
the House of the Undying,

834
00:49:14,694 --> 00:49:15,841
then take me there.

835
00:49:15,842 --> 00:49:17,743
That's what the warlock wants.

836
00:49:17,777 --> 00:49:19,579
He told you so himself.

837
00:49:19,613 --> 00:49:22,248
If you enter that place,
you will never leave again.

838
00:49:22,282 --> 00:49:25,285
- His magic is strong.
- And what of my magic?

839
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:27,320
You saw me step into the fire.

840
00:49:27,355 --> 00:49:29,823
You watched the witch burn.
What did the flames do to me?

841
00:49:29,857 --> 00:49:31,792
Do you remember?

842
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:37,065
Until my last breath
I will remember.

843
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:41,737
After I have forgotten
my mother's face.

844
00:49:46,077 --> 00:49:48,678
They are my children.

845
00:49:48,713 --> 00:49:53,049
And they are the only
children I will ever have.

846
00:49:58,655 --> 00:50:00,790
Take me to them.

847
00:50:12,602 --> 00:50:14,837
We should bury them.

848
00:50:14,871 --> 00:50:17,172
I'd leave 'em up
a few more days.

849
00:50:17,207 --> 00:50:19,274
Sends a message.

850
00:50:19,309 --> 00:50:20,909
If they haven't got
the damn message yet,

851
00:50:20,943 --> 00:50:22,978
a few more days won't help.

852
00:50:23,012 --> 00:50:24,613
As you say.

853
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:27,582
But it don't hurt to let
'em rot a while longer.

854
00:50:27,617 --> 00:50:29,518
What's this?

855
00:50:29,552 --> 00:50:31,854
Gold for the farmer.

856
00:50:31,888 --> 00:50:34,557
For his trouble.

857
00:50:34,591 --> 00:50:35,959
His troubles are done.

858
00:50:35,993 --> 00:50:39,563
He's feeding the crops now.

859
00:50:39,597 --> 00:50:41,466
<i>His wife, too.</i>

860
00:50:43,302 --> 00:50:46,171
You want to keep a man
silent, you silence him.

861
00:51:05,692 --> 00:51:09,361
Got as far as the farm
and then doubled back.

862
00:51:10,997 --> 00:51:14,133
Walked through the stream
to throw off the hounds.

863
00:51:16,103 --> 00:51:19,438
Hoped this would be the
last place they'd think to look.

864
00:51:21,742 --> 00:51:23,643
You're right...

865
00:51:23,678 --> 00:51:26,379
so far.

866
00:51:26,413 --> 00:51:28,648
Who was that out there

867
00:51:28,682 --> 00:51:31,283
hung up the gates?

868
00:51:31,317 --> 00:51:34,019
Must have been
the farmer's boys.

869
00:51:35,588 --> 00:51:38,957
He killed them and burned them

870
00:51:38,992 --> 00:51:41,593
<i>and passed them off
as the little lords?</i>

871
00:51:41,628 --> 00:51:43,395
Shh, shh, shh.

872
00:51:43,429 --> 00:51:46,064
<i>They mustn't know.</i>

873
00:51:46,099 --> 00:51:48,800
<i>Bran would blame himself.</i>

874
00:51:48,834 --> 00:51:52,403
Osha: <i>They'll never
hear it from me.</i>

875
00:51:52,438 --> 00:51:55,473
<i>The little lads
have suffered enough.</i>
