2
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:52,870
- Valar morghulis.
- Valar dohaeris.

3
00:03:29,682 --> 00:03:31,948
I've been sweeping this floor for days.

4
00:03:32,822 --> 00:03:35,845
- Good.
- I didn't come here to sweep floors.

5
00:03:36,814 --> 00:03:39,283
No? Why come than?

6
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,134
You said that I could be your apprentice.

7
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:45,901
You said you'd teach me
how to a Faceless Man.

8
00:03:46,064 --> 00:03:47,580
A man teaches a girl.

9
00:03:49,908 --> 00:03:52,963
Valar dohaeris.
All men must serve.

10
00:03:54,095 --> 00:03:55,415
Faceless men, most of all.

11
00:03:57,822 --> 00:03:59,126
I want to serve.

12
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:05,009
A girl wants to serve herself.

13
00:04:05,306 --> 00:04:08,665
Here we serve the Many-Faced God,
to serve well.

14
00:04:09,642 --> 00:04:13,298
- A girl must become no-one.
- Which one is the Many-Faced God?

15
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,103
I see the Stranger, I see the Drowned God,

16
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,516
- I see the Weirwood Face.
- There is only one god.

17
00:04:21,212 --> 00:04:22,837
A girl knows his name.

18
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:25,524
And no man know his gift.

19
00:05:03,813 --> 00:05:05,219
Where are they taking him?

20
00:05:29,271 --> 00:05:30,302
Queen Margaery!

21
00:05:32,904 --> 00:05:33,802
Queen Margaery!

22
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:38,216
Queen Margaery!

23
00:05:45,755 --> 00:05:48,271
- I'm his, and he's mine.
- I'm hers, and she's mine.

24
00:05:48,755 --> 00:05:52,067
- From this day until the end of my days.
- From this day until the end of my days.

25
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,184
- Did I hurt you?
- No. You were lovely.

26
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:43,404
- It all happened so fast.
- Yes.

27
00:06:43,888 --> 00:06:46,247
I was scared maybe I hurt you,
it sounded like...

28
00:06:46,248 --> 00:06:47,661
No, no, no...

29
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:49,709
you're very sweet.

30
00:06:50,514 --> 00:06:52,920
The sweetest king who ever lived.

31
00:06:53,764 --> 00:06:58,708
This is what I want to do all day,
every day for the rest of my life.

32
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,709
Wouldn't that be glorious?

33
00:07:02,365 --> 00:07:04,123
Shouldn't we rest a little while?

34
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,678
Just to catch our breath,
there's no rush, is there?

35
00:07:07,077 --> 00:07:08,163
Of course not.

36
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:10,538
Are you hungry?

37
00:07:10,726 --> 00:07:13,155
Shall I have them bring you some cake
or pomegranate juice...?

38
00:07:13,156 --> 00:07:14,632
No, I'm fine...

39
00:07:15,328 --> 00:07:17,430
I just want you all to myself.

40
00:07:18,281 --> 00:07:23,484
I want to know everything there is to know
about King Tommen First of His Name.

41
00:07:24,117 --> 00:07:27,773
King Tommen...
it still sounds strange to me.

42
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,788
Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?

43
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:36,671
- So strange. Husband.
- Wife.

44
00:07:39,906 --> 00:07:41,476
Sometimes it feels odd.

45
00:07:42,234 --> 00:07:47,250
I'm the king, I've married
the most beautiful woman in the world,

46
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,141
and it's all because my brother died.

47
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,484
I understand.

48
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,117
But it's no your fault,
you know that, don't you?

49
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,390
You mustn't feel guilty.

50
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:03,359
I don't feel guilty.
That's what's odd.

51
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:08,671
Do you like to sail?

52
00:08:09,248 --> 00:08:11,889
- I love to sail.
- I do, too.

53
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,740
I think we're going to be very happy,
you and I.

54
00:08:16,522 --> 00:08:17,561
I do, too.

55
00:08:20,522 --> 00:08:25,030
Living in a tower so high,
it touches the clouds.

56
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,483
Of course my grandmother
couldn't wait to go home.

57
00:08:29,787 --> 00:08:32,310
The capital is not for everyone, I suppose.

58
00:08:34,576 --> 00:08:36,225
Does your mother like it here?

59
00:08:37,694 --> 00:08:38,952
I don't think so.

60
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:41,779
She told me never to trust anyone
in King's Landing.

61
00:08:43,897 --> 00:08:46,452
It's so wonderful to have her
watching over you.

62
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:49,319
A lioness guiding her cub.

63
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:52,632
Well, but I'm a man now.

64
00:08:54,858 --> 00:08:56,046
You are.

65
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,155
And the king.

66
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:04,422
But you'll always be her baby-boy.

67
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:05,978
I suppose.

68
00:09:07,368 --> 00:09:11,126
I adore how she has always been
so generous with me, so kind.

69
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:14,626
And the horror she's had to endure.

70
00:09:14,923 --> 00:09:18,189
Losing her husband,
her eldest child and her father.

71
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,399
It's no wonder she's so protective of you.

72
00:09:20,946 --> 00:09:23,368
She'll never let you out of her sight.

73
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:28,618
You're very much in love.

74
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:32,001
The first days of marriage
are often so blissful.

75
00:09:32,383 --> 00:09:34,086
She's certainly very pretty, isn't she?

76
00:09:35,422 --> 00:09:38,547
Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot.

77
00:09:40,024 --> 00:09:44,406
Do you think she's intelligent?
I can't quite tell.

78
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:48,539
- Not that it matters.
- Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?

79
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,540
There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.

80
00:09:51,742 --> 00:09:53,203
That's where you grew up.

81
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,477
You always told me
that you liked the people there better.

82
00:09:58,109 --> 00:10:01,632
You said that King's Landing
smelled of horse dung and sour milk.

83
00:10:04,468 --> 00:10:08,452
- Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?
- The way that you talked about it...

84
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:10,749
I always thought that you missed it.

85
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:16,320
- That you... That it was your real home.
- This is my real home now.

86
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:18,321
Where my family lives.

87
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:21,064
I want you to be happy, mother.

88
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,165
I know that.

89
00:10:25,102 --> 00:10:29,883
- I know you do, my sweet boy.
- But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock?

90
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:38,157
I said, "Darling, surely 4 times is enough,
are you trying to set a new record?"

91
00:10:38,158 --> 00:10:42,087
And he said, "Well, what is the record?
I'm sure we can break it."

92
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:48,267
Mother.

93
00:10:49,205 --> 00:10:50,174
Welcome.

94
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:52,914
Well don't you look lovely.

95
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:54,401
Marriage agrees with you.

96
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:57,123
Can we bring you anything to eat or drink?

97
00:10:57,243 --> 00:11:00,710
I wish we had some wine for you.
It's a bit early in the day for us.

98
00:11:02,726 --> 00:11:05,257
No, no, I...I can't stay.

99
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:07,969
I just wanted to let you know if...

100
00:11:08,806 --> 00:11:10,632
there is ever anything I can do for you.

101
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:12,206
You are very sweet.

102
00:11:12,691 --> 00:11:14,917
Tommen seems quite taken
with his new queen.

103
00:11:15,037 --> 00:11:17,927
I absolutely adore him.

104
00:11:18,047 --> 00:11:19,902
You raised a gallant young man.

105
00:11:20,152 --> 00:11:21,927
- I'm forever grateful.
- Good.

106
00:11:23,764 --> 00:11:24,701
Good.

107
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:26,427
I'm glad to hear you're happy.

108
00:11:26,434 --> 00:11:28,582
Ecstatic. I really am.

109
00:11:29,015 --> 00:11:31,615
Exhausted, to be honest, but

110
00:11:31,735 --> 00:11:34,641
what can I expect, he is
half lion, half stag.

111
00:11:36,713 --> 00:11:38,150
I'll leave you to it then.

112
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:43,231
Oh, forgive me, I haven't been at
Court for long, I get so confused.

113
00:11:43,351 --> 00:11:45,519
What's the proper way to address you now?

114
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,610
Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?

115
00:11:49,915 --> 00:11:51,690
There's no need for such formalities.

116
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,994
In any event, judging from
the King's enthusiasm,

117
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,656
the Queen Mother will be a
Queen Grandmother soon.

118
00:11:57,776 --> 00:11:59,035
That'll be a lovely day.

119
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,797
Imagine the celebrations.

120
00:12:00,917 --> 00:12:03,132
They'll ring the bells all day and night.

121
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:03,970
Remember.

122
00:12:05,982 --> 00:12:07,244
Anything you need.

123
00:13:22,908 --> 00:13:25,105
We can't hold the North with terror alone.

124
00:13:25,225 --> 00:13:28,035
You can't hold the North if you
let these lesser lords insult us.

125
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:30,812
I sent you there to collect
taxes, not bodies.

126
00:13:30,932 --> 00:13:32,918
Lord Cerwyn refused to pay.

127
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,125
He said the Warden of the
North will always be a Stark,

128
00:13:36,245 --> 00:13:38,607
and he'd be damned if he
kissed a traitor's boot.

129
00:13:41,326 --> 00:13:43,396
You left him no choice.

130
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:44,958
I flayed him living,

131
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:47,322
along with his wife and brother.

132
00:13:47,662 --> 00:13:49,212
I made his son watch.

133
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:52,112
And?

134
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:54,275
The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.

135
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:03,040
I have something important to tell you.

136
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,566
Stop eating and listen.

137
00:14:15,948 --> 00:14:17,810
We don't have enough men to hold the North

138
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,985
if the other Houses rise up against us.

139
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,885
Do you understand that?

140
00:14:22,005 --> 00:14:23,347
Our pact with the Lannisters...

141
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:25,697
I had a pact with Tywin Lannister.

142
00:14:25,817 --> 00:14:27,207
Tywin Lannister is dead.

143
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,489
The remaining Lannisters are a thousand
miles away dealing with that fact.

144
00:14:31,739 --> 00:14:34,099
They've never once in the
history of the Seven Kingdoms

145
00:14:34,219 --> 00:14:35,955
sent their army this far north.

146
00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:38,537
If you think they will for us,
you're a fool.

147
00:14:40,006 --> 00:14:43,568
We become a great House by entering
in alliances with other Houses,

148
00:14:43,688 --> 00:14:46,466
and parleying those alliances
into greater power.

149
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:49,435
Now the best way to forge
a lasting alliance

150
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,013
isn't by peeling a man's skin off,

151
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:54,103
the best way is marriage.

152
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:57,981
Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree,

153
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:00,969
it's time you married a suitable bride.

154
00:15:04,505 --> 00:15:05,946
And as it happens,

155
00:15:06,361 --> 00:15:09,730
I found the perfect girl to
solidify our hold in the North.

156
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,153
- That's Moat Cailin.
- Yes.

157
00:15:34,273 --> 00:15:36,061
A bit shabby, isn't it?

158
00:15:36,595 --> 00:15:38,540
You've been here before.

159
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:42,965
On our way down to King's Landing,
with my father and Arya and...

160
00:15:43,538 --> 00:15:46,627
- Where are you taking me?
- Home.

161
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,851
The Boltons have Winterfell.

162
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,893
The marriage proposal...It wasn't for you?

163
00:15:57,992 --> 00:15:59,457
No.

164
00:15:59,884 --> 00:16:04,157
Roose Bolton murdered my brother.
He betrayed my family!

165
00:16:04,277 --> 00:16:06,047
He did.

166
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:07,797
He serves the Lannisters.

167
00:16:08,273 --> 00:16:10,685
- For now.
- I won't go.

168
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:12,754
- Winterfell is your home.
- Not anymore.

169
00:16:12,874 --> 00:16:15,479
Always. You're a Stark.

170
00:16:16,126 --> 00:16:18,838
Dyeing your hair doesn't change that.
You're Sansa Stark.

171
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:21,807
The eldest surviving child
of Ned and Catelyn Stark.

172
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,925
Your place is in the North.

173
00:16:24,045 --> 00:16:25,888
I can't marry him.
You can't make me.

174
00:16:26,008 --> 00:16:28,158
He's a traitor.
A murderer.

175
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,965
You're not marrying Roose Bolton.

176
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:33,208
No, you'll be marrying his son and heir,
Ramsay.

177
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,081
- One day he'll be Warden of the North and...
- No!

178
00:16:36,337 --> 00:16:38,337
- Sansa...
- No, you can't make me.

179
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:41,715
I will starve myself. I will
die before I have to go there.

180
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,178
I won't force you to do anything.

181
00:16:45,206 --> 00:16:47,118
Don't you know by now how
much I care for you?

182
00:16:48,587 --> 00:16:51,037
Say the word and we turn the
horses round, but listen to me.

183
00:16:51,157 --> 00:16:52,312
Listen.

184
00:16:52,824 --> 00:16:54,724
You've been running all your life.

185
00:16:56,236 --> 00:16:58,599
Terrible things happened to
your family and you weep.

186
00:16:58,955 --> 00:17:01,992
You sit alone in a dark room,
mourning their fates.

187
00:17:02,112 --> 00:17:06,016
You've been a bystander to tragedy from
the day they executed your father.

188
00:17:06,773 --> 00:17:10,606
Stop being a bystander, you hear me?
Stop running.

189
00:17:15,726 --> 00:17:17,589
There's no justice in the world.

190
00:17:18,502 --> 00:17:20,202
Not unless we make it.

191
00:17:22,052 --> 00:17:23,476
You loved your family.

192
00:17:25,195 --> 00:17:26,632
Avenge them.

193
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,507
How do we get through there?

194
00:18:30,107 --> 00:18:31,145
We don't.

195
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,483
We go around.

196
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,707
It sets miles out of the way.

197
00:18:35,857 --> 00:18:38,133
- We'll lose sight of them.
- Doesn't matter.

198
00:18:38,253 --> 00:18:39,513
I know where they're going.

199
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,813
Don't you get a bit old for a squire?

200
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,763
How did you end up squiring for the Imp?

201
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:54,789
He hates that nickname.

202
00:18:54,909 --> 00:18:57,226
Well, he's not here to
complain about it, is he?

203
00:19:01,838 --> 00:19:05,326
I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer
during the War of the Five Kings.

204
00:19:05,446 --> 00:19:06,426
One night,

205
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,588
he had a bit too much to drink.

206
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:11,038
And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham.

207
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:13,597
- He borrowed it?
- He wasn't a thief.

208
00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:16,325
He was drunk and hungry
and he wasn't thinking.

209
00:19:16,445 --> 00:19:17,700
I was drunk too.

210
00:19:18,563 --> 00:19:19,937
He gave me half the ham.

211
00:19:21,863 --> 00:19:23,200
Next morning,

212
00:19:23,756 --> 00:19:25,993
one of the guards saw him passed out,

213
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,728
under a wagon, with the ham
bone still in his hand.

214
00:19:30,097 --> 00:19:31,589
They hanged the man after noon.

215
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,733
They tied the noose for me too,

216
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:37,370
but Lord Tywin heard my
family name was Payne,

217
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,669
so he pardoned me,

218
00:19:39,104 --> 00:19:41,579
and sent me to King's Landing
to squire for his son.

219
00:19:41,699 --> 00:19:43,017
Punishment?

220
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,255
- For both of you.
- It didn't seem that way.

221
00:19:46,817 --> 00:19:48,742
Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.

222
00:19:48,862 --> 00:19:51,104
I guess all of your lords
were very kind to you.

223
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:52,791
All except me.

224
00:19:52,911 --> 00:19:55,357
Sorry you have to squire
such a nasty person.

225
00:19:55,477 --> 00:19:57,945
I'm not sorry. You're the
best fighter I've ever seen.

226
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,458
You beat The Hound.

227
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:02,810
I'm proud to be your squire.

228
00:20:08,013 --> 00:20:10,017
I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.

229
00:20:10,137 --> 00:20:12,878
If you wouldn't snap at me
I wouldn't learn anything.

230
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:19,125
You want to be a knight, Pod?

231
00:20:20,234 --> 00:20:20,871
Yes.

232
00:20:20,991 --> 00:20:23,597
Starting tomorrow, we'll train
with the sword twice a day,

233
00:20:23,717 --> 00:20:26,544
before we ride in the morning and
after we camp for the evening.

234
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,392
And I'm going to show you
how to ride properly.

235
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:30,255
Thank you.

236
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,521
I can't knight you,

237
00:20:31,641 --> 00:20:32,962
but I can teach you how to fight.

238
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:34,458
I suppose that's more important.

239
00:20:47,449 --> 00:20:48,599
You weren't a knight, but

240
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:51,975
you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon,
weren't you?

241
00:20:53,437 --> 00:20:54,362
I was.

242
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,687
Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.

243
00:20:59,471 --> 00:21:00,497
He was.

244
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:04,147
But how did you end up serving Renly?

245
00:21:10,755 --> 00:21:13,368
When I was a girl,
my father held a ball.

246
00:21:13,488 --> 00:21:16,780
I'm his only living child, so he wants
to make a good match for me.

247
00:21:17,168 --> 00:21:19,671
He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth.

248
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,421
I didn't want to go, but he dragged me
to the ballroom.

249
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:27,346
And it was wonderful.

250
00:21:30,048 --> 00:21:33,298
None of the boys noticed
how mulish and tall I was.

251
00:21:34,723 --> 00:21:36,923
The shaft each other and threatened to duel

252
00:21:37,043 --> 00:21:38,910
if they thought it was their turn to dance.

253
00:21:40,829 --> 00:21:42,142
Whispered in my ear

254
00:21:42,705 --> 00:21:45,979
how they wanted to marry me and take me
back to their castles.

255
00:21:48,325 --> 00:21:51,453
My father smiled at me and I smiled at him.

256
00:21:53,323 --> 00:21:55,383
I'd never been so happy.

257
00:21:58,778 --> 00:22:01,219
Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering.

258
00:22:03,241 --> 00:22:06,674
And then they all started to laugh, they
couldn't keep the game going any longer.

259
00:22:07,628 --> 00:22:09,154
They were toying with me.

260
00:22:10,756 --> 00:22:14,451
Brienne the Beauty, they called me.
Great joke.

261
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,357
And I realized I was the
ugliest girl alive.

262
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,216
A great lumbering beast.

263
00:22:28,044 --> 00:22:32,278
I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon
took me in his arms.

264
00:22:32,911 --> 00:22:35,223
Don't let them see your tears, he told me.

265
00:22:35,805 --> 00:22:37,417
The nasty little shits,

266
00:22:37,729 --> 00:22:39,979
nasty little shits aren't worth
crying over.

267
00:22:41,954 --> 00:22:44,434
He danced with me and none of the
other boys could say a word.

268
00:22:46,216 --> 00:22:48,279
And he was the king's brother after all.

269
00:22:50,768 --> 00:22:52,437
But...wasn't he...

270
00:22:54,576 --> 00:22:56,797
Lord Tyrion said he was...

271
00:22:58,262 --> 00:23:00,899
Yes, Pod, he liked men,
I'm not an idiot.

272
00:23:01,514 --> 00:23:03,467
He didn't love me, he didn't want me,

273
00:23:03,587 --> 00:23:06,572
he danced with me because he was kind
and he wouldn't see me hurt.

274
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:10,129
He saved me from being a joke.

275
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:11,754
From that day

276
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,004
until his last day.

277
00:23:16,922 --> 00:23:18,985
And I couldn't save him in return.

278
00:23:22,883 --> 00:23:26,374
Nothing's more hateful than failing
to protect the one you love.

279
00:23:28,744 --> 00:23:30,972
One day, I will avenge King Renly.

280
00:23:31,521 --> 00:23:33,322
But you said a shadow murdered him.

281
00:23:34,971 --> 00:23:36,046
How do you fight a shadow?

282
00:23:36,308 --> 00:23:38,858
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

283
00:23:40,017 --> 00:23:41,279
I know it was Stannis.

284
00:23:41,493 --> 00:23:43,325
I know it in my heart.

285
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:49,337
Stannis is a man, not a shadow.

286
00:23:49,826 --> 00:23:51,217
And a man...

287
00:23:51,852 --> 00:23:53,986
can be killed.

288
00:23:56,397 --> 00:23:58,276
- Lord Commander.
- Your Grace.

289
00:23:58,576 --> 00:24:00,305
I'd like to speak alone.

290
00:24:00,425 --> 00:24:05,155
Ollie is my steward now, as I was
Lord Commander Mormont's.

291
00:24:05,848 --> 00:24:09,872
I want him to attend my meetings,
to learn from men with experience.

292
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:13,423
One day, he might command.

293
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:20,350
Very well. Have you considered my offer?

294
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,103
I have.

295
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,603
And I thank you for it.
You do me great honor.

296
00:24:26,896 --> 00:24:29,233
All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.

297
00:24:29,353 --> 00:24:30,513
Say the word and you will be.

298
00:24:32,987 --> 00:24:34,524
But I have to refuse you.

299
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,305
I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

300
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:39,957
My place is here.

301
00:24:40,332 --> 00:24:42,707
I'm giving you a chance
to avenge your family.

302
00:24:44,264 --> 00:24:46,828
Take back the castle where you grew up.

303
00:24:48,805 --> 00:24:50,246
To rule the North.

304
00:24:50,913 --> 00:24:52,675
I wish I could fight beside you.

305
00:24:53,675 --> 00:24:55,013
Believe me, I do.

306
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:58,232
But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood.

307
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:01,475
I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.

308
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,588
You're as stubborn as your father.

309
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,175
And as honorable.

310
00:25:06,712 --> 00:25:08,174
I can imagine no higher praise.

311
00:25:08,294 --> 00:25:09,637
I didn't mean it as praise.

312
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,612
Honor got your father killed.

313
00:25:12,693 --> 00:25:14,681
But if your mind is made up,
I won't try to persuade you.

314
00:25:14,801 --> 00:25:16,219
Can I ask Your Grace

315
00:25:16,339 --> 00:25:17,979
how long you plan to stay
at Castle Black?

316
00:25:18,015 --> 00:25:19,471
Are you bored of us already?

317
00:25:21,345 --> 00:25:23,071
You saved us from Mance Rayder's army.

318
00:25:23,383 --> 00:25:24,783
We will never forget that.

319
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,808
But it's a question of survival.

320
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:31,739
Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men
and the wildling prisoners indefinitely.

321
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:34,454
Mm, winter is coming.

322
00:25:36,372 --> 00:25:37,298
I know it.

323
00:25:37,823 --> 00:25:39,923
We march on Winterfell within a fortnight.

324
00:25:40,197 --> 00:25:41,860
Before the snows trap us here.

325
00:25:43,103 --> 00:25:44,453
And the wildlings?

326
00:25:44,703 --> 00:25:46,915
They'd rather burn than fight for me,
so be it.

327
00:25:47,035 --> 00:25:48,577
I leave their fate to you.

328
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,715
You could execute them,
that's the safest course.

329
00:25:56,457 --> 00:25:58,981
Or you could see if this Tormund fellow
is more willing

330
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:01,037
to compromise than Mance ever was.

331
00:26:01,157 --> 00:26:04,318
I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch
would rather see the wildlings dead.

332
00:26:04,531 --> 00:26:06,019
Most of the brothers, yes.

333
00:26:07,491 --> 00:26:09,604
There's little love for the free folk here.

334
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:11,617
You're Lord Commander.

335
00:26:11,979 --> 00:26:13,067
Your decision.

336
00:26:15,344 --> 00:26:16,953
You have many enemies in Castle Black.

337
00:26:17,073 --> 00:26:19,969
Have you considered sending
Alliser Thorne elsewhere?

338
00:26:21,514 --> 00:26:23,654
Give him command of Eastwach-by-the-Sea.

339
00:26:24,092 --> 00:26:26,514
I heard it was best to
keep your enemies close.

340
00:26:26,634 --> 00:26:28,623
Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.

341
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,370
He sees something in you.

342
00:26:40,104 --> 00:26:42,417
Might not be apparent from his tone,

343
00:26:43,229 --> 00:26:45,213
but it's the truth. He believes in you.

344
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,089
I'm sorry I disappointed him.

345
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:54,277
The king is a complicated man.

346
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:57,511
But he wants what's right
for the Seven Kingdoms.

347
00:26:57,631 --> 00:26:58,933
As long as he's ruling them.

348
00:26:59,053 --> 00:27:00,370
He's the one true king.

349
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:03,423
He has the blood right to that throne.

350
00:27:03,543 --> 00:27:06,985
I sworn to stay clear of the politics
of the Seven Kingdoms.

351
00:27:07,105 --> 00:27:08,064
Have you now?

352
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,860
How does the Night's Watch vow go again?

353
00:27:14,709 --> 00:27:16,975
I bet you've got it memorized
since you got here.

354
00:27:19,615 --> 00:27:21,813
Night gathers and now my watch begins...

355
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:24,407
Not that bit, the bit at the end.

356
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,759
I'm the sword in the darkness,

357
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,673
the watcher on the walls,

358
00:27:29,793 --> 00:27:32,252
the shield that guards the realm of men.

359
00:27:32,372 --> 00:27:33,922
- I pledge my life...
- Okay, that's enough.

360
00:27:34,042 --> 00:27:36,347
Shield that guards the realm of men.

361
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,740
That's what you swore to be.

362
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,528
Now I'm not a learned man,

363
00:27:40,648 --> 00:27:43,008
the best way of helping the most people
might not be sitting

364
00:27:43,085 --> 00:27:45,252
in a frozen castle at
the edge of the world.

365
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:48,718
It just might mean wading in the muck
and getting your boots dirty

366
00:27:49,212 --> 00:27:51,150
and doing what needs to be done.

367
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,506
And what needs to be done?

368
00:27:52,626 --> 00:27:54,519
As long as the Boltons rule the North,

369
00:27:55,134 --> 00:27:56,572
the North will suffer.

370
00:27:57,947 --> 00:27:59,072
Just one man's opinion.

371
00:28:29,272 --> 00:28:30,172
What do you want?

372
00:28:31,247 --> 00:28:32,210
Who are you?

373
00:28:33,884 --> 00:28:34,784
What?

374
00:28:34,904 --> 00:28:37,724
You, who walk in here
with a coin you never earned,

375
00:28:37,844 --> 00:28:39,596
whose value you do not respect.

376
00:28:45,718 --> 00:28:46,968
Who are you?

377
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,791
No one. Ou! Cunt!

378
00:28:52,911 --> 00:28:54,742
A lie, a sad little lie.

379
00:28:54,862 --> 00:28:56,851
- Who are you?
- I told you, I'm no...

380
00:28:56,971 --> 00:28:59,078
Do that again and...

381
00:28:59,649 --> 00:29:00,686
Who are you?

382
00:29:01,612 --> 00:29:02,886
You're about to find out.

383
00:29:04,545 --> 00:29:05,745
What are you doing?

384
00:29:06,533 --> 00:29:07,495
We're only playing.

385
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:08,958
The game of faces.

386
00:29:09,383 --> 00:29:10,733
That girl is not ready.

387
00:29:10,853 --> 00:29:11,771
Clearly not.

388
00:29:12,121 --> 00:29:13,258
I am ready.

389
00:29:15,173 --> 00:29:16,061
For what?

390
00:29:16,348 --> 00:29:17,485
For every you want

391
00:29:17,605 --> 00:29:19,435
to be a Faceless Man.

392
00:29:19,555 --> 00:29:20,698
To be no one.

393
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:26,601
Whose sword is that?

394
00:29:27,277 --> 00:29:28,801
It belongs to Arya Stark.

395
00:29:29,114 --> 00:29:31,327
Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes,

396
00:29:31,447 --> 00:29:33,264
Arya Stark's stolen silver.

397
00:29:33,384 --> 00:29:34,977
A man wonders

398
00:29:35,555 --> 00:29:37,305
how is it that no one

399
00:29:37,425 --> 00:29:40,518
came to be surrounded
by Arya Stark's things?

400
00:33:45,176 --> 00:33:47,383
What do you do with them
after you wash them?

401
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,349
Open gates!

402
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:34,917
Hold up!

403
00:34:52,572 --> 00:34:56,082
Lady Sansa, welcome.

404
00:35:02,414 --> 00:35:03,749
Lord Bolton.

405
00:35:05,184 --> 00:35:09,877
May I introduce my son, Ramsay Bolton?

406
00:35:11,898 --> 00:35:13,348
It's an honor to meet you.

407
00:35:30,633 --> 00:35:32,586
I'll bring you a bowl of hot water.

408
00:35:33,209 --> 00:35:34,409
You must want to wash.

409
00:35:35,871 --> 00:35:36,547
Thank you.

410
00:35:40,272 --> 00:35:41,846
Welcome home, Lady Stark.

411
00:35:44,496 --> 00:35:45,884
The North remembers.

412
00:35:59,597 --> 00:36:00,459
Sam.

413
00:36:02,247 --> 00:36:03,147
Maester Aemon?

414
00:36:03,497 --> 00:36:05,421
He apologizes for not being here.

415
00:36:06,521 --> 00:36:07,771
He's not feeling well.

416
00:36:08,047 --> 00:36:09,209
Take good care of him.

417
00:36:09,991 --> 00:36:11,256
I will drink it then.

418
00:36:11,376 --> 00:36:12,256
He'll lose.

419
00:36:13,656 --> 00:36:15,269
As you all know too well,

420
00:36:15,389 --> 00:36:17,632
it's long past time to
dig a new latrine pit.

421
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,283
First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided
to appoint

422
00:36:24,403 --> 00:36:27,333
a latrine captain to
oversee this crucial task.

423
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:35,600
Brian.

424
00:36:36,588 --> 00:36:38,200
It seems like a good job for a ginger.

425
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,467
Ser Alliser.

426
00:36:51,477 --> 00:36:54,353
You have more experience
than any other ranger at Castle Black.

427
00:36:54,915 --> 00:36:57,190
You proved your valour many times over

428
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,527
by defending the Wall
from the wildling attack.

429
00:37:02,743 --> 00:37:04,343
I name you First Ranger.

430
00:37:11,543 --> 00:37:12,355
Lord Janos.

431
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,780
I'm giving you command of Greyguard.

432
00:37:16,705 --> 00:37:17,930
Greyguard is a ruin.

433
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:20,092
Yes, the fort is in a sorry state.

434
00:37:20,212 --> 00:37:21,955
Restore it as best you can.

435
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:23,440
First Builder Yarwyck can spare...

436
00:37:23,517 --> 00:37:25,702
I was charged with the defense of
King's Landing

437
00:37:25,822 --> 00:37:27,623
when you were soiling
your swaddling clothes.

438
00:37:27,732 --> 00:37:28,691
Keep your ruin.

439
00:37:32,257 --> 00:37:34,027
Alright, alright.

440
00:37:34,147 --> 00:37:35,334
Enough of that.

441
00:37:36,145 --> 00:37:37,756
You mistake me, my Lord.

442
00:37:39,582 --> 00:37:42,269
That was a command, not an offer.

443
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:45,482
Pack your arms and armour,
say your farewells,

444
00:37:46,482 --> 00:37:48,045
and ride for Greyguard.

445
00:37:50,994 --> 00:37:53,632
I will not go meekly off to freeze and die.

446
00:37:53,994 --> 00:37:56,632
Give it to one of the fools
who cast a stone for you.

447
00:37:57,006 --> 00:37:58,169
I will not have it.

448
00:37:58,289 --> 00:37:59,502
Did you hear me, boy?

449
00:37:59,622 --> 00:38:01,427
I will not have it!

450
00:38:01,665 --> 00:38:03,865
You refusing to obey my order?

451
00:38:09,798 --> 00:38:12,813
You can stick your order
up your bastard arse.

452
00:38:20,227 --> 00:38:21,743
Take Lord Janos outside.

453
00:38:24,305 --> 00:38:26,008
Ollie, bring me my sword.

454
00:38:48,301 --> 00:38:49,746
You cannot do this!

455
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:51,289
Get your hands off me!

456
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:53,750
You're scum! All of you!

457
00:38:58,035 --> 00:39:00,125
The boy thinks he can frighten me?

458
00:39:00,245 --> 00:39:02,312
He's mistaken, yes, very mistaken.

459
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:06,031
A disgrace!

460
00:39:06,907 --> 00:39:09,329
I have friends, important friends
in the capital!

461
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:10,579
You'll see!

462
00:39:46,366 --> 00:39:48,758
If you have any last words, my Lord...

463
00:39:49,686 --> 00:39:51,517
now is the time.

464
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,449
I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander!

465
00:39:56,569 --> 00:40:01,381
We all serve you. I'm sorry. Not only
for this, for all I've done and said.

466
00:40:02,955 --> 00:40:04,297
I was wrong!

467
00:40:05,591 --> 00:40:08,863
My Lord, please, mercy! Mercy!

468
00:40:09,302 --> 00:40:10,840
I'll go! I will!

469
00:40:11,207 --> 00:40:12,672
Please.

470
00:40:13,062 --> 00:40:15,406
I'm afraid.

471
00:40:16,065 --> 00:40:18,653
I've always been afraid.

472
00:41:02,369 --> 00:41:05,630
You have served us well, my son.

473
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,252
Thank you, Father!

474
00:41:07,372 --> 00:41:10,559
Which of the Seven will you worship today?

475
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:13,877
The Maiden...where is the Maiden?

476
00:41:14,912 --> 00:41:16,299
And the Stranger.

477
00:41:16,419 --> 00:41:19,326
- Two is extra, you realize...
- Yes, yes.

478
00:41:31,267 --> 00:41:32,224
What are you doing?

479
00:41:32,537 --> 00:41:35,349
This establishment belong to
Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't...

480
00:41:36,189 --> 00:41:38,298
You have profaned our Faith.

481
00:41:38,418 --> 00:41:41,215
The Faith of our fathers and forefathers.

482
00:41:41,335 --> 00:41:43,441
I am the High Septon of the...

483
00:41:43,561 --> 00:41:45,665
You are a sinner.

484
00:41:45,785 --> 00:41:47,515
And you shall be punished.

485
00:42:02,138 --> 00:42:04,038
Sinner! Sinner!

486
00:42:04,538 --> 00:42:06,226
Sinner! Repent!

487
00:42:06,346 --> 00:42:08,007
Sinner! Sinner!

488
00:42:08,127 --> 00:42:10,432
Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!

489
00:42:11,257 --> 00:42:13,507
Sinner! Shame on you!
Sinner!

490
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:15,382
Sinner!

491
00:42:25,904 --> 00:42:28,720
Your Grace, Grandmaester,
Lord Tyrell...

492
00:42:29,596 --> 00:42:31,620
Uh, it doesn't matter.

493
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,220
As the High Septon of
the Faith of the Seven

494
00:42:35,526 --> 00:42:37,163
I give voice to the will of the Gods

495
00:42:37,283 --> 00:42:39,763
and I am their foremost
servant in this world.

496
00:42:40,348 --> 00:42:43,548
An insult to me is an insult to the Gods.

497
00:42:43,601 --> 00:42:46,097
An assault on my person

498
00:42:46,217 --> 00:42:47,749
is an assault on our very religion.

499
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:48,737
You were assaulted?

500
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:49,524
I was.

501
00:42:49,644 --> 00:42:52,052
By those fanatics who
call themselves sparrows.

502
00:42:52,478 --> 00:42:53,718
And they humiliated me, they...

503
00:42:53,835 --> 00:42:57,034
they beat me, they left me naked
and bleeding on the cobblestones.

504
00:42:57,154 --> 00:42:58,784
I am lucky to be alive.

505
00:42:58,904 --> 00:43:01,869
I heard this all began in
Littlefinger's brothel.

506
00:43:03,098 --> 00:43:05,948
High Septon, this is a rather
shocking thing to hear.

507
00:43:06,068 --> 00:43:08,536
I tend to both the highest born
and the lowliest amongst us.

508
00:43:08,656 --> 00:43:10,952
Even prostitutes may earn
the mercy of the Mother.

509
00:43:11,072 --> 00:43:14,699
So you were administering to the
needs of these devout prostitutes?

510
00:43:14,987 --> 00:43:17,362
A man's private affairs
ought to stay private.

511
00:43:19,674 --> 00:43:21,312
What do you want from us, High Septon?

512
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,531
Justice!

513
00:43:23,081 --> 00:43:26,415
I ask that you protect our Faith
by arresting these criminals

514
00:43:26,535 --> 00:43:28,263
and throw them in the black cells.

515
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,247
I ask that you execute their leader,

516
00:43:30,503 --> 00:43:32,040
the so-called High Sparrow.

517
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,303
He's a threat to everything we hold sacred.

518
00:43:34,423 --> 00:43:37,043
- If he goes unpunished...
- And where do I find this man?

519
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:39,019
This High Sparrow?

520
00:43:49,339 --> 00:43:51,377
I don't think this is a
good idea, Your Grace.

521
00:43:51,497 --> 00:43:53,852
Nonsense, Ser Meryn.
These are deeply religious people.

522
00:43:54,412 --> 00:43:56,612
Where can I find the High Sparrow?

523
00:43:58,497 --> 00:44:01,513
Seven blessings...

524
00:44:11,976 --> 00:44:13,273
Thank the Gods.

525
00:44:13,393 --> 00:44:14,867
Just a little more.

526
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:19,789
Thank you for the soup.

527
00:44:23,235 --> 00:44:26,438
The young man said I would find the
High Sparrow back here. Where is he?

528
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:28,329
High Sparrow?

529
00:44:28,657 --> 00:44:30,376
Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?

530
00:44:30,496 --> 00:44:32,985
Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle.

531
00:44:33,892 --> 00:44:35,579
So, it's meant to...

532
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,908
We're often stuck with the
names our enemies give to us.

533
00:44:39,028 --> 00:44:42,408
The notion that we are all
equal in the eyes of Seven

534
00:44:42,528 --> 00:44:45,423
doesn't sit well with some
so they belittle me.

535
00:44:45,765 --> 00:44:49,062
- Seven blessings to you.
- Seven blessings to you, my dear.

536
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:53,250
It's only a name, quite
an easy burden to wear.

537
00:44:53,729 --> 00:44:55,636
Far easier than hers.

538
00:44:58,481 --> 00:44:59,692
Why no shoes?

539
00:45:00,024 --> 00:45:03,442
Because I gave them away to
someone who needed them more.

540
00:45:04,184 --> 00:45:05,630
We all do that.

541
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,732
It stops us from forgetting
who we really are.

542
00:45:09,229 --> 00:45:11,303
Is that why you came to King's Landing?

543
00:45:11,941 --> 00:45:13,116
To remind everyone?

544
00:45:13,236 --> 00:45:16,216
Everyone? I have a hard
time reminding myself.

545
00:45:16,838 --> 00:45:18,788
Well, I tell them no one's special.

546
00:45:18,908 --> 00:45:21,375
They think I'm special for telling them so.

547
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:24,453
Perhaps they're right.

548
00:45:25,609 --> 00:45:27,990
It would be comforting to
believe that, wouldn't it?

549
00:45:29,365 --> 00:45:31,915
The Gods sent you here to tempt me?

550
00:45:33,302 --> 00:45:34,252
I hope not.

551
00:45:35,727 --> 00:45:37,277
I'd assumed

552
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:39,814
you'd only come here to arrest me.

553
00:45:39,934 --> 00:45:42,364
For that incident with the High Septon.

554
00:45:42,484 --> 00:45:45,141
An unacceptable way to treat
the chosen representative

555
00:45:45,261 --> 00:45:47,702
of the Gods in this
world, wouldn't you say?

556
00:45:47,822 --> 00:45:49,635
Hypocrisy is a boil.

557
00:45:50,334 --> 00:45:52,684
Lancing a boil is never pleasant.

558
00:45:53,753 --> 00:45:56,894
Although, they could have been more careful
with the blade.

559
00:45:57,816 --> 00:46:00,269
The High Septon came to speak to me today.

560
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:04,980
He doesn't want me to arrest you,
he wants me to execute you.

561
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:10,228
I wouldn't presume to know
your thoughts on the matter.

562
00:46:14,526 --> 00:46:17,272
My thoughts on the matter
align with your own.

563
00:46:17,392 --> 00:46:21,484
The High Septon's behaviour was corosive,
as was his attitude.

564
00:46:21,604 --> 00:46:25,218
Having a man like that reside in the Sept
eats away the Faith from the inside.

565
00:46:26,787 --> 00:46:29,790
So now he resides in the Red
Keep's dungeons instead.

566
00:46:31,621 --> 00:46:35,245
The Faith and the Crown are the two
pillars that hold up this world.

567
00:46:35,365 --> 00:46:36,805
If one collapses, so does the other.

568
00:46:38,397 --> 00:46:41,327
You must do everything necessary

569
00:46:41,447 --> 00:46:42,761
to protect one another.

570
00:47:01,658 --> 00:47:02,670
Your Grace.

571
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:05,195
Send a message to Littlefinger

572
00:47:05,315 --> 00:47:07,833
in the Eyrie or wherever
he's slythering about.

573
00:47:10,478 --> 00:47:12,645
At once, Your Grace.

574
00:47:13,346 --> 00:47:15,768
- How's your work coming along?
- Very well.

575
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:19,459
- You've made progress?
- More than I've expected.

576
00:47:20,008 --> 00:47:21,297
Still a way to go, but...

577
00:47:21,785 --> 00:47:23,836
Very good. I'll leave you to it then.

578
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:28,172
Make sure Littlefinger is clear on
the meaning of the word "immediate".

579
00:47:44,983 --> 00:47:46,087
Shh...

580
00:47:47,885 --> 00:47:49,248
Easy, friend.

581
00:47:51,696 --> 00:47:53,333
Come on, children.

582
00:48:13,136 --> 00:48:14,711
She really is lovely.

583
00:48:16,236 --> 00:48:17,611
I hope I can make her happy.

584
00:48:18,011 --> 00:48:19,373
I hope so too.

585
00:48:20,007 --> 00:48:23,395
I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa
during our travels together.

586
00:48:24,144 --> 00:48:25,731
She suffered enough.

587
00:48:26,464 --> 00:48:27,758
I'll never hurt her.

588
00:48:28,392 --> 00:48:29,589
You have my word.

589
00:48:32,283 --> 00:48:34,114
I've heard very little about you.

590
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,362
Which makes you quite a rare thing,
as lords go.

591
00:48:39,266 --> 00:48:41,097
I haven't been a lord very long.

592
00:48:41,951 --> 00:48:44,881
- I was a bastard.
- And you're not anymore.

593
00:48:46,688 --> 00:48:48,592
Allow me a moment alone with
Lord Baelish.

594
00:48:48,712 --> 00:48:52,327
Yes, father.
And thank you, Lord Baelish.

595
00:48:52,447 --> 00:48:54,337
I'm forever in your debt.

596
00:49:00,342 --> 00:49:01,924
He seems pleased.

597
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,721
Shouldn't he be?

598
00:49:05,029 --> 00:49:06,805
I assure you she's still a virgin.

599
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:11,379
Tyrion never consumated the marriage. By
the law of the land, she's no man's wife.

600
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:14,223
Inspect her, if you must.

601
00:49:14,343 --> 00:49:15,823
I leave that to the brothel keeper.

602
00:49:16,073 --> 00:49:18,301
It's her name I need, not her virtue.

603
00:49:18,421 --> 00:49:20,511
I have delivered everything I've promised.

604
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:23,916
And you prepared for the consequences.

605
00:49:24,241 --> 00:49:26,754
When the Lannisters hear I've
wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.

606
00:49:26,874 --> 00:49:29,381
The Lannister name doesn't
mean what it once did.

607
00:49:29,665 --> 00:49:30,865
Tywin is dead.

608
00:49:30,985 --> 00:49:33,727
He kept his house in power
through sheer will.

609
00:49:33,847 --> 00:49:35,121
Without him,

610
00:49:35,396 --> 00:49:37,684
Jaime has one hand and no allies,

611
00:49:37,978 --> 00:49:39,502
Tommen is a soft boy,

612
00:49:39,778 --> 00:49:41,752
not a king to fear.

613
00:49:42,353 --> 00:49:43,803
The Queen will be enraged.

614
00:49:43,923 --> 00:49:46,390
Queen Margaery adores Sansa.

615
00:49:47,011 --> 00:49:48,536
Cersei is Queen Mother,

616
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:51,461
a title whose importance
wanes with each passing day.

617
00:49:51,693 --> 00:49:53,193
You noticed, still as friends

618
00:49:53,313 --> 00:49:56,123
men in important places,
whom she can ask for favours.

619
00:49:57,062 --> 00:50:00,109
A message for you,
from Cersei Lannister.

620
00:50:00,953 --> 00:50:03,969
A rider arrived from Eyrie,
shortly before dawn.

621
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:06,423
Apparently, she thinks
you're still in the Vale.

622
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:08,840
A message for me, you say.

623
00:50:09,659 --> 00:50:11,346
Strange that the seal is broken.

624
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:13,466
I'm sure you understand my
position, Lord Baelish.

625
00:50:13,824 --> 00:50:16,337
If you received word in the night
from the Queen Mother,

626
00:50:16,787 --> 00:50:19,131
it does make me question our new alliance.

627
00:50:20,413 --> 00:50:23,006
Lannisters made you one of
the great lords of Westeros.

628
00:50:23,821 --> 00:50:25,809
Yet, here you are in the North,
undermining them.

629
00:50:26,753 --> 00:50:28,456
Why gamble with your position?

630
00:50:30,179 --> 00:50:31,929
Every ambitious move is a gamble.

631
00:50:33,088 --> 00:50:35,825
You gambled when you drove a dagger
into Robb Stark's heart.

632
00:50:38,412 --> 00:50:40,575
It appears that your gamble paid off.

633
00:50:40,695 --> 00:50:42,125
You're Warden of the North.

634
00:50:42,245 --> 00:50:43,860
I had Tywin Lannister backing.

635
00:50:44,372 --> 00:50:46,484
Who supports me now? You?

636
00:50:47,184 --> 00:50:48,772
The Eyrie is mine.

637
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:53,378
The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed
an alliance with the lords of the North,

638
00:50:53,959 --> 00:50:56,846
they brought down the greatest dynasty
this world has ever known.

639
00:51:00,633 --> 00:51:02,305
I'd like to borrow one of your birds.

640
00:51:02,832 --> 00:51:04,441
Cersei will expect a reply.

641
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,097
I'd like to read the reply.

642
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:31,790
I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

643
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:33,340
Volantis is a large city.

644
00:51:33,546 --> 00:51:35,527
I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

645
00:51:35,553 --> 00:51:37,543
The likelihood of you being spotted here

646
00:51:37,572 --> 00:51:39,081
increases a hundred fold.

647
00:51:39,776 --> 00:51:41,626
I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

648
00:51:41,901 --> 00:51:44,463
I'm not sure how many new ways
I can find of saying this.

649
00:51:47,494 --> 00:51:51,355
I will not be of any use
to Daenerys Targaryen

650
00:51:51,649 --> 00:51:53,462
if I lose my mind.

651
00:51:53,582 --> 00:51:56,870
I can't remember the last
face I saw that wasn't yours.

652
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,796
It's a perfectly good face.

653
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:00,432
I'm losing my mind.

654
00:52:00,552 --> 00:52:02,695
If anyone recognizes you,
you'll lose more than...

655
00:52:02,815 --> 00:52:06,095
Look, we are thousands
of miles from Westeros.

656
00:52:08,978 --> 00:52:09,940
What am I?

657
00:52:10,852 --> 00:52:12,352
One more drunk dwarf.

658
00:52:42,455 --> 00:52:44,310
We have to go now. Come on.

659
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:45,892
Hold it, hold it!

660
00:52:49,526 --> 00:52:51,528
- Slaves.
- Yes.

661
00:52:52,138 --> 00:52:54,995
The Volantene masters are very organized.

662
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:58,120
Flies for dung shovelers.

663
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,238
Hammers for builders.

664
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,850
Tears for whores.

665
00:53:03,339 --> 00:53:05,389
Lest they forget.

666
00:53:09,593 --> 00:53:14,866
_

667
00:53:15,562 --> 00:53:19,006
_

668
00:53:19,126 --> 00:53:21,409
We should keep moving.

669
00:53:28,898 --> 00:53:31,086
_

670
00:53:31,748 --> 00:53:33,536
_

671
00:53:33,656 --> 00:53:35,948
_

672
00:53:36,068 --> 00:53:39,254
The only red priest we had in
King's Landing was Thoros of Myr.

673
00:53:40,123 --> 00:53:41,499
This one's much better looking.

674
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:43,386
_

675
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:47,127
_

676
00:53:47,247 --> 00:53:49,508
_

677
00:53:49,628 --> 00:53:51,008
Stone men.

678
00:53:51,302 --> 00:53:54,452
Good luck stopping this spread
of grayscale with prayer.

679
00:53:54,572 --> 00:53:56,814
You'd have better luck
dancing away the plague.

680
00:53:56,934 --> 00:53:58,764
_

681
00:53:58,884 --> 00:54:03,447
_

682
00:54:03,915 --> 00:54:06,303
_

683
00:54:07,097 --> 00:54:09,009
We're going to meet the Saviour.

684
00:54:09,334 --> 00:54:10,859
You should have told me.

685
00:54:10,979 --> 00:54:12,459
Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?

686
00:54:28,644 --> 00:54:30,156
Come on.

687
00:54:31,218 --> 00:54:32,668
Let's find a brothel.

688
00:54:53,472 --> 00:54:56,738
_

689
00:54:56,858 --> 00:54:59,629
It's even better luck
to suck a dwarf's cock.

690
00:55:03,879 --> 00:55:06,567
See? We blend right in.

691
00:55:06,957 --> 00:55:10,270
Just two more travellers, mad with lust.

692
00:55:15,357 --> 00:55:16,626
Thank you.

693
00:55:25,557 --> 00:55:28,193
Curious hair.

694
00:55:29,385 --> 00:55:31,182
The Mother of Dragons.

695
00:55:33,891 --> 00:55:36,782
It appears you're not the
only Targaryen supporter.

696
00:55:47,717 --> 00:55:52,092
Someone who inspires priests and
whores is worth taking seriously.

697
00:55:52,212 --> 00:55:53,691
What makes you worth that much?

698
00:55:53,811 --> 00:55:55,081
The magic.

699
00:55:58,852 --> 00:56:01,802
Well, she's taken.

700
00:56:03,013 --> 00:56:04,712
Where're you going?

701
00:56:04,832 --> 00:56:07,270
I need to speak to someone with hair.

702
00:56:09,446 --> 00:56:10,915
- Hello?
- Hello.

703
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:13,775
- You've got no drink.
- You've got no money.

704
00:56:14,218 --> 00:56:15,931
Do I look like a man without money?

705
00:56:18,012 --> 00:56:19,536
Never trust looks.

706
00:56:19,826 --> 00:56:23,001
Until quite recently, I was one
of the richest men in the world.

707
00:56:24,663 --> 00:56:27,691
But who needs wealth when
you can make a woman laugh?

708
00:56:29,877 --> 00:56:33,920
I always pay my debts,
I'm well known for it.

709
00:56:38,614 --> 00:56:40,059
You like her?

710
00:56:40,899 --> 00:56:42,891
They all like her.

711
00:56:43,011 --> 00:56:45,010
They all want to fuck a queen.

712
00:56:45,291 --> 00:56:47,651
- Because they never met a queen.
- You're just saying that.

713
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:49,541
You know how to spot a liar.

714
00:56:50,361 --> 00:56:51,923
If I could pick any girl here,

715
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:54,017
I would pick you.

716
00:56:55,265 --> 00:56:56,456
Why?

717
00:56:57,355 --> 00:56:59,288
Because you have a skeptical mind.

718
00:57:03,916 --> 00:57:07,432
Alright, then. I'm warning you.
You're gonna have to wash you first.

719
00:57:08,409 --> 00:57:09,922
Come on.

720
00:57:17,388 --> 00:57:20,465
I'm...I'm sorry, I can't.

721
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:22,955
Of course you can.

722
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:24,835
You're shy.

723
00:57:25,274 --> 00:57:26,471
I'm not.

724
00:57:28,302 --> 00:57:29,474
Have another drink.

725
00:57:29,594 --> 00:57:32,135
Gladly, but this, I can't do.

726
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:35,089
Believe me, no one is
more shocked than I am.

727
00:57:35,607 --> 00:57:37,457
I hope it passes.

728
00:57:38,416 --> 00:57:40,467
What will I do in my spare time?

729
00:57:43,163 --> 00:57:46,361
Go for a piss, let it stopped

730
00:58:04,711 --> 00:58:08,056
No need to worry, I was just...
Oh...

731
00:58:09,326 --> 00:58:11,425
I thought you were someone else.

732
00:58:11,545 --> 00:58:13,696
Show is almost over.

733
00:58:14,013 --> 00:58:16,650
I'm sure the girls inside
will be happy to oblige.

734
00:58:18,457 --> 00:58:22,012
You made some kind of mistake. Why don't you
tell me what you think you are doing and...

735
00:58:24,162 --> 00:58:25,824
I'm taking you to the Queen.

736
00:58:30,288 --> 00:58:40,349
