00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,860
would be skewered
on the city gates by now.

167
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:47,399
Whatever Jon Arryn knew or
didn't know, it died with him.

168
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:51,236
And Robert will choose a new Hand
of the King... someone to do his job

169
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,172
while he's off fucking boars
and hunting whores...

170
00:19:54,207 --> 00:19:57,175
Or is it the other way around?

171
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,611
And life will go on.

172
00:19:59,645 --> 00:20:02,214
You should be
the Hand of the King.

173
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:05,083
That's an honor
I can do without.

174
00:20:05,118 --> 00:20:07,252
Their days are too long,

175
00:20:07,286 --> 00:20:09,554
their lives are too short.

176
00:20:13,258 --> 00:20:15,926
<i>( Thunder rumbles )</i>

<i>( Birds chirping )</i>

179
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:49,528
All these years

180
00:20:49,563 --> 00:20:51,230
and I still feel like an outsider

181
00:20:51,264 --> 00:20:53,499
when I come here.

182
00:20:53,534 --> 00:20:56,069
You have five northern children.

183
00:20:56,103 --> 00:20:59,338
You're not an outsider.

184
00:20:59,373 --> 00:21:02,308
I wonder if the old gods agree.

185
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,312
It's your gods with all the rules.

186
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:14,388
I am so sorry, my love.

187
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:19,327
- Tell me.
- There was a raven from King's Landing.

188
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,898
Jon Arryn is dead.

189
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:25,601
<i>A fever took him.</i>

190
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:30,673
<i>I know he was like</i>
<i>a father to you.</i>

191
00:21:33,476 --> 00:21:36,745
- <i>Your sister, the boy?</i>
- They both have their health,

192
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:38,947
<i>gods be good.</i>

193
00:21:48,691 --> 00:21:51,593
The raven brought more news...

194
00:21:52,829 --> 00:21:54,930
The king rides
for Winterfell...

195
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:56,665
With the queen

196
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,834
<i>and all the rest of them.</i>

197
00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:02,138
If he's coming
this far north...

198
00:22:03,508 --> 00:22:05,709
There's only one thing he's after.

199
00:22:05,743 --> 00:22:08,779
You can always say no, Ned.

200
00:22:17,489 --> 00:22:21,226
Catelyn: We'll need plenty of
candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber.

201
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,194
I'm told he reads all night.

202
00:22:23,229 --> 00:22:25,130
I'm told he drinks all night.

203
00:22:25,164 --> 00:22:28,467
How much could he possibly drink?
A man of his...

204
00:22:28,501 --> 00:22:30,268
Stature?

205
00:22:30,303 --> 00:22:32,972
We've brought up eight barrels
of ale from the cellar.

206
00:22:33,006 --> 00:22:35,541
- Perhaps we'll find out.
- In any case,

207
00:22:35,575 --> 00:22:38,244
<i>candles.</i>

208
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,419
Why is your mother so dead set on
us getting pretty for the king?

209
00:22:45,453 --> 00:22:48,288
It's for the queen, I bet.
I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.

210
00:22:48,323 --> 00:22:50,424
I hear the prince
is a right royal prick.

211
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,492
Think of all those southern
girls he gets to stab

212
00:22:52,527 --> 00:22:54,094
with his right royal prick.

213
00:22:55,862 --> 00:22:57,997
Go on, Tommy, shear him good.

214
00:22:58,031 --> 00:23:00,500
He's never met a girl he likes
better than his own hair.

215
00:23:00,534 --> 00:23:02,635
<i>( Laughter )</i>

Brandon!

218
00:23:44,144 --> 00:23:47,480
I saw the king.
He's got hundreds of people.

219
00:23:47,514 --> 00:23:50,717
How many times have I
told you no climbing?

220
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:53,619
But he's coming right
now... down our road.

221
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,028
I want you to promise me,

222
00:24:03,063 --> 00:24:04,830
no more climbing.

223
00:24:09,235 --> 00:24:10,836
I promise.

224
00:24:13,106 --> 00:24:16,076
- Do you know what?
- What?

225
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,411
You always look
at your feet before you lie.

226

( Chuckles )

227
00:24:21,082 --> 00:24:24,451
Run and find your father.
Tell him the king is close.

228
00:25:08,564 --> 00:25:12,267
Where's Arya?
Sansa, where's your sister?

229

- Hey hey hey hey.
- Ohh.

230
00:25:24,047 --> 00:25:26,348
What are you doing
with that on?

231
00:25:29,151 --> 00:25:31,287
- Go on.

232
00:25:32,589 --> 00:25:34,390

- Cat!
- Your Grace.

238
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:25,498
Nine years... Why haven't I seen you?
Where the hell have you been?

239
00:27:25,532 --> 00:27:27,433
Guarding the north
for you, Your Grace.

240

<i>Winterfell is yours.</i>

- Where's the Imp?
- Will you shut up?

242
00:27:35,744 --> 00:27:38,446
Robert: Who have we here?

243
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,248
You must be Robb.

244
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:46,555
My, you're a pretty one.

245
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,557
Your name is?

246
00:27:48,591 --> 00:27:51,159
Arya.

247
00:27:51,194 --> 00:27:54,230
Oh, show us your muscles.

248
00:27:55,999 --> 00:27:57,500
You'll be a soldier.

249
00:28:00,104 --> 00:28:02,906
Arya: <i>That's Jaime Lannister,</i>
<i>the queen's twin brother.</i>

251
00:28:14,585 --> 00:28:16,786
My queen.

252

My queen.

253
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,691
Take me to your crypt.
I want to pay my respects.

254

We've been riding
for a month, my love.

255

Surely the dead can wait.

Ned.

00:28:35,873 --> 00:28:37,674
Where's the Imp?

Where is our brother?

00:28:43,112 --> 00:28:45,313
Go and find the little beast.

260
00:28:47,417 --> 00:28:49,851
Tell me about Jon Arryn.

261
00:28:49,885 --> 00:28:52,520
One minute he was fine and then...

262
00:28:53,756 --> 00:28:56,491
Burned right through him,
whatever it was.

263
00:28:57,693 --> 00:28:59,628
I loved that man.

264

We both did.

Robert: He never had to
teach you much, but me?

266
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,534
You remember me at 16?

267
00:29:05,568 --> 00:29:07,503
- ( Chuckles )
- All I wanted to do

268
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,172
was crack skulls and fuck girls.

269
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:13,108
- He showed me what was what.
- Aye.

270
00:29:13,142 --> 00:29:16,478
Don't look at me like that.
It's not his fault I didn't listen.

271
00:29:20,417 --> 00:29:22,751
I need you, Ned...

272
00:29:22,786 --> 00:29:26,689
down at King's Landing, not up here
where you're no damn use to anybody.

273
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:31,093
Lord Eddard Stark,

274
00:29:31,128 --> 00:29:33,729
I would name you
the Hand of the King.

275
00:29:38,168 --> 00:29:40,236
I'm not worthy of the honor.

276
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:44,007
I'm not trying to honor you.
I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom

277
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:47,577
while I eat, drink and whore
my way to an early grave.

278
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:49,712
Damn it, Ned, stand up.

279
00:29:50,981 --> 00:29:53,150
You helped me win
the Iron Throne,

280
00:29:53,184 --> 00:29:55,285
now help me
keep the damn thing.

281
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,321
We were meant to rule together.

282
00:29:58,355 --> 00:30:02,424
If your sister had lived,
we'd have been bound by blood.

283
00:30:02,459 --> 00:30:04,827
Well, it's not too late.

284
00:30:06,229 --> 00:30:08,164
I have a son,
you have a daughter.

285
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,734
We'll join our houses.

286

Did you hear the king's
in Winterfell?

291
00:30:50,209 --> 00:30:52,144
I did hear something about that.

292
00:30:52,178 --> 00:30:54,445
And the queen
and her twin brother.

293
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,615
They say that <i>he</i> is the most
handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.

294
00:30:57,649 --> 00:30:59,783
And the other brother?

295
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:02,853
- The queen has two brothers?
- There's the pretty one,

296
00:31:02,887 --> 00:31:05,889
and there's the clever one.

297
00:31:07,758 --> 00:31:10,794
Mmm, I hear they
call him the Imp.

298
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:12,896
I hear he hates that nickname.

299
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:16,166
Oh? I hear he's more
than earned it.

300
00:31:16,201 --> 00:31:18,969
I hear he's a drunken
little lecher,

301
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:21,439
prone to all manner
of perversions.

302
00:31:21,473 --> 00:31:23,374
Clever girl.

303

We've been expecting you,
Lord Tyrion.

304

Have you?

305
00:31:30,248 --> 00:31:32,116
- Oh!
- Already?

306
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:36,988
The gods gave me one blessing.

( Door opens )

308
00:31:41,793 --> 00:31:44,395
- Don't get up.
- My lord.

309
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:46,764
Should I explain to you
the meaning of a closed door

310
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:50,535
- in a whorehouse, brother?
- You have much to teach me, no doubt,

311
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:54,205
but our sister craves
your attention.

312
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:56,341
She has odd cravings,
our sister.

313
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:58,509
A family trait.

314
00:31:58,544 --> 00:32:01,412
Now the Starks are
feasting us at sundown.

<i>I'm sorry, I've begun</i>
<i>the feast a bit early.</i>

And this is the first
of many courses.

318
00:32:09,488 --> 00:32:11,690
I thought you might say that.

319
00:32:11,724 --> 00:32:14,125
But since we're short on time...

320
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,060
Come on, girls.

322
00:32:21,132 --> 00:32:23,434
See you at sundown.

Tyrion: <i>Close the door!</i>

324
00:32:38,184 --> 00:32:41,186
Did you have to bury her

This is where she belongs.

329

She belonged with me.

In my dreams,
I kill him every night.

It's done, Your Grace.

332

Daenerys.

337

There's our bride-to-be.

338
00:33:35,642 --> 00:33:38,777
Look, a gift from Illyrio.

339
00:33:39,846 --> 00:33:41,613
Touch it.

340
00:33:41,648 --> 00:33:43,849
Go on, feel the fabric.

341
00:33:48,488 --> 00:33:50,655
Mmm.

342
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:54,626
Isn't he a gracious host?

343
00:33:56,796 --> 00:33:58,831
We've been his guests
for over a year

344
00:33:58,865 --> 00:34:00,833
and he's never
asked us for anything.

345
00:34:00,867 --> 00:34:02,602
Illyrio's no fool.

346
00:34:02,636 --> 00:34:04,971
He knows I won't
forget my friends

Let them see.

350
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:25,422
You have a woman's body now.

( Sighs )

352
00:34:42,973 --> 00:34:45,942
I need you to be perfect today.

353
00:34:47,344 --> 00:34:49,245
Can you do that for me?

354
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:55,352
You don't want to wake
the dragon, do you?

355
00:34:56,789 --> 00:34:58,389
No.

356
00:35:05,331 --> 00:35:08,400
When they write the history
of my reign, sweet sister,

357
00:35:08,434 --> 00:35:10,668
they will say it began today.

358
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:36,060
It's too hot, my lady.

359

Where is he?

361
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:01,717
The Dothraki are not known
for their punctuality.

( Illyrio speaking Dothraki )
Athchomar chomakaan, Khal vezhven.

<i>Viserys of House Targaryen,</i>

00:36:37,257 --> 00:36:39,725
Do you see
how long his hair is?

371

<i>When Dothraki are</i>
<i>defeated in combat,</i>

<i>they cut off their braids so the whole
world can see their shame.</i>

373
00:36:46,465 --> 00:36:50,434
Khal Drogo has
never been defeated.

374
00:36:51,636 --> 00:36:53,437
He's a savage, of course,

375
00:36:53,471 --> 00:36:55,806
<i>but one of the finest killers alive.</i>

376
00:36:57,075 --> 00:36:59,209
And you will be his queen.

377
00:36:59,243 --> 00:37:01,878
Come forward, my dear.

378
00:37:41,952 --> 00:37:43,620
Where is he going?!

379
00:37:43,654 --> 00:37:46,189
- The ceremony is over.
- But he didn't say anything.

380
00:37:46,224 --> 00:37:48,658
- Did he like her?
- Trust me, Your Grace,

381
00:37:48,693 --> 00:37:51,194
if he didn't like her,
we'd know.

382
00:37:54,198 --> 00:37:56,466
It won't be long now.

383
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,401
Soon you will cross
the Narrow Sea

384
00:37:58,435 --> 00:38:00,870
and take back your father's throne.

385

387
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,909
They cry out
for their true king.

388
00:38:11,514 --> 00:38:13,382
When will they be married?

389
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:16,953
Soon. The Dothraki never
stay still for long.

390
00:38:16,987 --> 00:38:19,522
Is it true they lie
with their horses?

391
00:38:19,557 --> 00:38:22,626
I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.

392
00:38:22,661 --> 00:38:24,528
Do you take me for a fool?

393
00:38:24,562 --> 00:38:26,397
I take you for a king.

394
00:38:26,431 --> 00:38:29,634
Kings lack the caution
of common men.

395
00:38:29,668 --> 00:38:32,036
My apologies if
I've given offense.

396
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:34,439
I know how to play
a man like Drogo.

397
00:38:34,473 --> 00:38:37,375
I give him a queen
and he gives me an army.

398
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:40,279
I don't want to be his queen.

399
00:38:44,652 --> 00:38:46,754
I want to go home.

400
00:38:47,655 --> 00:38:49,122
So do I.

401
00:38:49,157 --> 00:38:52,292
I want us both to go home,

402
00:38:52,327 --> 00:38:54,627
but they took it from us.

403
00:38:54,662 --> 00:38:56,429
So tell me, sweet sister,

404
00:38:56,464 --> 00:38:58,665
how do we go home?

405
00:39:00,501 --> 00:39:02,068
I don't know.

406
00:39:02,103 --> 00:39:05,105
We go home with an army.

407
00:39:06,741 --> 00:39:09,943
With Khal Drogo's army.

408
00:39:09,978 --> 00:39:12,980
I would let his whole tribe fuck you...

409
00:39:13,014 --> 00:39:16,217
All 40,000 men
and their horses too

410
00:39:16,251 --> 00:39:18,119
if that's what it took.

411
00:39:24,593 --> 00:39:26,827
( Kisses )

412
00:39:35,235 --> 00:39:37,670
Do you think Joffrey will like me?

413
00:39:37,704 --> 00:39:40,239
What if he thinks I'm ugly?

414
00:39:40,274 --> 00:39:43,944
Then he is the stupidest
prince that ever lived.

415
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,848
He's so handsome.

416
00:39:48,883 --> 00:39:51,584
When would we be married?
Soon? Or do we have to wait?

417
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:54,721
Hush now.
Your father hasn't even said yes.

418
00:39:54,755 --> 00:39:56,589
Why would he say no?

419
00:39:56,624 --> 00:39:59,893
He'd be the second most
powerful man in the kingdoms.

420
00:39:59,927 --> 00:40:02,495
He'd have to leave home.

421
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:05,465
He'd have to leave me.

422
00:40:05,499 --> 00:40:08,502
And so would you.

423
00:40:08,536 --> 00:40:11,137
You left your home
to come here.

424
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:13,973
And I'd be queen someday.

425
00:40:15,042 --> 00:40:16,610
Please make father say yes!

426
00:40:16,644 --> 00:40:18,511
- Sansa...
- Please please!

427
00:40:18,545 --> 00:40:21,481
It's the only thing
I ever wanted.

You got bigger.

436
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,503
Rode all day. Didn't want to leave
you alone with the Lannisters.

437
00:41:15,537 --> 00:41:17,472
Why aren't you at the feast?

438
00:41:17,507 --> 00:41:20,542
Lady Stark thought it might
insult the royal family

439
00:41:20,577 --> 00:41:22,778
to seat a bastard
in their midst.

440

Well, you're always
welcome on the wall.

No bastard was ever
refused a seat there.

I know he will.

We have no families.

- None of us will ever father sons...
- I don't care about that!

My greatest accomplishment.

And you... you're Ned Stark's
bastard, aren't you?

Did I offend you?
Sorry.

<i>Lord Eddard Stark is my father.</i>

And Lady Stark
is not your mother,

468
00:43:00,541 --> 00:43:02,809
making you the bastard.

469
00:43:05,012 --> 00:43:07,814
Let me give you
some advice, bastard.

470
00:43:08,982 --> 00:43:10,783
Never forget what you are.

471
00:43:10,818 --> 00:43:12,752
The rest of the world will not.

472
00:43:12,786 --> 00:43:15,355
Wear it like armor

473
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,925
and it can never
be used to hurt you.

474
00:43:19,561 --> 00:43:22,564
What the hell do you know
about being a bastard?

475
00:43:23,866 --> 00:43:27,269
All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes.

( Music playing, chattering )

You at a feast...
It's like a bear in a trap.

478
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,299
The boy I beheaded...

- Did you know him?
- Of course I did.

480
00:43:59,936 --> 00:44:02,038
Just a lad.

481
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:03,806
And he was tough, Ned,

00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,608
a true ranger.

483
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:09,112
Pfft.
He was talking madness.

Hmph.
A wildling ambush.

487
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,624
Maybe.

488
00:44:21,658 --> 00:44:25,194
Direwolves south of the wall,

489
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,730
talk of the walkers,

490
00:44:27,764 --> 00:44:30,366
and my brother might be
the next Hand of the King.

491
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,669
Winter <i>is</i> coming.

492
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,072
Winter is coming.

493
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:38,574
( Chuckles )

494
00:44:38,608 --> 00:44:41,543
- Uncle Benjen.
- Robb boy.

495
00:44:41,577 --> 00:44:43,178
- How are you?
- I'm good.

496
00:44:43,212 --> 00:44:45,580
( Laughter )

497
00:44:46,883 --> 00:44:49,117
Is this your first time
in the north, Your Grace?

498
00:44:49,152 --> 00:44:52,288
Yes.
Lovely country.

499
00:44:55,994 --> 00:44:59,396
I'm sure it's very grim
after King's Landing.

500
00:45:00,666 --> 00:45:02,767
I remember how scared I was
when Ned brought me

501
00:45:02,801 --> 00:45:05,036
up here for the first time.

502
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:08,906
Hello, little dove.

503
00:45:10,108 --> 00:45:12,276
But you are a beauty.

504
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:14,411
- How old are you?
- 13, Your Grace.

505
00:45:14,446 --> 00:45:17,180
You're tall.
Still growing?

506
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:19,115
I think so, Your Grace.

507
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,384
And have you bled yet?

508
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:27,956
No, Your Grace.

509
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:31,494
Your dress, did you make it?

510
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:36,132
Such a talent.
You must make something for me.

511
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:41,004
I hear we might share
a grandchild someday.

512
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:43,274
I hear the same.

513
00:45:43,308 --> 00:45:45,376
Your daughter will
do well in the Capital.

514
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:49,114
Such a beauty shouldn't stay
hidden up here forever.

515
00:46:05,198 --> 00:46:08,501
- Your pardon.
- I hear we might be neighbors soon.

516
00:46:08,535 --> 00:46:10,202
- I hope it's true.
- Yes,

517
00:46:10,237 --> 00:46:12,104
the king has honored me
with his offer.

518
00:46:12,138 --> 00:46:13,639
I'm sure we'll have
a tournament

519
00:46:13,674 --> 00:46:15,641
to celebrate your new
title... if you accept.

520
00:46:15,676 --> 00:46:17,878
It would be good
to have you on the field.

521
00:46:17,912 --> 00:46:20,080
The competition
has become a bit stale.

522
00:46:20,114 --> 00:46:22,850
- I don't fight in tournaments.
- No?

523
00:46:22,884 --> 00:46:24,385
Getting a little old for it?

524
00:46:24,419 --> 00:46:28,056
( Chuckles )
I don't fight in tournaments

525
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:30,591
because when I fight
a man for real

526
00:46:30,626 --> 00:46:32,860
I don't want him to know
what I can do.

527
00:46:34,696 --> 00:46:36,496
Well said.

528
00:46:37,531 --> 00:46:40,466
- ( Men laughing )
- Arya!

529
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,102
It's not funny!

530
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:45,871
<i>She always does this.</i>

531
00:46:45,905 --> 00:46:47,773
<i>This was my favorite dress.</i>

532
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:51,076
She always does it
and it's not funny!

533
00:46:51,111 --> 00:46:53,045
Robb: Time for bed.

534
00:46:54,515 --> 00:46:56,149
( Groans )

535
00:47:03,992 --> 00:47:07,061
Ned: I'm a Northman.

536
00:47:07,095 --> 00:47:09,497
I belong here with you,
not down south

537
00:47:09,531 --> 00:47:12,033
in that rats' nest they call a Capital.

538
00:47:13,068 --> 00:47:15,802
I <i>won't</i> let him take you.

539
00:47:17,271 --> 00:47:19,739
The king takes what he wants.

540
00:47:19,773 --> 00:47:22,341
( Huffs )
That's why he's king.

541
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:27,245
I'll say,
"Listen, fat man."

542
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,613
( Laughs )

543
00:47:28,647 --> 00:47:31,149
"You are not taking
my husband anywhere.

544
00:47:31,183 --> 00:47:33,585
He belongs to me now."

545
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:39,291
How did he get so fat?

546
00:47:39,325 --> 00:47:42,160
He only stops eating when
it's time for a drink.

547
00:47:43,596 --> 00:47:44,996
<i>( Knocks )</i>

548
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,799
Man: <i>It's Maester Luwin, my lord.</i>

549
00:47:49,302 --> 00:47:51,704
Send him in.

550
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,708
Pardon, my lord, my lady.

551
00:47:55,743 --> 00:47:58,578
A rider in the night...

552
00:47:58,612 --> 00:48:00,714
From your sister.

553
00:48:08,389 --> 00:48:11,058
- Stay.
- This was sent from the Eyrie.

554
00:48:11,092 --> 00:48:13,627
( Door closes )

555
00:48:16,931 --> 00:48:19,299
What's she doing at the Eyrie?

556
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:21,968
She hasn't been back there
since her wedding.

557
00:48:30,478 --> 00:48:32,446
What news?

558
00:48:33,782 --> 00:48:36,551
<i>She's fled the Capital.</i>

559
00:48:38,687 --> 00:48:41,356
She says Jon Arryn was murdered.

560
00:48:41,391 --> 00:48:43,359
By the Lannisters.

561
00:48:43,393 --> 00:48:46,162
She says the king is in danger.

562
00:48:46,196 --> 00:48:48,465
She's fresh widowed, Cat.

563
00:48:48,499 --> 00:48:50,500
She doesn't know what she's saying.

564
00:48:50,534 --> 00:48:53,036
Lysa's head would be
on a spike right now

565
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:55,238
if the wrong people
had found that letter.

566
00:48:55,272 --> 00:48:57,974
Do you think she would risk her life...

567
00:48:58,008 --> 00:48:59,642
her son's life...

568
00:48:59,676 --> 00:49:03,146
if she wasn't certain
her husband was murdered?

569
00:49:10,289 --> 00:49:12,189
If this news is true

570
00:49:12,223 --> 00:49:15,226
and the Lannisters conspire
against the Throne,

571
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:18,562
who but you can
protect the king?

572
00:49:18,597 --> 00:49:20,798
They murdered the last Hand.

573
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:23,201
Now you want Ned
to take the job?

574
00:49:23,235 --> 00:49:25,069
The king rode for a month

575
00:49:25,104 --> 00:49:27,138
to ask for Lord Stark's help.

576
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:29,807
He's the only one he trusts.

577
00:49:31,276 --> 00:49:34,413
You swore the king an oath, my lord.

578
00:49:34,447 --> 00:49:37,548
He's spent half his life
fighting Robert's wars.

579
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:40,084
He owes him nothing.

580
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,022
Your father and brother
rode south once

581
00:49:45,056 --> 00:49:47,924
on a king's demand.

582
00:49:49,727 --> 00:49:51,928
A different time.

583
00:49:53,364 --> 00:49:55,431
A different king.

When do I meet with the Khal?

589
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:00,097
We need to begin
planning the invasion.

590
00:51:00,132 --> 00:51:02,599
If Khal Drogo has
promised you a crown,

591
00:51:02,633 --> 00:51:04,601
- you shall have it.
- When?

592
00:51:04,635 --> 00:51:06,736
When their omens favor war.

593
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:10,039
I piss on Dothraki omens.

594
00:51:10,074 --> 00:51:13,310
I've waited 17 years
to get my throne back.

A Dothraki wedding

600
00:52:14,674 --> 00:52:18,210
without at least three deaths
is considered a dull affair.

thank you in Dothraki.

from one end or the other
it'll be a miracle.

The greatest in the land...
my spear never misses.

It's not hunting
