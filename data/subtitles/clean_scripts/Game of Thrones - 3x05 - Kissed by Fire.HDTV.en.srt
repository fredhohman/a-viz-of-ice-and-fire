1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,126
<i>The Tyrells are a problem.</i>

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,795
The Tyrells helped us
defeat Stannis Baratheon.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,263
You must see Highgarden.

4
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:08,699
I don't think the queen
would let me leave King's Landing.

5
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:10,634
Once I marry Joffrey,
I'll be queen.

6
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:14,307
And if you were
to marry Loras...

7
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:16,944
You must give yourself
to the Lord of Light.

8
00:00:16,979 --> 00:00:19,482
- I have a wife.
- She's shut away in a tower.

9
00:00:19,517 --> 00:00:22,685
And she's given you no sons,
only stillborns.

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,557
I lost one son to the Kingslayer,
strangled with a chain.

11
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:28,159
I grieve for
your sons, my lord.

12
00:00:28,193 --> 00:00:30,461
I don't want your grief.
I want my vengeance.

13
00:00:34,132 --> 00:00:37,234
Do that again
and I'll take your other hand.

14
00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:39,505
- What value was the mill?
- I seized an opportunity.

15
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,708
<i>We took hostages--</i>
<i>Willem Lannister, Martyn Lannister.</i>

16
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:45,338
Willem and Martyn Lannister
are 14 years old.

17
00:00:45,372 --> 00:00:47,369
I'm not your enemy.

18
00:00:47,404 --> 00:00:48,545
This woman is evil!

19
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,527
Take him to the dungeon
and lock him in a cell.

20
00:00:50,804 --> 00:00:52,138
You want to
assassinate a girl?

21
00:00:52,172 --> 00:00:55,107
- Based on whose information?
<i>- Ser Jorah Mormont.</i>

22
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:57,409
He is serving as advisor
to the Targaryens.

23
00:00:57,444 --> 00:00:59,745
You bring us the whispers
of a traitor.

24
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,048
Beric Dondarrion?
If you mean to murder me,

25
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,851
then bloody well
get on with it.

26
00:01:03,885 --> 00:01:06,253
You'll die soon enough,
but it won't be murder.

27
00:01:06,288 --> 00:01:08,856
I sentence you
to trial by combat.

28
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:12,993
Is it done, then?

Orell says there are crows
patrolling on the Wall.

Tell me what you know.

63
00:07:24,687 --> 00:07:26,421
There are four
to a patrol--

64
00:07:26,456 --> 00:07:28,323
two builders to check
for structural damage,

65
00:07:28,357 --> 00:07:29,791
two rangers to watch
for enemies.

66
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:31,893
How often do these
patrols go out?

67
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:34,829
It varies.

68
00:07:34,863 --> 00:07:37,499
If I knew where on the Wall we
were heading, I could tell you.

69
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:40,002
You'd like to know that.

70
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:44,507
There are 19 castles
guarding the Wall.

71
00:07:45,976 --> 00:07:48,344
How many are manned?

72
00:07:48,378 --> 00:07:50,714
Three.

73
00:07:50,748 --> 00:07:53,417
You sure of that?

74
00:07:55,086 --> 00:07:56,687
Which three?

75
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:00,858
Castle Black.

76
00:08:00,892 --> 00:08:02,726
Aye, Castle Black.

77
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,861
Everyone knows
Castle Black.

78
00:08:04,896 --> 00:08:06,896
Which others?

79
00:08:12,135 --> 00:08:14,504
Eastwatch-by-the-Sea

80
00:08:14,538 --> 00:08:17,440
and the Shadow Tower.

81
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:21,677
How many men remain
in Castle Black?

82
00:08:21,712 --> 00:08:23,446
- 1,000.
- Liar.

83
00:08:25,516 --> 00:08:27,617
What happens to your eagle
after I kill you?

84
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:30,186
Does he drift away like a
kite with his strings cut

85
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,521
or does he just flop
dead to the ground?

86
00:08:32,556 --> 00:08:34,056
He's no crow.

87
00:08:34,091 --> 00:08:36,491
Just 'cause you want him inside
you don't make him one of us.

88
00:08:36,493 --> 00:08:38,995
I'm not afraid of you.

89
00:08:45,202 --> 00:08:47,169
I like you, boy.

90
00:08:47,204 --> 00:08:50,106
But if you lie to me,

91
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,376
I'll pull your guts out
through your throat.

92
00:08:55,712 --> 00:08:57,913
1,000 men.

93
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:05,788
We'll find out soon enough.

94
00:09:12,729 --> 00:09:14,363
I don't need you
to protect me.

95
00:09:14,398 --> 00:09:15,798
Of course you do.

96
00:09:15,832 --> 00:09:18,667
Who stopped Rattleshirt
when he was about to cut your throat?

97
00:09:18,702 --> 00:09:21,503
Who vouched for you
with Mance?

98
00:09:21,538 --> 00:09:23,572
It seems
you owe me a debt.

99
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:27,443
- Give it back.
- Well, I stole it.

100
00:09:27,477 --> 00:09:31,179
It's mine.
If you want it, come steal it back.

101
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:34,983

106
00:09:52,469 --> 00:09:54,437
Are you still a crow?

107
00:09:55,873 --> 00:09:59,208
It's time you
proved yourself.

108
00:09:59,243 --> 00:10:00,977
Ygritte.

109
00:10:01,011 --> 00:10:03,613
You swore some vows.

110
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,548
I want you to break 'em.

111
00:10:08,452 --> 00:10:10,819
I want you to see me.

112
00:10:13,356 --> 00:10:15,657
All of me.

113
00:10:29,305 --> 00:10:31,106
We shouldn't.

114
00:10:33,543 --> 00:10:35,377
We should.

115
00:10:55,097 --> 00:10:57,332
Why are you
still dressed?

116
00:10:57,367 --> 00:10:59,868
You know nothing,
Jon Sno--

117
00:11:14,984 --> 00:11:16,918
That thing you did

118
00:11:16,953 --> 00:11:18,920
with your mouth--

119
00:11:20,456 --> 00:11:23,292
is that what lords
do to their ladies in the South?

120
00:11:23,326 --> 00:11:25,461
I don't know.

121
00:11:25,495 --> 00:11:27,263
I just wanted to kiss
you there is all.

122
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:28,765
Hmm.

123
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,500
You seemed to like it.

124
00:11:30,535 --> 00:11:32,936
Aye, I liked it some.

125
00:11:32,971 --> 00:11:34,538
Who taught you that?

126
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:37,441
There's been no one else.
Only you.

127
00:11:37,475 --> 00:11:39,376
A maid.

128
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,245
You were a maid.

129
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,181
I was a man
of the Night's Watch.

130
00:11:45,883 --> 00:11:48,118
How about you?
Were you a maid?

131
00:11:48,152 --> 00:11:49,553
What do you think?

132
00:11:49,587 --> 00:11:52,455
- Who was he?
- Just a boy.

133
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,091
He came trading
with his brothers.

134
00:11:55,126 --> 00:11:58,294
He had red hair like me.
Kissed by fire.

135
00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:00,229
But...

136
00:12:00,297 --> 00:12:02,765
he was weak.

137
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,500
Not like you.

138
00:12:04,535 --> 00:12:06,469
That was the first one.

139
00:12:06,504 --> 00:12:08,472
Then there was
this Thenn boy.

140
00:12:08,506 --> 00:12:11,942
Spoke no Common, but gods,
he was built like a mammoth.

141
00:12:11,977 --> 00:12:15,145
Yeah, thanks.
I think I've heard enough.

142
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,783
We'd best get back.

143
00:12:19,818 --> 00:12:22,186
Tormund--

144
00:12:24,489 --> 00:12:26,524
I'm not done

145
00:12:33,565 --> 00:12:35,966
How long's it been
since you had a bath?

146
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:53,617
Let's not go back.

147
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:57,521
Let's stay here
a while longer.

148
00:12:59,924 --> 00:13:03,193
I don't ever want
to leave this cave, Jon Snow.

149
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:07,363
Not ever.

150
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:19,410
<i>I want my gold.</i>

151
00:13:19,444 --> 00:13:20,878
It says it clearly
right there on that note

152
00:13:20,913 --> 00:13:22,480
you'll be repaid in full
when the war is over.

153
00:13:22,514 --> 00:13:24,849
Piss on that!
You're nothing but thieves.

154
00:13:24,883 --> 00:13:27,084
We're outlaws.
Outlaws steal.

155
00:13:27,118 --> 00:13:28,619
You're lucky
we didn't kill you.

156
00:13:28,653 --> 00:13:29,620
Come try it, archer.

157
00:13:29,655 --> 00:13:31,255
I'll shove those arrows
up your ass.

158
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:33,825
You can't let him go.
He's a murderer. He's guilty.

159
00:13:33,859 --> 00:13:35,993
- Not in the eyes of god.
- You can't!

160
00:13:36,028 --> 00:13:39,197
Enough! The judgment
isn't ours to make.

161
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:45,036
Go in peace,
Sandor Clegane.

162
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:46,804
The Lord of Light

164
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:06,891
The Kingslayer.

165
00:14:06,926 --> 00:14:07,993
Down!

166
00:14:08,027 --> 00:14:10,195
On your knees.

167
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:13,332
Lord Bolton, I give you
the Kingslayer.

168
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:16,936
Pick him up, Locke.

169
00:14:23,544 --> 00:14:25,011
You've lost a hand.

170
00:14:25,045 --> 00:14:27,880
No, my lord,
he has it here.

171
00:14:31,351 --> 00:14:33,318
- Take this away.
- Send it to his father?

172
00:14:33,353 --> 00:14:35,454
You'll hold your tongue
unless you want to lose it.

173
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:39,158
Cut her free.
Apologies, my lady.

174
00:14:39,192 --> 00:14:41,226
You're under
my protection now.

175
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,896
Thank you, my lord.

176
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,201
Find suitable rooms
for our guests.

177
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:51,971
We'll speak later.

178
00:14:53,607 --> 00:14:55,108
Lord Bolton.

179
00:14:58,946 --> 00:15:00,980
Is there word
from the capital?

180
00:15:02,216 --> 00:15:03,783
You haven't heard?

181
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:07,954
Stannis Baratheon laid siege
to King's Landing.

182
00:15:07,988 --> 00:15:10,423
<i>Sailed into Blackwater Bay.</i>

183
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,694
<i>Stormed the gates</i>
<i>with thousands of men.</i>

184
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,730
And your sister...

185
00:15:22,103 --> 00:15:24,204
How can I put this?

186
00:15:26,407 --> 00:15:28,141
Your sister...

187
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,678
is alive and well.

188
00:15:31,712 --> 00:15:34,514
Your father's forces
prevailed.

189
00:15:36,249 --> 00:15:38,117
Ser Jaime isn't well.

190
00:15:38,151 --> 00:15:40,586
Take him to Qyburn.

191
00:15:59,572 --> 00:16:02,407
- Will I die?
- No.

192
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:03,842
The corruption
has spread.

193
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:05,877
I fear it must
be cut away.

194
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:08,980
The safest course would be
to take the whole arm off.

195
00:16:09,015 --> 00:16:11,449
Then you'll die.

196
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:15,454
You're no maester.

197
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:18,223
Where's your chain?

198
00:16:18,258 --> 00:16:20,325
The Citadel
stripped me of it.

199
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,595
They found some
of my experiments

200
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:25,597
too bold.

201
00:16:25,632 --> 00:16:29,269
I can leave your upper arm,
make the cut at your elbow.

202
00:16:29,303 --> 00:16:33,073
I don't need my right hand
to kill you.

203
00:16:34,141 --> 00:16:36,543
I can take away
the rotting flesh

204
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,246
and try and burn out
the corruption

205
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,515
- with boiling wine.
- Mmm.

206
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:43,750
With any luck,
that will suffice.

207
00:16:43,818 --> 00:16:46,286
You'll need
milk of the poppy.

208
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,589
- No milk of the poppy.
- There will be pain.

209
00:16:49,624 --> 00:16:52,793
- I'll scream.
- Quite a bit of pain.

210
00:16:52,827 --> 00:16:54,929
I'll scream loudly.

211
00:17:29,665 --> 00:17:31,299
Lord Baelish.

212
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,967
Your Grace.

213
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:34,969
I wonder if I might
ask you for a favor.

214
00:17:35,003 --> 00:17:36,404
Of course, Your Grace.

215
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:37,838
I have reason to believe
that House Tyrell

216
00:17:37,872 --> 00:17:39,907
do not hold the crown's
best interests at heart.

217
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:44,411
I see. And have you shared these
suspicions with Lord Tywin?

218
00:17:44,445 --> 00:17:47,380
My father's a practical man.
He appreciates facts.

219
00:17:47,415 --> 00:17:50,083
Myself, I often
find them a hindrance.

220
00:17:50,118 --> 00:17:53,220
And he appreciates those
who aid his family, as you well know.

221
00:17:53,255 --> 00:17:54,789
He's almost as generous
to those who help us

222
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:58,025
as he is unpleasant
towards those who don't.

223
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:00,526
You have a good working
relationship with the Tyrells.

224
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:03,462
I thought you might look into it
before you leave the capital.

225
00:18:03,497 --> 00:18:05,664
- I shall do my best.
- Thank you.

226
00:18:05,699 --> 00:18:09,168
And your best will prove better than
when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?

227
00:18:09,202 --> 00:18:10,970
I assure you
that it will.

228
00:18:18,244 --> 00:18:20,578
Gods, boy, that's enough.
We're not in a tavern.

229
00:18:20,613 --> 00:18:22,013
- Pardon, my lady.
- No need to speak.

230
00:18:22,048 --> 00:18:24,249
Are there any figs?
Fetch some.

231
00:18:24,283 --> 00:18:26,385
I always take figs
midafternoon.

232
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:27,886
They help move the bowels.

233
00:18:27,921 --> 00:18:29,988
To what do I owe
this summons?

234
00:18:30,023 --> 00:18:32,057
Thank you for seeing me,
my lady.

235
00:18:32,092 --> 00:18:34,326
I had hoped we might discuss
a few financial matters.

236
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,130
I climbed all those steps to discuss
financial matters?

237
00:18:38,164 --> 00:18:39,431
It's the royal wedding.

238
00:18:39,465 --> 00:18:40,866
I'm told you had a hand
in planning it.

239
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,067
Naturally.

240
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:44,569
It's shaping up to be
a very involved affair.

241
00:18:44,603 --> 00:18:46,704
The word extravagant
has been used.

242
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:48,406
What good
is the word extravagant

243
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,842
if it can't be used
to describe a royal wedding?

244
00:18:50,876 --> 00:18:52,944
- I understand that.
- Good.

245
00:18:52,978 --> 00:18:55,446
But, as Master of Coin,
it falls upon me

246
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,114
to calculate the cost
for the crown.

247
00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:59,651
As of now,
it's a huge expense.

248
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:00,818
And?

249
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:04,522
And we're at war,
Lady Olenna.

250
00:19:04,556 --> 00:19:06,925
Oh, I'd nearly
forgotten.

251
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,326
Yes, and maintaining
supply lines--

252
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,094
<i>I can't think</i>
<i>how it slipped my mind.</i>

253
00:19:10,129 --> 00:19:12,730
What is it,
12,000 infantrymen

254
00:19:12,764 --> 00:19:14,565
<i>the Tyrell family</i>
<i>has supplied?</i>

255
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:16,867
1,800 mounted lances.

256
00:19:16,902 --> 00:19:18,869
<i>2,000 in support.</i>

257
00:19:18,904 --> 00:19:22,006
Provisions so this city
might survive the winter.

258
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,741
<i>A million bushels</i>
<i>of wheat.</i>

259
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:27,311
Half a million bushels each
of barley, oats, and rye.

260
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:29,113
<i>20,000 head of cattle.</i>

261
00:19:29,148 --> 00:19:30,715
<i>50,000 sheep.</i>

262
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,218
You don't have to lecture me
about wartime expenses.

263
00:19:33,253 --> 00:19:35,254
I'm quite familiar
with them.

264
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:36,956
And we are so grateful
for your contributions

265
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,525
which are necessary
for the preservation of the realm.

266
00:19:39,593 --> 00:19:41,428
As is a royal wedding.

267
00:19:41,462 --> 00:19:44,031
The people are hungry
for more than just food.

268
00:19:44,065 --> 00:19:45,499
They crave distractions.

269
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:48,802
And if we don't provide them,
they'll create their own.

270
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:51,472
And their distractions
are likely to end

271
00:19:51,506 --> 00:19:53,774
with us being torn
to pieces.

272
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:56,143
<i>A royal wedding</i>
<i>is much safer.</i>

273
00:19:56,178 --> 00:19:59,213
- Wouldn't you say?
- I would.

274
00:19:59,248 --> 00:20:01,415
<i>And traditionally</i>
<i>paid for</i>

275
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,518
by the royal family.

276
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,188
I was told you were
drunk, impertinent,

277
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:09,223
and thoroughly debauched.

278
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:10,825
You can imagine
my disappointment

279
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,828
at finding nothing
but a browbeaten bookkeeper.

280
00:20:15,731 --> 00:20:18,299
Where did you go
for them, Volantis?

281
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:21,235
- My lady--
- Oh, very well.

282
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,271
I won't have it said
that House Tyrell

283
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,006
refuses to play
its part.

284
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,574
We'll pay for half
the expenses

285
00:20:26,609 --> 00:20:29,243
and the celebrations
will go on as planned.

286
00:20:29,278 --> 00:20:31,078
- Is that sufficient?
- Quite sufficient. Thank you.

287
00:20:31,113 --> 00:20:33,448
Very good, then.
That's settled. Good day.

288
00:20:36,518 --> 00:20:38,586
Give me that.

289
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:45,226
<i>What are you doing?</i>

290
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:48,363
Just mending
Lord Beric's armor.

291
00:20:48,397 --> 00:20:50,599
Why?

292
00:20:50,633 --> 00:20:53,034
I'm going to stay on
and smith for the Brotherhood.

293
00:20:53,068 --> 00:20:54,936
Have you lost your mind?

294
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,473
When the Lannisters find this place,
you think they'll spare the smiths?

295
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,108
They'll cave your head in
with your own helmet.

296
00:21:00,142 --> 00:21:02,910
The Lannisters wanted to kill me long
before I joined the Brotherhood.

297
00:21:02,944 --> 00:21:04,879
You don't have to do this.

298
00:21:04,913 --> 00:21:06,714
I want to.

299
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:08,182
They need good men.

300
00:21:08,217 --> 00:21:11,519
Robb needs good men, too.
We're leaving tomorrow.

301
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:13,921
- And then you--
- What? Serve him?

302
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,992
I've served men
my entire life.

303
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,827
I served Master Mott
at King's Landing

304
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,463
and he sold me
to the Watch.

305
00:21:22,497 --> 00:21:24,098
I served Lord Tywin
at Harrenhal,

306
00:21:24,132 --> 00:21:27,067
wondering every day
if I'd get tortured or killed.

307
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:29,503
I'm done serving.

308
00:21:29,537 --> 00:21:31,872
You just said you were
serving Lord Beric.

309
00:21:33,141 --> 00:21:36,676
He may be their leader,
but they chose him.

310
00:21:36,711 --> 00:21:39,846
These men are brothers.
They're a family.

311
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,450
I've never had a family.

312
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,122
I can be your family.

313
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:53,995
You wouldn't be
my family.

314
00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:55,630
You'd be "my lady."

315
00:22:14,484 --> 00:22:16,318
Willem.

316
00:22:18,888 --> 00:22:20,489
Willem!

317
00:22:23,527 --> 00:22:26,863
- Is this a rescue?
- Lannister filth! Take him!

318
00:22:26,897 --> 00:22:29,265
Please, I didn't do anything.
I'm just a squire.

319
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,100
Please--

320
00:22:43,881 --> 00:22:45,315
Bring them in.

321
00:23:01,698 --> 00:23:03,298
Is that all of them?

322
00:23:05,568 --> 00:23:08,638
It took five of you to murder
two unarmed squires?

323
00:23:08,672 --> 00:23:10,573
Not murder,
Your Grace.

324
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:12,141
Vengeance.

325
00:23:12,175 --> 00:23:14,677
Vengeance?

326
00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:17,079
Those boys didn't
kill your sons.

327
00:23:17,113 --> 00:23:20,182
I saw Harrion die
on the battlefield and Torrhen--

328
00:23:20,216 --> 00:23:22,217
Was strangled
by the Kingslayer.

329
00:23:22,251 --> 00:23:24,519
- They were his kin.
- They were boys!

330
00:23:26,688 --> 00:23:28,456
Look at them.

331
00:23:30,258 --> 00:23:31,892
Tell your mother
to look at them.

332
00:23:31,927 --> 00:23:34,228
<i>She killed them</i>
<i>as much as I.</i>

333
00:23:34,262 --> 00:23:36,897
My mother had nothing
to do with this.

334
00:23:36,931 --> 00:23:38,765
This was your treason.

335
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,234
It's treason
to free your enemies.

336
00:23:41,268 --> 00:23:43,369
In war, you kill
your enemies.

337
00:23:43,403 --> 00:23:45,505
Did your father
not teach you that, boy?

338
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:47,573
Leave him.

339
00:23:51,745 --> 00:23:53,346
Aye.

340
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,714
Leave me to the king.

341
00:23:55,749 --> 00:23:59,385
He wants to give me
a scolding before he sets me free.

342
00:24:00,487 --> 00:24:03,889
That's how he deals
with treason.

343
00:24:03,924 --> 00:24:06,225
Our King in the North.

344
00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:08,627
Or should I call him

345
00:24:08,662 --> 00:24:11,697
the King Who Lost
the North?

346
00:24:14,501 --> 00:24:17,035
Escort Lord Karstark
to the dungeon.

347
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,770
Hang the rest.

348
00:24:18,805 --> 00:24:20,272
Mercy, sire!
I didn't kill anyone.

349
00:24:20,307 --> 00:24:21,774
I only watched
for the guards.

350
00:24:21,808 --> 00:24:23,943
This one was only
the watcher.

351
00:24:23,977 --> 00:24:26,045
Hang him last so he can watch
the others die.

352
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:28,181
<i>Please! Please, no.</i>
<i>They made me do it!</i>

353
00:24:28,215 --> 00:24:32,151
They made me!
They made me!

354
00:24:40,227 --> 00:24:42,662
Word of this
can't leave Riverrun.

355
00:24:42,696 --> 00:24:44,564
They were Tywin
Lannister's nephews.

356
00:24:44,598 --> 00:24:46,299
The Lannisters
pay their debts.

357
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:47,734
<i>They never stop</i>
<i>talking about it.</i>

358
00:24:47,768 --> 00:24:49,703
Would you make me a liar
as well as a murderer?

359
00:24:49,737 --> 00:24:51,471
It wouldn't be lying.

360
00:24:51,505 --> 00:24:53,706
We will bury them
and remain silent

361
00:24:53,741 --> 00:24:55,141
<i>until the war is done.</i>

362
00:24:55,175 --> 00:24:56,576
I'm not fighting
for justice

363
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:59,479
if I don't serve justice
to murderers in my ranks,

364
00:24:59,513 --> 00:25:02,449
<i>no matter how highborn.</i>

365
00:25:02,483 --> 00:25:05,052
He has to die.

366
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,788
The Karstarks
are Northmen.

367
00:25:07,822 --> 00:25:10,157
They won't forgive
the killing of their lord.

368
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:12,159
Your mother's right.

369
00:25:12,193 --> 00:25:14,962
If you do this, the Karstarks will
abandon you.

370
00:25:14,996 --> 00:25:17,064
You tended to their wounds.

371
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,801
You brought them supper.
Now they're dead.

372
00:25:19,835 --> 00:25:23,672
And more boys will keep dying
until this war is over.

373
00:25:23,706 --> 00:25:25,841
<i>You need Karstark men</i>
<i>to end it.</i>

374
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:28,310
Spare his life.
Keep him as a hostage.

375
00:25:28,344 --> 00:25:30,412
A hostage.

376
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:33,750
<i>Tell the Karstarks</i>
<i>that as long as they remain loyal,</i>

377
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:35,852
he will not be harmed.

378
00:26:00,878 --> 00:26:04,147
The blood of the First Men
flows through my veins

379
00:26:04,181 --> 00:26:07,183
as much as yours, boy.

380
00:26:07,218 --> 00:26:09,919
I fought the Mad King
for your father.

381
00:26:09,953 --> 00:26:13,557
I fought Joffrey
for you.

382
00:26:13,592 --> 00:26:15,059
We are kin--

383
00:26:15,093 --> 00:26:17,394
Stark and Karstark.

384
00:26:17,428 --> 00:26:19,829
That didn't stop you
from betraying me.

385
00:26:19,864 --> 00:26:21,431
And it won't save you now.

386
00:26:21,465 --> 00:26:24,333
I don't want it
to save me.

387
00:26:24,368 --> 00:26:28,004
I want it to haunt you
to the end of your days.

388
00:26:28,939 --> 00:26:30,673
Kneel, my lord.

389
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:42,151
Rickard Karstark,

390
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:43,753
<i>Lord of Karhold,</i>

391
00:26:43,788 --> 00:26:47,291
here in sight of gods and men,
I sentence you to die.

392
00:26:47,325 --> 00:26:50,227
Would you speak
a final word?

393
00:26:51,363 --> 00:26:53,898
Kill me
and be cursed.

394
00:26:53,933 --> 00:26:57,035
You are no king of mine.

395
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:13,651
<i>Joffrey.</i>

396
00:27:13,685 --> 00:27:15,686
Cersei.

397
00:27:17,356 --> 00:27:19,357
Ilyn Payne.

398
00:27:20,927 --> 00:27:22,928
Ser Meryn.

399
00:27:26,066 --> 00:27:28,134
The Hound.

400
00:27:31,605 --> 00:27:33,573
What are you
going to do with me?

401
00:27:33,608 --> 00:27:36,243
At first light
we'll ride for Riverrun.

402
00:27:36,277 --> 00:27:38,111
Your brother's there now.

403
00:27:38,146 --> 00:27:40,614
He'll make a contribution
to our cause

404
00:27:40,648 --> 00:27:42,316
and you can go home.

405
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:45,085
I'm a hostage
and you're selling me.

406
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,554
Don't think of it
that way.

407
00:27:46,588 --> 00:27:49,256
- But it is that way.
- <i>It is.</i>

408
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:52,125
- And it isn't.
- More is than isn't.

409
00:27:54,095 --> 00:27:57,264
Beric admired your father
a great deal, you know.

410
00:27:57,298 --> 00:27:59,433
He wanted to refuse
your ransom altogether.

411
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:02,969
- So why don't you?
- We need the gold.

412
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:16,750
Do I frighten you, child?

413
00:28:16,785 --> 00:28:18,619
No.

414
00:28:21,456 --> 00:28:23,190
You're angry with me.

415
00:28:23,224 --> 00:28:24,858
And I don't blame you.

416
00:28:24,892 --> 00:28:26,412
But letting him go
was the right thing.

417
00:28:26,427 --> 00:28:28,996
I have more reason than most
to want him hanged.

418
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,531
- I thought he killed you.
- He did.

419
00:28:31,566 --> 00:28:33,400
But how...?

420
00:28:33,434 --> 00:28:35,602
Thoros...

421
00:28:35,636 --> 00:28:37,504
how many times
have you brought me back?

422
00:28:37,538 --> 00:28:41,007
It's the Lord of Light
brings you back.

423
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:43,275
I'm just the lucky drunk
who says the words.

424
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,944
- How many times?
- <i>Five, I think.</i>

425
00:28:45,979 --> 00:28:48,113
<i>No, this makes six.</i>

426
00:28:48,147 --> 00:28:49,481
Six.

427
00:28:49,515 --> 00:28:52,484
There was the first time--
the Mountain.

428
00:28:52,518 --> 00:28:54,052
<i>Show her.</i>

429
00:28:54,086 --> 00:28:57,855
Lance right through
the chest.

430
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,325
Then I was stabbed
in the belly.

431
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:01,726
Then it was an arrow
in the back.

432
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,495
<i>And that axe in the side.</i>

433
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:07,865
Then the Lannisters caught me
and executed me for treason.

434
00:29:09,401 --> 00:29:11,736
Was it a hanging
or a dagger in the eye?

435
00:29:11,803 --> 00:29:14,939
Both.
Fuckers couldn't decide.

436
00:29:14,973 --> 00:29:17,508
<i>And the Hound makes six.</i>

437
00:29:17,543 --> 00:29:19,678
Second time I've been
killed by a Clegane.

438
00:29:19,712 --> 00:29:21,713
<i>You'd think you'd learn.</i>

439
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:25,951
It's not getting
any easier, you know.

440
00:29:25,985 --> 00:29:27,986
<i>I know.</i>

441
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,121
<i>Every time I come back,</i>

442
00:29:30,156 --> 00:29:32,190
I'm a bit less.

443
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,194
Pieces of you
get chipped away.

444
00:29:37,696 --> 00:29:39,998
Could you bring back
a man without a head?

445
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,636
Not six times.
Just once.

446
00:29:45,671 --> 00:29:48,573
I don't think it works
that way, child.

447
00:29:53,546 --> 00:29:57,149
He was a good man,
Ned Stark.

448
00:29:57,183 --> 00:30:01,086
<i>He's at rest now,</i>
<i>somewhere.</i>

449
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,521
I would never wish
my life upon him.

450
00:30:03,556 --> 00:30:05,690
I would.

451
00:30:07,994 --> 00:30:10,095
You're alive.

452
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,102
Lord, cast your light
upon me.

453
00:30:19,137 --> 00:30:22,507
Protect me
in the darkness.

454
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:26,044
Burn away my sins.

455
00:30:26,078 --> 00:30:29,314
Help me serve you.

456
00:30:29,349 --> 00:30:31,517
Use me as you will.

457
00:30:33,987 --> 00:30:36,589
For the night is dark

458
00:30:36,624 --> 00:30:39,125
and full of terrors.

459
00:30:50,204 --> 00:30:53,106
I have prayed day and night
for you to come to me.

460
00:30:54,742 --> 00:30:56,810
My lady.

461
00:30:56,844 --> 00:30:59,679
I meant to come sooner.

462
00:30:59,713 --> 00:31:02,949
- The battle--
- I know of your troubles, my king.

463
00:31:02,983 --> 00:31:05,719
The Lady Melisandre
has told me everything.

464
00:31:05,753 --> 00:31:08,255
Yes, of course.

465
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,769
You mustn't despair.
Your claim is true.

466
00:31:20,803 --> 00:31:23,571
- You will be victorious.
- I believed that once.

467
00:31:23,606 --> 00:31:27,042
You are
the one god's champion

468
00:31:27,076 --> 00:31:29,311
and the finest man
I've ever known.

469
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,813
Selyse.

470
00:31:33,115 --> 00:31:35,650
I've broken a sacred vow.

471
00:31:39,121 --> 00:31:40,489
I've sinned.

472
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:43,659
- No.
- I've wronged you.

473
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:47,296
- I have shamed you.
- You're doing god's work.

474
00:31:47,331 --> 00:31:49,399
You don't understand.

475
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,107
The Red Woman--

476
00:31:58,777 --> 00:32:00,577
the Lady Melisandre--

477
00:32:00,612 --> 00:32:02,579
I know, Stannis.

478
00:32:02,614 --> 00:32:06,650
The Lady Melisandre
has told me everything.

479
00:32:06,684 --> 00:32:09,920
No act done in service
of the Lord of Light

480
00:32:09,955 --> 00:32:12,723
can ever be a sin.

481
00:32:12,757 --> 00:32:16,027
When she told me,

482
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:20,264
I wept with joy.

483
00:32:30,743 --> 00:32:34,412
Oh, my sweet boys.

484
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:39,584
<i>Petyr, Tommard,</i>

485
00:32:39,618 --> 00:32:41,620
<i>Edric.</i>

486
00:32:42,722 --> 00:32:46,458
I thank god
every day

487
00:32:46,493 --> 00:32:49,529
<i>for bringing</i>
<i>Melisandre to us.</i>

488
00:32:49,563 --> 00:32:51,898
She gave you a son.

489
00:32:53,201 --> 00:32:55,869
I gave you...

490
00:32:57,038 --> 00:32:59,472
- <i>nothing.</i>
- That's not true.

491
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:06,912
So you've come
to see her as well?

492
00:33:09,348 --> 00:33:11,282
There is no need.

493
00:33:12,685 --> 00:33:15,252
You must keep away
from such distractions.

494
00:33:15,287 --> 00:33:16,987
She's my daughter.

495
00:33:19,257 --> 00:33:20,624
I want to see her.

496
00:33:23,328 --> 00:33:25,964
You are a king.

497
00:33:25,998 --> 00:33:28,800
You don't need
my permission.

Father!

507
00:34:04,472 --> 00:34:06,572
You've grown
since I last saw you.

508
00:34:06,607 --> 00:34:10,110
Mother said you fought
in a battle.

509
00:34:10,144 --> 00:34:11,712
Did you win?

510
00:34:13,014 --> 00:34:15,015
No.

511
00:34:15,049 --> 00:34:17,484
Did the Onion Knight
come back with you?

512
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,954
He did.

513
00:34:20,988 --> 00:34:22,723
He fought bravely.

514
00:34:22,757 --> 00:34:24,424
He hasn't come
to visit me.

515
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:27,460
He said he'd bring me back a
present from the capital.

516
00:34:27,495 --> 00:34:29,162
He won't be visiting, child.

517
00:34:29,196 --> 00:34:31,730
Why not?
He's my friend.

518
00:34:31,765 --> 00:34:33,332
Look.

519
00:34:40,472 --> 00:34:42,540
He made this for me.

520
00:34:42,575 --> 00:34:44,943
But don't tell Mother
I have it.

521
00:34:44,977 --> 00:34:46,878
It's a secret.

522
00:34:46,913 --> 00:34:49,581
Mother doesn't like
the Onion Knight.

523
00:34:51,751 --> 00:34:54,053
Ser Davos
is a traitor.

524
00:34:56,022 --> 00:34:59,325
He's rotting in a dungeon
cell for his crime.

525
00:35:08,502 --> 00:35:10,536
Best forget him.

526
00:35:22,316 --> 00:35:25,218
Not so hard.
You'll scrub the skin off.

527
00:35:25,252 --> 00:35:26,686
What are you
doing here?

528
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,054
I need a bath.

529
00:35:28,088 --> 00:35:30,724
Help me out
of these rags.

530
00:35:37,732 --> 00:35:40,200
Now get out.

531
00:35:52,614 --> 00:35:54,248
There's another tub.

532
00:35:54,282 --> 00:35:57,217
This one suits me fine.

533
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,731
Don't worry.
I'm not interested.

534
00:36:14,867 --> 00:36:18,136
<i>If I faint, pull me out.</i>

535
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:21,205
I don't intend to be the first Lannister
to die in a bathtub.

536
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,007
Why should I care
how you die?

537
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:26,010
You swore a solemn vow,
remember?

538
00:36:26,044 --> 00:36:29,713
You're supposed to get me to
King's Landing in one piece.

539
00:36:30,682 --> 00:36:33,183
Not going so well, is it?

540
00:36:33,218 --> 00:36:35,852
No wonder Renly died
with you guarding him.

541
00:36:45,663 --> 00:36:47,998
That was unworthy.
Forgive me.

542
00:36:48,032 --> 00:36:50,000
You protected me
better than most--

543
00:36:50,034 --> 00:36:52,770
- Don't you mock me.
- I'm apologizing.

544
00:36:54,573 --> 00:36:56,641
I'm sick of fighting.

545
00:36:56,675 --> 00:36:58,143
<i>Let's call a truce.</i>

546
00:36:58,177 --> 00:36:59,978
You need trust
to have a truce.

547
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,649
I trust you.

548
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:13,527
<i>There it is.</i>
<i>There's the look.</i>

549
00:37:13,561 --> 00:37:16,030
I've seen it for 17 years

550
00:37:16,064 --> 00:37:17,698
on face after face.

551
00:37:17,732 --> 00:37:20,968
<i>You all despise me.</i>

552
00:37:21,002 --> 00:37:22,736
Kingslayer.

553
00:37:22,771 --> 00:37:24,939
Oathbreaker.

554
00:37:24,973 --> 00:37:27,875
A man without honor.

555
00:37:33,514 --> 00:37:35,048
You've heard of wildfire?

556
00:37:35,082 --> 00:37:36,583
Of course.

557
00:37:36,617 --> 00:37:39,386
<i>The Mad King</i>
<i>was obsessed with it.</i>

558
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,955
He loved to watch
people burn,

559
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:44,524
the way their skin
blackened and blistered

560
00:37:44,558 --> 00:37:47,160
<i>and melted</i>
<i>off their bones.</i>

561
00:37:47,195 --> 00:37:49,363
<i>He burned lords</i>
<i>he didn't like.</i>

562
00:37:49,397 --> 00:37:51,465
<i>He burned Hands</i>
<i>who disobeyed him.</i>

563
00:37:51,499 --> 00:37:54,934
He burned anyone
who was against him.

564
00:37:56,337 --> 00:37:59,638
Before long, half the country
was against him.

565
00:38:02,442 --> 00:38:05,043
Aerys saw traitors
everywhere.

566
00:38:06,513 --> 00:38:10,582
So he had his pyromancer
place caches of wildfire

567
00:38:10,616 --> 00:38:13,051
<i>all over the city--</i>

568
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:15,353
beneath the Sept
of Baelor

569
00:38:15,388 --> 00:38:17,155
and the slums
of Flea Bottom.

570
00:38:17,223 --> 00:38:20,493
Under houses,
stables, taverns.

571
00:38:20,527 --> 00:38:23,863
Even beneath
the Red Keep itself.

572
00:38:25,632 --> 00:38:28,001
Finally,

573
00:38:28,035 --> 00:38:31,271
the day
of reckoning came.

574
00:38:31,306 --> 00:38:33,674
Robert Baratheon
marched on the capital

575
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:35,776
after his victory
at the Trident.

576
00:38:35,811 --> 00:38:38,212
But my father
arrived first

577
00:38:38,246 --> 00:38:40,981
with the whole Lannister
army at his back,

578
00:38:41,016 --> 00:38:45,419
promising to defend the city
against the rebels.

579
00:38:47,221 --> 00:38:49,322
I knew my father
better than that.

580
00:38:49,357 --> 00:38:52,692
<i>He's never been one</i>
<i>to pick the losing side.</i>

581
00:38:52,726 --> 00:38:55,295
<i>I told the Mad King</i>
<i>as much.</i>

582
00:38:55,329 --> 00:38:59,065
I urged him
to surrender peacefully.

583
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:02,301
<i>But the king didn't</i>
<i>listen to me.</i>

584
00:39:02,336 --> 00:39:05,038
He didn't listen to Varys
who tried to warn him.

585
00:39:05,072 --> 00:39:09,442
But he did listen
to Grand Maester Pycelle,

586
00:39:09,477 --> 00:39:12,145
that grey, sunken cunt.

587
00:39:13,581 --> 00:39:16,450
"You can trust
the Lannisters," he said.

588
00:39:18,086 --> 00:39:20,354
"The Lannisters
have always been

589
00:39:20,421 --> 00:39:22,623
true friends
of the crown."

590
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:27,494
So we opened the gates

591
00:39:27,528 --> 00:39:29,763
and my father
sacked the city.

592
00:39:29,797 --> 00:39:33,200
<i>Once again,</i>
<i>I came to the king,</i>

593
00:39:33,234 --> 00:39:36,403
begging him to surrender.

594
00:39:40,074 --> 00:39:42,509
He told me to...

595
00:39:42,543 --> 00:39:45,078
bring him
my father's head.

596
00:39:46,414 --> 00:39:48,481
Then he...

597
00:39:48,515 --> 00:39:51,484
turned to his pyromancer.

598
00:39:51,518 --> 00:39:54,286
"Burn them all,"
he said.

599
00:39:55,355 --> 00:39:58,391
"Burn them
in their homes.

600
00:39:58,425 --> 00:40:00,560
Burn them
in their beds."

601
00:40:01,929 --> 00:40:06,701
Tell me,
if your precious Renly

602
00:40:06,735 --> 00:40:09,604
commanded you to kill
your own father

603
00:40:09,638 --> 00:40:12,674
and stand by while
thousands of men,

604
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:14,943
women, and children
burned alive,

605
00:40:14,977 --> 00:40:17,679
would you have done it?

606
00:40:17,713 --> 00:40:19,514
Would you have
kept your oath then?

607
00:40:23,485 --> 00:40:27,088
First, I killed
the pyromancer.

608
00:40:27,122 --> 00:40:30,725
<i>And then when the king</i>
<i>turned to flee,</i>

609
00:40:30,759 --> 00:40:34,262
I drove my sword
into his back.

610
00:40:35,498 --> 00:40:37,999
<i>"Burn them all,"</i>
<i>he kept saying.</i>

611
00:40:38,034 --> 00:40:40,001
"Burn them all."

612
00:40:40,036 --> 00:40:42,270
I don't think
he expected to die.

613
00:40:42,305 --> 00:40:45,240
He-- he meant to...

614
00:40:46,776 --> 00:40:49,277
burn with the rest of us

615
00:40:49,311 --> 00:40:52,113
and rise again,

616
00:40:52,148 --> 00:40:54,015
reborn as a dragon

617
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,950
to turn his enemies
to ash.

618
00:40:59,722 --> 00:41:03,291
I slit his throat to make sure
that didn't happen.

619
00:41:07,396 --> 00:41:11,165
That's where Ned Stark
found me.

620
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:13,400
If this is true...

621
00:41:15,036 --> 00:41:16,904
why didn't you tell anyone?

622
00:41:18,907 --> 00:41:20,774
Why didn't you tell
Lord Stark?

623
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:22,309
Stark?

624
00:41:22,344 --> 00:41:24,812
You think

625
00:41:24,846 --> 00:41:28,783
the honorable Ned Stark

626
00:41:28,817 --> 00:41:32,087
wanted to hear my side?

627
00:41:32,121 --> 00:41:34,822
He judged me guilty

628
00:41:34,857 --> 00:41:37,258
the moment
he set eyes on me.

629
00:41:40,363 --> 00:41:44,199
By what right
does the wolf

630
00:41:44,233 --> 00:41:46,234
judge the lion?

631
00:41:47,537 --> 00:41:49,104
- By what right?
- Help! Help!

632
00:41:49,138 --> 00:41:50,772
The Kingslayer!

633
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:54,109
Jaime.

634
00:41:54,143 --> 00:41:56,145
My name is Jaime.

635
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,718
<i>Onion Knight.</i>

636
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,687
<i>Ser Onion Knight.</i>

637
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:07,357
Princess?
Gods, what are you doing here?

638
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,859
- Shh, you'll wake Bert.
- Bert?

639
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:12,963
He's the fat one.
He's on guard duty tonight.

640
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,898
He likes to drink wine
and sleep a lot.

641
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:17,500
Go back to your room.
You're not supposed to be here.

642
00:42:17,534 --> 00:42:19,669
- If your father knew--
- He said you were a traitor.

643
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,938
Are you?

644
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:24,540
I am, child.

645
00:42:24,574 --> 00:42:26,509
I disobeyed my king,
your father,

646
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:28,377
and now I'm paying
the price.

647
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,913
I don't care.
You're my friend.

648
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:32,882
You must get bored
down here.

649
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,851
I brought you
something to read.

650
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,720
It's about Aegon
and his dragons.

651
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:40,189
Aegon used to live here.
Did you know that?

652
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,025
- And the Targaryens built this castle.
- Aye.

653
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:44,327
- So they did.
- You can hide the book under your cloak.

654
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:46,730
It's a good one.
I'll bring you more.

655
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:49,633
Thank you, my lady.
I'm sure it's a fine book,

656
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,068
but it's wasted on me.

657
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:53,570
Take it.
I have more.

658
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:57,307
My lady, I can't read
the words.

659
00:42:57,342 --> 00:42:59,410
You can't?

660
00:42:59,444 --> 00:43:02,146
I'll teach you. I'll come when
Bert's on duty and teach you.

661
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,014
- No. No. No.
- It's easy. It'll be fun.

662
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:06,183
- Go. We can't.
- Why not?

663
00:43:06,218 --> 00:43:08,986
What will they do,
lock us in cells?

664
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:16,961
I wouldn't know
where to start.

665
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:18,729
At the beginning.

666
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,664
This word is Aegon.

667
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:24,802
When you see A, E, and G
together like that,

668
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:26,737
it sounds like egg.

669
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:28,673
And the title
of the whole book

670
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:30,875
is "An History
of Aegon the Conqueror

671
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:33,077
<i>and His Conquest</i>
<i>of Westeros."</i>

672
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,924
It was a bitch
of a siege.

673
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:49,127
Mm, you were first
through the breach at Pyke?

674
00:43:49,161 --> 00:43:52,630
The second.
Thoros of Myr went in alone,

675
00:43:52,664 --> 00:43:54,832
waving that
flaming sword of his.

676
00:43:54,867 --> 00:43:57,568
Thoros of Myr.
Bloody madman.

677
00:43:57,602 --> 00:44:00,538
Robert knighted you
after the battle?

678
00:44:00,572 --> 00:44:02,440
Proudest moment
of my life.

679
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:05,676
One knee in the dust,
the king's sword on my shoulder,

680
00:44:05,711 --> 00:44:07,011
listening to the words.

681
00:44:07,045 --> 00:44:10,748
"In the name of the Warrior,
I charge you to be brave."

682
00:44:10,783 --> 00:44:13,719
All I could think of
was how badly I had to piss.

683
00:44:15,021 --> 00:44:17,656
In full plate metal
for 16 hours.

684
00:44:17,691 --> 00:44:19,659
Never occurred to me
till the fighting was over.

685
00:44:19,693 --> 00:44:22,896
I was very nearly the first man
knighted to piss on the king's boots.

686
00:44:24,732 --> 00:44:26,967
Robert would have
laughed.

687
00:44:27,001 --> 00:44:29,603
He was a good man,
a great warrior.

688
00:44:31,439 --> 00:44:33,373
And a terrible king.

689
00:44:33,408 --> 00:44:36,776
I burned away my years
fighting for terrible kings.

690
00:44:36,811 --> 00:44:38,345
- You swore an oath.
- Yes.

691
00:44:38,379 --> 00:44:40,247
And a man of honor
keeps his vows,

692
00:44:40,281 --> 00:44:43,683
even if he's serving
a drunk or a lunatic.

693
00:44:43,718 --> 00:44:46,286
Just once in my life
before it's over,

694
00:44:46,321 --> 00:44:49,356
I want to know what it's like
to serve with pride,

695
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:52,526
to fight for someone
I believe in.

696
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,327
Do you believe in her?

697
00:44:57,164 --> 00:44:58,999
With all my heart.

698
00:45:04,138 --> 00:45:05,605
These are the ones?

699
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,774
Yes, khaleesi.
The officers.

700
00:45:43,444 --> 00:45:45,846
All Unsullied boys
are given new names

701
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,480
when they are cut--

702
00:45:47,515 --> 00:45:50,383
Grey Worm, Red Flea,
Black Rat.

703
00:45:50,418 --> 00:45:53,186
<i>Names that remind them</i>
<i>what they are--</i>

704
00:45:53,221 --> 00:45:55,722
vermin.

705
00:46:42,638 --> 00:46:45,006
<i>King Robert</i>
<i>wanted her dead.</i>

706
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:46,274
Of course
he wanted her dead.

707
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:49,411
She's a Targaryen.
The last Targaryen.

708
00:46:49,446 --> 00:46:52,548
I suppose no one on the small
council could speak sense to him.

709
00:46:52,582 --> 00:46:55,117
- I didn't sit on the small council.
- No?

710
00:46:55,152 --> 00:46:57,753
Doesn't the Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard traditionally--

711
00:46:57,788 --> 00:46:59,655
Traditionally, yes,
but I killed a dozen

712
00:46:59,689 --> 00:47:01,824
of Robert's friends
during his rebellion.

713
00:47:03,993 --> 00:47:05,660
He didn't want advice
on how to govern

714
00:47:05,695 --> 00:47:07,629
from a man who had fought
for the Mad King.

715
00:47:07,663 --> 00:47:10,565
Can't say
I minded much.

716
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,767
I always hated
the politics.

717
00:47:12,802 --> 00:47:14,736
Yeah, I imagine
I would, too.

718
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:17,205
Hours spent jabbering
about backstabbings

719
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,408
- and betrayals the world over.
- Mm-hmm.

720
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:25,480
Still, she'll have
to wade through that muck

721
00:47:25,514 --> 00:47:27,716
if she wants to rule
the Seven Kingdoms.

722
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:29,818
She'll have good men
around her to advise her,

723
00:47:29,852 --> 00:47:31,319
men with experience.

724
00:47:31,354 --> 00:47:32,854
Which men do you
have in mind?

725
00:47:32,889 --> 00:47:34,890
Forgive me, Ser Jorah,
for what I'm about to say,

726
00:47:34,924 --> 00:47:38,494
but your reputation in Westeros
has suffered over the years.

727
00:47:38,528 --> 00:47:40,930
It suffered for a reason.

728
00:47:40,964 --> 00:47:42,731
I sold men into slavery.

729
00:47:42,766 --> 00:47:44,600
I don't know
if your presence by her side

730
00:47:44,634 --> 00:47:46,902
will help our cause
when we go home.

731
00:47:46,936 --> 00:47:48,737
Our cause?

732
00:47:48,772 --> 00:47:50,806
Forgive me, Ser Barristan,
but I was busy

733
00:47:50,841 --> 00:47:53,042
defending the khaleesi against
King Robert's assassins

734
00:47:53,076 --> 00:47:54,877
while you were still
bowing to the man.

735
00:47:54,911 --> 00:47:57,913
We both want her to rule.
Am I wrong?

736
00:47:57,948 --> 00:48:00,549
You only joined us
a few days ago.

737
00:48:00,583 --> 00:48:02,717
I can't speak
to your intentions.

738
00:48:02,752 --> 00:48:04,886
If we're truly
her loyal servants,

739
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,722
we will do whatever
needs to be done,

740
00:48:07,756 --> 00:48:10,358
no matter the cost,
no matter our pride.

741
00:48:10,392 --> 00:48:12,960
You're not
Lord Commander here.

742
00:48:12,995 --> 00:48:15,563
You're just another exile.

743
00:48:15,597 --> 00:48:17,665
And I take my orders
from the queen.

744
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,675
<i>- Come to bed.</i>
- You were right.

745
00:48:29,811 --> 00:48:31,645
The Karstarks are gone.

746
00:48:32,613 --> 00:48:34,848
Almost half our forces.

747
00:48:34,882 --> 00:48:38,385
Tywin Lannister knows what he
needs to do to make us unravel.

748
00:48:38,419 --> 00:48:41,288
Nothing.

749
00:48:41,323 --> 00:48:43,457
Only wait.

750
00:48:43,491 --> 00:48:45,993
Don't let him.

751
00:48:46,027 --> 00:48:48,128
What can I do?

752
00:48:48,163 --> 00:48:49,596
Attack King's Landing?

753
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:51,765
There's nothing
he'd like better.

754
00:48:51,799 --> 00:48:53,800
He'd crush us
in a day.

755
00:48:54,836 --> 00:48:55,969
We could ride north.

756
00:48:56,003 --> 00:48:58,672
<i>Take your land back</i>
<i>from the Greyjoys.</i>

757
00:48:58,706 --> 00:49:01,975
- Wait out the winter.
- Winter could last five years.

758
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:03,376
Once my bannermen
are home again,

759
00:49:03,411 --> 00:49:06,180
sitting by the fire,
surrounded by their families,

760
00:49:06,214 --> 00:49:09,283
warm and safe,
they'll never ride south again.

761
00:49:09,317 --> 00:49:11,452
When I gathered
my lords together,

762
00:49:11,487 --> 00:49:13,388
we had a purpose,
a mission.

763
00:49:13,422 --> 00:49:16,190
Now we're like a band
of bickering children.

764
00:49:18,561 --> 00:49:20,462
Give them a new purpose.

765
00:49:20,496 --> 00:49:22,197
What?

766
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:25,900
Oh, I don't know.

767
00:49:25,935 --> 00:49:28,436
I don't even know
where Winterfell is.

768
00:49:31,106 --> 00:49:33,041
Here.

769
00:49:36,279 --> 00:49:39,848
And we're here.
King's Landing--

770
00:49:46,723 --> 00:49:48,257
What is it?

771
00:49:51,494 --> 00:49:54,663
I can't force them
to meet us in the field

772
00:49:54,697 --> 00:49:57,098
and I can't attack them
where they're strongest,

773
00:49:57,132 --> 00:50:00,035
but I can attack them
where they're not.

774
00:50:01,204 --> 00:50:04,072
And Casterly Rock
can't run away.

775
00:50:05,341 --> 00:50:08,377
I'm going to take
their home away from them.

776
00:50:09,646 --> 00:50:11,814
Can you do it?

777
00:50:11,848 --> 00:50:14,851
I need men to replace the Karstarks
who marched home.

778
00:50:14,885 --> 00:50:17,487
There is only one person
in this kingdom

779
00:50:17,521 --> 00:50:20,723
with that kind of army who hasn't
already sided with the Lannisters.

780
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:24,860
The man whose daughter
I was supposed to marry--

781
00:50:25,896 --> 00:50:27,796
Walder Frey.

782
00:50:36,672 --> 00:50:38,940
He's such
a splendid fighter.

783
00:50:38,974 --> 00:50:42,310
Do you have any idea
when we might...

784
00:50:42,345 --> 00:50:45,981
I'll plant the seed
as soon as Joffrey and I are married.

785
00:50:46,015 --> 00:50:47,482
It should grow quickly.

786
00:50:47,516 --> 00:50:49,150
Joffrey won't let me leave.

787
00:50:49,185 --> 00:50:51,920
He's got too many reasons
to keep me here.

788
00:50:51,954 --> 00:50:55,290
And only one
to let you go.

789
00:50:55,324 --> 00:50:57,525
Because it will
please me.

790
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,594
<i>Squire!</i>

791
00:51:03,166 --> 00:51:04,833
Well fought, ser.

792
00:51:04,867 --> 00:51:07,635
That was no fight.
I don't know you.

793
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:10,004
Olyver,
if it please you.

794
00:51:12,174 --> 00:51:15,042
I should like to see you spar with
a proper partner, ser.

795
00:51:23,085 --> 00:51:24,618
How did you know?

796
00:51:24,653 --> 00:51:26,554
Know what?

797
00:51:27,889 --> 00:51:29,724
That I wanted to.

798
00:51:29,758 --> 00:51:31,625
My lord...

799
00:51:35,663 --> 00:51:37,331
I'll have you know
I'm to be married soon

800
00:51:37,365 --> 00:51:40,434
and even my intended
hasn't the slightest notion.

801
00:51:40,468 --> 00:51:43,571
They rarely do,
in my experience.

802
00:51:43,605 --> 00:51:45,973
You have a good deal
of experience, do you?

803
00:51:46,908 --> 00:51:49,076
With the husbands.

804
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,255
That didn't take long.

805
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:02,492
Well, it took long enough.

806
00:52:04,061 --> 00:52:07,030
It seems our Knight of Flowers
is engaged to be wed.

807
00:52:07,064 --> 00:52:08,865
Is he?

808
00:52:08,899 --> 00:52:11,200
And...

809
00:52:11,235 --> 00:52:13,036
who's the lucky girl?

810
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:16,573
<i>She may not be the grandest</i>
<i>ship in the world</i>

811
00:52:16,607 --> 00:52:19,075
or the fastest,

812
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:21,278
but she's mine.

813
00:52:24,816 --> 00:52:26,750
I've always wanted a ship.

814
00:52:26,784 --> 00:52:28,919
Now I want a dozen.

815
00:52:28,954 --> 00:52:31,589
- Strange, isn't it?
- What is?

816
00:52:31,623 --> 00:52:33,792
It doesn't matter
what we want,

817
00:52:33,826 --> 00:52:35,627
once we get it,

818
00:52:35,661 --> 00:52:37,396
then we want
something else.

819
00:52:40,166 --> 00:52:42,868
Your hair is different.

820
00:52:42,902 --> 00:52:44,536
Is it?

821
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:46,171
Lady Margaery
wears it that way.

822
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:48,607
Many ladies
wear it this way.

823
00:52:48,641 --> 00:52:50,376
I have good news.

824
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:52,511
I'll be leaving
the city soon.

825
00:52:52,545 --> 00:52:54,012
You still want me
to come with you?

826
00:52:54,047 --> 00:52:56,248
It's not a question
of what I want.

827
00:52:56,282 --> 00:52:58,484
It's what you want.

828
00:52:58,518 --> 00:52:59,718
You want to go home,
don't you?

829
00:52:59,752 --> 00:53:02,187
Of course.
More than anything.

830
00:53:04,357 --> 00:53:07,759
But maybe it would
be better to wait.

831
00:53:07,794 --> 00:53:10,596
I've been thinking
how dangerous it would be.

832
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:13,498
Not just for me,
but for you.

833
00:53:13,533 --> 00:53:14,799
You've been so kind.

834
00:53:14,834 --> 00:53:18,002
I'd feel terrible if anything
happened to you.

835
00:53:19,138 --> 00:53:21,372
I can't tell you
how touched I am

836
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:24,642
by your concern
for my welfare.

837
00:53:24,677 --> 00:53:27,479
I hope you know that
I'm your friend, Sansa.

838
00:53:27,546 --> 00:53:29,547
Your true friend.

839
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:31,282
I do, Lord Baelish.

840
00:53:31,317 --> 00:53:33,986
- Petyr.
- Petyr.

841
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,121
If you wish to stay,

842
00:53:36,155 --> 00:53:39,157
then of course
you will stay.

843
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:46,431
We'll speak again
when I return.

844
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,578
<i>You're late.</i>

845
00:54:01,612 --> 00:54:04,414
What's she doing here?

846
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:06,483
Our business
concerns her, too.

847
00:54:06,517 --> 00:54:08,351
<i>Sit.</i>

848
00:54:10,355 --> 00:54:11,955
You'll be pleased to learn

849
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:15,058
that after one conversation
with Olenna Tyrell,

850
00:54:15,092 --> 00:54:17,126
I've saved the crown

851
00:54:17,161 --> 00:54:19,963
hundreds of thousands
on this wedding.

852
00:54:19,997 --> 00:54:21,031
Never mind that now.

853
00:54:21,065 --> 00:54:22,585
We have something
important to discuss.

854
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,035
I'm Master of Coin.
Saving money is important.

855
00:54:25,937 --> 00:54:27,371
Stop that.

856
00:54:27,405 --> 00:54:29,339
You're making me
uncomfortable.

857
00:54:29,374 --> 00:54:32,343
Your sister has learned that
your new friends the Tyrells

858
00:54:32,378 --> 00:54:35,381
are plotting to marry
Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.

859
00:54:35,415 --> 00:54:37,183
Very well.

860
00:54:37,217 --> 00:54:39,251
She's a lovely girl.

861
00:54:39,286 --> 00:54:41,286
Missing some of Loras'
favorite bits,

862
00:54:41,321 --> 00:54:43,122
but I'm sure
they'll make do.

863
00:54:43,156 --> 00:54:45,691
- Your jokes are not appreciated.
- It wasn't my best, but--

864
00:54:45,725 --> 00:54:48,827
I bring them into the royal fold
and this is how they repay me,

865
00:54:48,862 --> 00:54:52,331
by trying to steal the key to
the North out from under me.

866
00:54:52,365 --> 00:54:54,033
Sansa is the key
to the North?

867
00:54:54,067 --> 00:54:56,435
I seem to remember
she has an older brother.

868
00:54:56,469 --> 00:54:58,470
The Karstarks
have marched home.

869
00:54:58,505 --> 00:55:01,440
The young wolf has lost half his army.
His days are numbered.

870
00:55:01,475 --> 00:55:04,577
<i>Theon Greyjoy murdered</i>
<i>both his brothers.</i>

871
00:55:04,611 --> 00:55:07,947
That makes Sansa Stark
the heir to Winterfell.

872
00:55:07,982 --> 00:55:11,818
And I am not about
to hand her over to the Tyrells.

873
00:55:11,853 --> 00:55:14,154
<i>The Tyrell army is helping</i>
<i>us to win this war.</i>

874
00:55:14,189 --> 00:55:16,957
Do you really think
it's wise to refuse them?

875
00:55:16,992 --> 00:55:18,792
There's nothing to refuse.
This is a plot.

876
00:55:18,827 --> 00:55:21,629
<i>Plots are not</i>
<i>public knowledge.</i>

877
00:55:21,663 --> 00:55:23,397
And the Tyrells
won't carry this one out

878
00:55:23,432 --> 00:55:25,599
until after
Joffrey's wedding.

879
00:55:25,634 --> 00:55:29,403
We need to act first
and kill this union in its crib.

880
00:55:29,437 --> 00:55:30,838
And how do we do that?

881
00:55:30,872 --> 00:55:33,139
We find Sansa Stark
a different husband.

882
00:55:33,174 --> 00:55:35,775
- Wonderful.
- Yes, it is.

883
00:55:43,351 --> 00:55:44,918
You can't mean it.

884
00:55:44,952 --> 00:55:46,419
I can and I do.

885
00:55:46,454 --> 00:55:49,556
Joffrey has made this
poor girl's life miserable

886
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:51,625
since the day he took
her father's head.

887
00:55:51,659 --> 00:55:54,694
Now she's finally free of
him and you give her to me?

888
00:55:54,728 --> 00:55:56,429
That's cruel even for you.

889
00:55:56,464 --> 00:55:58,331
Do you intend
on mistreating her?

890
00:55:58,366 --> 00:56:00,300
The girl's happiness
is not my concern,

891
00:56:00,335 --> 00:56:02,569
- nor should it be yours.
- She's a child!

892
00:56:02,604 --> 00:56:05,473
She's flowered, I assure you.
She and I have discussed it at length.

893
00:56:05,507 --> 00:56:09,010
There, you see? You will wed her,
bed her, and put a child in her.

894
00:56:09,044 --> 00:56:12,080
- <i>Surely you're capable of that.</i>
- And if I refuse?

895
00:56:12,115 --> 00:56:14,784
You wanted to be rewarded
for your valor in battle.

896
00:56:14,818 --> 00:56:18,821
Sansa Stark is a finer reward than
you could ever dare hope for.

897
00:56:18,855 --> 00:56:21,357
And it is past time
you were wed.

898
00:56:21,391 --> 00:56:24,226
I was wed.

899
00:56:24,261 --> 00:56:26,829
Or don't you remember?

900
00:56:28,265 --> 00:56:30,399
Only too well.

901
00:56:30,434 --> 00:56:33,803
<i>You should be thanking</i>
<i>the gods for this.</i>

902
00:56:33,837 --> 00:56:35,471
This is more
than you deserve.

903
00:56:35,506 --> 00:56:37,974
<i>Tyrion will do as he's bid.</i>

904
00:56:38,008 --> 00:56:40,076
As will you.

905
00:56:41,478 --> 00:56:43,579
What do you mean?

906
00:56:43,614 --> 00:56:45,481
You'll marry Ser Loras.

907
00:56:47,651 --> 00:56:50,086
- I will not.
- The boy is heir to Highgarden.

908
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,589
Tyrion will secure the North,
you will secure the Reach.

909
00:56:52,623 --> 00:56:55,359
- No, I won't do it.
- Yes, you will.

910
00:56:55,393 --> 00:56:58,095
You're still fertile.
You need to marry again and breed.

911
00:56:58,129 --> 00:57:00,297
I am Queen Regent,
not some broodmare.

912
00:57:00,331 --> 00:57:03,000
You're my daughter!

913
00:57:03,034 --> 00:57:04,669
You will do as I command

914
00:57:04,703 --> 00:57:06,938
and you will marry
Loras Tyrell

915
00:57:06,972 --> 00:57:09,307
and put an end
to the disgusting rumors

916
00:57:09,341 --> 00:57:12,143
about you
once and for all.

917
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:14,279
Father, don't make me
do it again, please.

918
00:57:14,313 --> 00:57:16,849
Not another word.

919
00:57:16,883 --> 00:57:19,951
My children.

920
00:57:19,986 --> 00:57:23,889
You've disgraced the Lannister
name for far too long.
