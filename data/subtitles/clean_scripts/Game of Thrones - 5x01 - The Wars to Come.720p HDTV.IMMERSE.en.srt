1
00:04:21,004 --> 00:04:23,670
- We shouldn't be out here alone.
- Why not?

2
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:26,378
- If your father--
- He'll never know we're gone.

3
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:28,446
But if he finds out...

4
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,963
You don't need
to be afraid of my father.

5
00:05:02,088 --> 00:05:04,503
Are you sure?

6
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,295
Yes.

7
00:05:06,296 --> 00:05:09,504
- We shouldn't go in.
- Of course we should.

8
00:05:53,713 --> 00:05:56,962
Get out.
Get out!

9
00:05:56,963 --> 00:05:58,920
- Let's go.
- No.

10
00:05:58,921 --> 00:06:00,696
Listen to your friend.

11
00:06:02,046 --> 00:06:03,753
They said that you
were terrifying

12
00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:07,837
with cat's teeth and three eyes.

13
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:09,713
You're not terrifying.

14
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:13,212
You're boring.

15
00:06:13,213 --> 00:06:15,314
You don't know what I am.

16
00:06:15,434 --> 00:06:18,832
I know you're a witch
and you can see the future.

17
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,128
Tell me mine.

18
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:24,420
Everyone wants
to know their future

19
00:06:24,421 --> 00:06:26,545
until they know their future.

20
00:06:26,546 --> 00:06:29,920
This is my father's land.
My land.

21
00:06:29,921 --> 00:06:34,965
Tell me my future or I'll have your two
boring eyes gouged out of your head.

22
00:06:44,603 --> 00:06:47,212
Your blood.

23
00:06:47,213 --> 00:06:48,754
Give me a taste.

24
00:07:14,088 --> 00:07:16,035
Three questions you get.

25
00:07:16,596 --> 00:07:19,046
You won't like the answers.

26
00:07:22,713 --> 00:07:25,420
I've been promised
to the prince.

27
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:28,545
When will we marry?

28
00:07:28,546 --> 00:07:30,221
You will never wed the prince.

29
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,212
You will wed the king.

30
00:07:32,213 --> 00:07:33,670
But I will be queen?

31
00:07:33,671 --> 00:07:36,087
Oh, yes.

32
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,420
You'll be queen.

33
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:40,295
For a time.

34
00:07:40,296 --> 00:07:43,378
Then comes another,

35
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,878
younger,

36
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,503
<i>more beautiful,</i>

37
00:07:47,504 --> 00:07:50,795
<i>to cast you down
and take all you hold dear.</i>

38
00:07:50,796 --> 00:07:54,003
W-will the king and I
have children?

39
00:07:54,004 --> 00:07:59,399
No. The king will have 20
children and you will have three.

40
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,503
That doesn't make sense.

41
00:08:00,504 --> 00:08:03,962
Gold will be their crowns.

42
00:08:03,963 --> 00:08:06,838
Gold their shrouds.

43
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:15,670
Come on, we have to go.

44
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:19,128
We have to go!
Cersei!

45
00:08:23,088 --> 00:08:25,087
<i>Bearers, put it down.</i>

46
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:43,795
<i>Bearers, up.</i>

47
00:08:43,796 --> 00:08:45,546
<i>Away.</i>

48
00:08:59,213 --> 00:09:01,962
<i>Your Grace, we are
honored by your presence.</i>

49
00:09:01,963 --> 00:09:03,378
<i>The mourners are waiting.</i>

50
00:09:03,498 --> 00:09:05,893
They will keep waiting.

51
00:09:05,997 --> 00:09:07,746
I want a moment alone with him.

52
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,205
But, Your Grace, many of these lords
and ladies have travelled

53
00:09:10,206 --> 00:09:12,371
day and night to be here from
all seven kingdoms.

54
00:09:12,372 --> 00:09:14,122
They will wait.

55
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,496
He never wanted you
to be a Kingsguard,

56
00:09:43,497 --> 00:09:47,247
but here you are,
protecting his dead body.

57
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:52,997
What he built, it's ours.

58
00:09:54,206 --> 00:09:57,122
He built it for us.
He meant it for us.

59
00:09:59,372 --> 00:10:00,871
They're going to try
to take it away.

60
00:10:00,872 --> 00:10:02,246
- All of it.
- They?

61
00:10:02,247 --> 00:10:03,955
All of them out there,
our enemies.

62
00:10:03,956 --> 00:10:06,746
They're waiting in line to make sure
he's really dead.

63
00:10:06,747 --> 00:10:09,538
And as soon as they see
the stones on his eyes,

64
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:11,371
they'll set to work
on tearing us apart.

65
00:10:11,372 --> 00:10:14,121
They have nothing to do with it.

66
00:10:14,122 --> 00:10:16,413
The man who murdered our father,
he tore us apart.

67
00:10:16,414 --> 00:10:18,746
He's the enemy.
I've been telling you for years.

68
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:19,788
You've been defending
him for years.

69
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:21,955
This is exactly what they want.

70
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:23,580
And now our father is dead

71
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:27,039
and that little monster
is out there somewhere drawing breath.

72
00:10:29,164 --> 00:10:31,331
Did you set him free?

73
00:10:33,956 --> 00:10:35,663
Tyrion may be a monster,

74
00:10:35,664 --> 00:10:39,663
but at least he killed
our father on purpose.

75
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:41,788
You killed him by mistake.

76
00:10:41,789 --> 00:10:43,581
With stupidity.

77
00:10:45,081 --> 00:10:46,496
You're a man
of action, aren't you?

78
00:10:46,497 --> 00:10:49,038
When it occurs to you
to do something, you do it.

79
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,039
Never mind the consequences.

80
00:10:53,997 --> 00:10:56,705
Take a look.

81
00:10:56,706 --> 00:10:57,706
Look at the consequences.

82
00:11:00,706 --> 00:11:02,539
Here they are.

83
00:11:06,414 --> 00:11:09,706
He loved you more than
anyone in this world.

84
00:12:41,956 --> 00:12:43,789
Apologies.

85
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:57,163
I still don't see
why I had to stay

86
00:12:57,164 --> 00:12:59,246
in this fucking crate
once we set sail.

87
00:12:59,247 --> 00:13:02,163
I saved your life.

88
00:13:02,164 --> 00:13:04,913
If they catch you,
they catch me.

89
00:13:04,914 --> 00:13:06,955
I cannot say
I feel overly guilty

90
00:13:06,956 --> 00:13:09,038
about leaving you
in that fucking crate.

91
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,746
Do you know what it's like
to stuff your shit

92
00:13:11,747 --> 00:13:13,413
through one of those airholes?

93
00:13:13,414 --> 00:13:14,705
No, I only know what it's like

94
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:17,872
to pick up your shit
and throw it overboard.

95
00:13:21,206 --> 00:13:23,496
Pentos?

96
00:13:23,497 --> 00:13:25,955
The home of my colleague
Illyrio Mopatis,

97
00:13:25,956 --> 00:13:28,330
a merchant.

98
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:30,288
He and I met many years ago

99
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:31,705
through mutual friends.

100
00:13:31,706 --> 00:13:35,080
A group of people
who saw Robert Baratheon

101
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,538
for the disaster he was.

102
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:39,580
We tried to do what
was best for the realm

103
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:43,121
by supporting
a Targaryen restoration.

104
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,746
And thus began
the chain of mistakes

105
00:13:45,747 --> 00:13:48,371
that has led us both here.

106
00:13:48,372 --> 00:13:51,830
Things have gotten worse,
not better.

107
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,914
Westeros needs to be
saved from itself.

108
00:13:58,664 --> 00:14:00,538
Mmm.

109
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:01,996
Much better.

110
00:14:01,997 --> 00:14:03,664
My lord?

111
00:14:05,706 --> 00:14:08,538
I don't think I am anymore.

112
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:10,747
A lord.

113
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:20,539
Are you a lord
if you kill your father?

114
00:14:22,914 --> 00:14:26,580
I don't imagine
they revoke your nobility

115
00:14:26,581 --> 00:14:28,538
for killing a whore.

116
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:30,455
It must happen all the time.

117
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:32,871
You already drank yourself
across the Narrow Sea.

118
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,455
In a box.
Why stop now?

119
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:37,872
Because we are talking
about the future of our country.

120
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:44,456
The future is shit.

121
00:14:46,664 --> 00:14:48,539
Just like the past.

122
00:16:40,586 --> 00:16:41,918
_

123
00:16:42,038 --> 00:16:44,392
_

124
00:16:55,674 --> 00:16:56,600
_

125
00:16:57,063 --> 00:16:58,452
_

126
00:16:58,965 --> 00:17:00,609
_

127
00:17:08,706 --> 00:17:09,913
Shh.

128
00:17:09,914 --> 00:17:11,622
Shh.

129
00:17:56,122 --> 00:17:57,913
<i>The Sons of the Harpy?</i>

130
00:17:57,914 --> 00:18:00,246
Yes, Your Grace.
They left it on the body.

131
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,580
They've never killed before.

132
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,080
It was only a matter
of time, Your Grace.

133
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:06,580
Conquerors always meet
with resistance.

134
00:18:06,581 --> 00:18:08,663
I didn't conquer them.
Their own people did.

135
00:18:09,074 --> 00:18:12,541
_

136
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:16,877
_

137
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:19,746
He did not risk his life
fighting for his freedom

138
00:18:19,747 --> 00:18:21,746
so cowards in masks
could take it away.

139
00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:23,246
And I did not take up
residence in this pyramid

140
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:26,705
so I could watch the city below
decline into chaos.

141
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:29,246
What was the name
of the man you lost?

142
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,705
White Rat, Your Grace.

143
00:18:32,706 --> 00:18:36,871
I want him buried
with honor, publically

144
00:18:36,872 --> 00:18:39,288
in the Temple of the Graces.

145
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:41,330
The Sons of the Harpy
will hear that message.

146
00:18:41,331 --> 00:18:43,038
Make them very angry.

147
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,996
Angry snakes lash out.

148
00:18:44,997 --> 00:18:47,705
Makes chopping off their heads
that much easier.

149
00:18:47,706 --> 00:18:51,122
Find the men who did this
and bring them to me.

150
00:18:54,497 --> 00:18:55,497
Your Grace.

151
00:19:09,997 --> 00:19:11,996
Torgo Nudho.

152
00:19:11,997 --> 00:19:13,872
Missandei hin Naath.

153
00:19:16,164 --> 00:19:17,456
I wanted to speak with you.

154
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:28,621
Why do you come?

155
00:19:28,622 --> 00:19:31,581
White Rat, the Unsullied who...

156
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:37,081
I have heard they found
his body in a brothel.

157
00:19:38,331 --> 00:19:41,246
I have heard that
more than one Unsullied

158
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:43,914
has been known to visit
Meereen's brothels.

159
00:19:46,914 --> 00:19:48,414
May I ask you why?

160
00:19:50,164 --> 00:19:52,497
Why would an Unsullied
go to a brothel?

161
00:19:56,081 --> 00:19:58,997
I do not know.

162
00:19:59,914 --> 00:20:02,539
<i>I must go.</i>

163
00:20:17,622 --> 00:20:19,746
- Get your shield up.
- It's too heavy.

164
00:20:19,747 --> 00:20:22,038
If it wasn't heavy,
it wouldn't stop a sword.

165
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:23,581
Now get it up.

166
00:20:35,247 --> 00:20:38,746
Come.
Try it again.

167
00:20:38,747 --> 00:20:41,871
Drive at me.
Keep your shield up.

168
00:20:41,872 --> 00:20:44,330
Or I'll ring
your head like a bell.

169
00:20:44,331 --> 00:20:47,121
Shouldn't you be training, too?

170
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:49,622
Well, I'm hardly a new recruit.

171
00:20:52,914 --> 00:20:55,455
How many brothers can say that they've
killed a white walker and a Thenn?

172
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:58,580
I might be the first in history.

173
00:20:58,581 --> 00:21:00,496
<i>- Shield up.
- These men need a firm hand.</i>

174
00:21:00,497 --> 00:21:02,246
Always have.

175
00:21:02,247 --> 00:21:04,414
They're poachers and thieves.

176
00:21:07,081 --> 00:21:08,997
Not soldiers.

177
00:21:14,831 --> 00:21:16,581
That one hates me.

178
00:21:18,706 --> 00:21:20,913
If Ser Alliser
is chosen as the new Lord Commander...

179
00:21:20,914 --> 00:21:24,580
He hates the wildlings.

180
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:26,371
All the wildlings.

181
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:28,955
<i>- Don't let them send us away.
-  It's not a sure thing.</i>

182
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:31,496
Ser Denys Mallister has
commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years

183
00:21:31,497 --> 00:21:33,330
and people say he's a good man.

184
00:21:33,331 --> 00:21:34,455
He's running against
Ser Alliser--

185
00:21:34,456 --> 00:21:37,080
Sam, don't let them
send us away.

186
00:21:37,081 --> 00:21:38,330
I told you.

187
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:41,455
Wherever you go, I go, too.

188
00:21:41,456 --> 00:21:43,747
You can't leave.
They'll execute you.

189
00:21:51,747 --> 00:21:53,707
- Good, good, pivot. Don't forget to pivot.
- Yah!

190
00:21:55,372 --> 00:21:56,456
Shield up.

191
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,914
The king wants a word.

192
00:22:28,372 --> 00:22:30,538
You're not cold, my lady?

193
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:32,705
Never.

194
00:22:32,706 --> 00:22:36,706
The Lord's fire lives
within me, Jon Snow.

195
00:22:39,456 --> 00:22:41,247
Feel.

196
00:22:48,497 --> 00:22:50,331
Are you a virgin?

197
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,872
No.

198
00:22:57,456 --> 00:22:59,331
Good.

199
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:08,496
Your Grace.

200
00:23:08,497 --> 00:23:10,706
The bastard of Winterfell.

201
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:21,539
You know who rules
at Winterfell now?

202
00:23:22,706 --> 00:23:24,496
Roose Bolton.

203
00:23:24,497 --> 00:23:27,789
Mmm, the traitor who plunged a dagger
in Robb Stark's heart.

204
00:23:28,747 --> 00:23:31,331
Don't you want to avenge him?

205
00:23:32,664 --> 00:23:35,663
I want a great
many things, Your Grace.

206
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,163
But I'm a sworn brother
of the Night's Watch now.

207
00:23:38,164 --> 00:23:41,496
I've been talking
to your sworn brothers.

208
00:23:41,497 --> 00:23:43,205
- Many of them love you.
- They're good men.

209
00:23:43,206 --> 00:23:44,913
<i>Many don't.</i>

210
00:23:44,914 --> 00:23:48,913
You were seen taking the body
of a wildling girl north of the Wall.

211
00:23:48,914 --> 00:23:50,580
<i>Why?</i>

212
00:23:50,581 --> 00:23:51,788
It's where she belonged.

213
00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:54,205
Some of the Night's
Watch feel you have

214
00:23:54,206 --> 00:23:56,163
too much affection
for the wildlings.

215
00:23:56,164 --> 00:23:58,580
They were born on the
wrong side of the Wall.

216
00:23:58,581 --> 00:24:00,621
That doesn't make them monsters.

217
00:24:00,622 --> 00:24:01,913
No matter.

218
00:24:01,914 --> 00:24:02,913
I shall take back the North

219
00:24:02,914 --> 00:24:04,830
from the thieves who stole it.

220
00:24:04,831 --> 00:24:07,413
Tywin Lannister is dead.
He can't protect them now.

221
00:24:07,414 --> 00:24:10,996
I shall mount Roose Bolton's
head on a spike.

222
00:24:10,997 --> 00:24:13,705
But if I'm to take Winterfell,
I need more men.

223
00:24:13,706 --> 00:24:15,705
The men of the Night's Watch
are sworn to play no part--

224
00:24:15,706 --> 00:24:18,705
I'm not talking about
the damn Night's Watch.

225
00:24:18,706 --> 00:24:20,456
I'm talking about the wildlings.

226
00:24:28,456 --> 00:24:32,580
Your Grace,
you want the wildlings

227
00:24:32,581 --> 00:24:34,580
to march in your army?

228
00:24:34,581 --> 00:24:35,871
If they swear to follow me,
I'll pardon them.

229
00:24:35,872 --> 00:24:38,455
We'll take Winterfell.
Once the North is won,

230
00:24:38,456 --> 00:24:39,371
I'll declare them
citizens of the realm.

231
00:24:39,372 --> 00:24:41,580
I'll give them land to live on.

232
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:45,746
It's a fair offer.
More than fair.

233
00:24:45,747 --> 00:24:47,705
I'll offer them their lives
and their freedom

234
00:24:47,706 --> 00:24:50,746
if Mance kneels before me
and swears his loyalty.

235
00:24:50,747 --> 00:24:51,868
I don't think that's likely.

236
00:24:54,706 --> 00:24:56,121
You admire him, don't you?

237
00:24:56,122 --> 00:24:58,871
- I respect him.
- He likes you.

238
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,788
- Convince him to bend the knee...
- Your Grace.

239
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:02,122
...or he burns.

240
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:07,496
How much time do I have?

241
00:25:07,497 --> 00:25:09,163
Nightfall.

242
00:25:09,164 --> 00:25:11,455
The sun drops fast
this time of year.

243
00:25:11,456 --> 00:25:13,121
<i>Hurry, Jon Snow.</i>

244
00:25:16,747 --> 00:25:18,330
<i>Shield up.</i>

245
00:25:18,331 --> 00:25:21,163
<i>Attack, my lord!</i>

246
00:25:21,164 --> 00:25:22,538
Attack!

247
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:26,163
Don't cross your feet.

248
00:25:26,164 --> 00:25:27,913
My sons had swords
in their hands

249
00:25:27,914 --> 00:25:29,538
from the time they could walk.
This one...

250
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:31,705
<i>Lord Arryn will never
be a great warrior.</i>

251
00:25:31,706 --> 00:25:33,705
<i>Great warrior?</i>

252
00:25:33,706 --> 00:25:36,330
He swings a sword
like a girl with palsy.

253
00:25:36,331 --> 00:25:39,246
My lord.

254
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:41,121
<i>Sword up, my lord!</i>

255
00:25:48,622 --> 00:25:50,496
Some boys develop more slowly.

256
00:25:50,497 --> 00:25:52,788
He's still young.

257
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:55,913
He's 13.
Boys go to war at 13.

258
00:25:55,914 --> 00:25:57,955
- He has other gifts.
- Does he?

259
00:25:57,956 --> 00:26:00,746
The gift of a great name.

260
00:26:00,747 --> 00:26:04,496
Sometimes that's all one needs.

261
00:26:09,456 --> 00:26:12,205
Good-bye, Lord Royce, and thank you
for all you've done for me.

262
00:26:12,206 --> 00:26:14,621
I have done nothing more
than my duty, my lady.

263
00:26:14,622 --> 00:26:15,955
I have no doubt
that on my return,

264
00:26:15,956 --> 00:26:18,913
Robin's skills will have
improved immeasurably.

265
00:26:18,914 --> 00:26:20,080
He'll be safe here.

266
00:26:20,081 --> 00:26:24,038
<i>As for his skills,</i>

267
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:26,247
I make no promises.

268
00:26:39,206 --> 00:26:42,413
Will we head north
at some point?

269
00:26:42,414 --> 00:26:45,705
He said Sansa had a brother
at Castle Black.

270
00:26:45,706 --> 00:26:47,330
We're a few days' ride
from the Kingsroad.

271
00:26:47,331 --> 00:26:50,414
- But that will take us--
- Us?

272
00:26:52,664 --> 00:26:54,955
The only reason you're here
is because Jaime Lannister

273
00:26:54,956 --> 00:26:56,622
told me you weren't
safe in the capital.

274
00:26:58,747 --> 00:27:01,705
You're hundreds of miles
from King's Landing.

275
00:27:01,706 --> 00:27:03,705
No one knows what you look like.

276
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:06,121
No one cares.
You're safe.

277
00:27:06,122 --> 00:27:09,622
- But I'm your squire.
- Do you even know what a squire is?

278
00:27:11,414 --> 00:27:12,205
An attendant to a knight.

279
00:27:12,206 --> 00:27:14,830
I'm not a knight.

280
00:27:14,831 --> 00:27:17,080
That means you're not a squire.

281
00:27:17,081 --> 00:27:18,163
Well, where would I go?

282
00:27:18,164 --> 00:27:21,039
I don't care.
I'm not your mother.

283
00:27:29,706 --> 00:27:31,830
You swore to find
the Stark girls.

284
00:27:31,831 --> 00:27:34,621
I found Arya. She didn't want
my protection.

285
00:27:34,622 --> 00:27:36,831
<i>-  Sansa still might.
- Will you shut your mouth?</i>

286
00:27:37,997 --> 00:27:39,831
I didn't ask for your advice.

287
00:27:41,664 --> 00:27:44,496
I don't want anyone
following me.

288
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,413
I'm not a leader.

289
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:49,413
All I ever wanted
was to fight for a lord I believed in.

290
00:27:49,414 --> 00:27:52,331
The good lords are dead
and the rest are monsters.

291
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:05,580
You told Lord Royce
we were going to the Fingers.

292
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:07,788
I did.

293
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:10,913
- But we're heading west.
- We are.

294
00:28:10,914 --> 00:28:12,872
If he wanted to betray us,
he already would have.

295
00:28:14,414 --> 00:28:18,163
Lord Royce might be as honorable
as he thinks he is,

296
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:20,538
but he's not alone
in that castle.

297
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:21,621
Do you trust all those
knights and ladies,

298
00:28:21,622 --> 00:28:24,830
<i>stable boys and serving girls?</i>

299
00:28:24,831 --> 00:28:27,788
No, do you trust the carriage driver
or the knights escorting us?

300
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,246
No.

301
00:28:29,247 --> 00:28:31,871
But I pay them well

302
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:34,163
and they've seen what happens
to men who disappoint me.

303
00:28:34,164 --> 00:28:36,538
So where are we going?

304
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:38,955
To a land where
you trust everyone?

305
00:28:38,956 --> 00:28:41,705
To a land so far from here,

306
00:28:41,706 --> 00:28:43,626
even Cersei Lannister
can't get her hands on you.

307
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:55,581
It was such a deep,
deep shock to us all.

308
00:28:59,122 --> 00:29:00,288
Your father was a--

309
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:03,246
a force to be reckoned with.

310
00:29:03,247 --> 00:29:04,455
He truly was.

311
00:29:04,456 --> 00:29:07,621
I wouldn't presume to claim

312
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:09,955
to have known him
as such, but--

313
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:13,496
<i>but just being in his presence was enough
to make it so clear</i>

314
00:29:13,497 --> 00:29:15,663
just how formidable
a person you were dealing with.

315
00:29:15,664 --> 00:29:19,038
What a-- what a force
to be reckoned with.

316
00:29:21,581 --> 00:29:23,956
Thank you so much
for your kind words.

317
00:29:28,622 --> 00:29:31,163
Deepest condolences, Your Grace.

318
00:29:31,164 --> 00:29:33,205
This tragedy...
I never trusted Varys.

319
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:36,247
I often warned...

320
00:29:38,956 --> 00:29:41,081
Your Grace.

321
00:29:43,831 --> 00:29:46,330
Cousin Lancel.
I hardly recognized you.

322
00:29:46,331 --> 00:29:48,621
My deepest sympathies.

323
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:51,746
I apologize
for my son's appearance.

324
00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:52,868
Uncle, it's quite all right.

325
00:29:56,289 --> 00:29:58,330
They call themselves sparrows.

326
00:29:58,331 --> 00:30:01,038
Bloody fanatics.

327
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,038
Religion has its place,
of course,

328
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,871
but at a certain point...

329
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:08,830
They never would have come to the capital
when Tywin was alive.

330
00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:10,496
I'm sure he'll grow out of it,

331
00:30:10,497 --> 00:30:12,496
whatever it is.

332
00:30:12,497 --> 00:30:15,039
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

333
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:36,163
Your wounds from the Blackwater
seem to have healed.

334
00:30:36,164 --> 00:30:38,539
It wasn't my wounds
that needed healing.

335
00:30:41,247 --> 00:30:44,164
What can I do for you?

336
00:30:45,164 --> 00:30:47,413
You can forgive me.

337
00:30:47,414 --> 00:30:50,246
What could you possibly
have done to warrant my forgiveness?

338
00:30:50,247 --> 00:30:52,955
I led you into the darkness.

339
00:30:52,956 --> 00:30:54,371
I doubt you've ever
led anyone anywhere.

340
00:30:54,372 --> 00:30:57,163
I tempted you into our...

341
00:30:57,164 --> 00:31:00,414
unnatural relations.

342
00:31:01,956 --> 00:31:04,414
And, of course,
there was the king...

343
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,831
his boar hunt.

344
00:31:10,831 --> 00:31:11,914
His wine.

345
00:31:15,581 --> 00:31:17,455
I don't know what
you're talking about.

346
00:31:17,456 --> 00:31:20,706
I'm a different person now.

347
00:31:22,497 --> 00:31:25,246
I've found peace
in the light of the Seven.

348
00:31:25,247 --> 00:31:26,913
<i>You can, too.</i>

349
00:31:26,914 --> 00:31:28,538
<i>They watch over all of us,</i>

350
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:31,080
ready to dole out mercy

351
00:31:31,081 --> 00:31:32,581
or justice.

352
00:31:35,456 --> 00:31:38,331
Their world is at hand.

353
00:31:41,081 --> 00:31:42,746
I will pray for
your father's soul.

354
00:31:45,331 --> 00:31:48,914
The day Tywin Lannister's
soul needs your help...

355
00:31:57,747 --> 00:32:00,205
- It looks like Dorne.
- It doesn't.

356
00:32:00,206 --> 00:32:03,121
It does.

357
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:07,247
That's the--
that's the Sunspear bit right there.

358
00:32:08,456 --> 00:32:10,163
And that's where
the mountains are.

359
00:32:10,164 --> 00:32:13,496
And over here is--

360
00:32:13,497 --> 00:32:16,288
is Sunsnake?

361
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:16,913
Stonespear?

362
00:32:16,914 --> 00:32:19,413
Sandstone.

363
00:32:19,414 --> 00:32:20,996
Yes.

364
00:32:20,997 --> 00:32:23,413
Yes, Sandstone.

365
00:32:24,831 --> 00:32:26,163
Just there.

366
00:32:26,164 --> 00:32:28,164
Fine.

367
00:32:30,872 --> 00:32:31,539
It's Dorne.

368
00:32:33,831 --> 00:32:36,038
We should go there.

369
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:38,413
I think we would
have a lovely time,

370
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,788
judging by my experience.

371
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:45,538
That would be wonderful.
Dorne, Highgarden.

372
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:47,081
Anywhere but here.

373
00:32:56,206 --> 00:32:58,122
We're late for dinner as it is.

374
00:32:58,914 --> 00:33:00,538
You're very respectful.

375
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:01,414
I'm very hungry.

376
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:21,871
What's your name?

377
00:33:21,872 --> 00:33:23,538
Olyvar, my lady.

378
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:25,371
I'm afraid my brother

379
00:33:25,372 --> 00:33:28,831
is keeping the king
waiting, Olyvar.

380
00:33:37,706 --> 00:33:39,539
My lady.

381
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:55,788
Perhaps you might
consider being a bit more discreet?

382
00:33:55,789 --> 00:33:57,538
Why?

383
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:59,871
They all know about me anyway.

384
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:03,163
Everybody knows everything
about everyone.

385
00:34:03,164 --> 00:34:06,330
What's the point in trying to
keep a secret in a place like this?

386
00:34:06,331 --> 00:34:09,622
In any event, you shouldn't
keep your intended waiting.

387
00:34:10,331 --> 00:34:13,038
My intended?
Please.

388
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:14,455
<i>Tywin's dead.</i>

389
00:34:14,456 --> 00:34:16,871
<i>That means no one
can force Cersei to marry me.</i>

390
00:34:16,872 --> 00:34:19,080
- Lucky you.
- Unlucky you.

391
00:34:19,081 --> 00:34:20,538
You think I want that woman
married to my brother?

392
00:34:20,539 --> 00:34:24,621
If she doesn't marry me,
she doesn't go to Highgarden.

393
00:34:24,622 --> 00:34:27,330
Which means she stays
in King's Landing.

394
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:29,913
<i>Which means you're trapped here with
Cersei Lannister as your mother by law.</i>

395
00:34:29,914 --> 00:34:31,497
Perhaps.

396
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:35,580
Perhaps?

397
00:34:35,581 --> 00:34:36,414
Perhaps.

398
00:34:50,122 --> 00:34:53,996
Eunuch, the Spider, the
Master of Whisperers.

399
00:34:53,997 --> 00:34:57,289
Imp, Half-man.

400
00:34:59,622 --> 00:35:01,955
There are faster ways
to kill yourself.

401
00:35:01,956 --> 00:35:03,705
Not for a coward.

402
00:35:03,706 --> 00:35:05,746
You are many things, my friend,

403
00:35:05,747 --> 00:35:07,497
but not a coward.

404
00:35:11,456 --> 00:35:13,830
You never told me
why you set me free.

405
00:35:13,831 --> 00:35:16,830
Your brother asked me to.

406
00:35:16,831 --> 00:35:18,080
Could have said no.

407
00:35:18,081 --> 00:35:21,330
Refuse the Kingslayer?
A dangerous proposition.

408
00:35:21,331 --> 00:35:23,580
Not as dangerous
as releasing me.

409
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:26,288
You risked your life,
your position, everything.

410
00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:28,955
Why? You're not family.
You owe me nothing.

411
00:35:28,956 --> 00:35:30,538
I didn't do it for you.

412
00:35:30,539 --> 00:35:33,580
I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.

413
00:35:33,581 --> 00:35:36,830
A drunken dwarf will never be the savior
of the Seven Kingdoms.

414
00:35:36,831 --> 00:35:39,080
I don't believe in saviors.

415
00:35:39,081 --> 00:35:42,456
I believe men of talent
have a part to play in the war to come.

416
00:35:44,247 --> 00:35:45,871
You're going to have
to find another soldier.

417
00:35:45,872 --> 00:35:49,955
I'm done with Westeros
and Westeros is done with me.

418
00:35:49,956 --> 00:35:53,163
You have many
admirable qualities,

419
00:35:53,164 --> 00:35:54,538
self-pity is not
one of them.

420
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:56,830
Any fool with a bit of luck

421
00:35:56,831 --> 00:36:00,371
can find himself
born into power.

422
00:36:00,372 --> 00:36:04,038
But earning it for yourself,
that takes work.

423
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:06,580
I'm not well-suited
for work.

424
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,205
I think you are.

425
00:36:08,206 --> 00:36:10,288
You have your father's
instincts for politics.

426
00:36:10,289 --> 00:36:11,871
And you have compassion.

427
00:36:11,872 --> 00:36:15,080
Compassion? Yes.

428
00:36:15,081 --> 00:36:17,705
I killed my lover
with my bare hands.

429
00:36:17,706 --> 00:36:21,496
I shot my own father
with a crossbow.

430
00:36:21,497 --> 00:36:23,538
I never said you were perfect.

431
00:36:23,539 --> 00:36:27,496
What is it you want exactly?

432
00:36:27,497 --> 00:36:29,496
Peace.

433
00:36:29,497 --> 00:36:30,955
Prosperity.

434
00:36:30,956 --> 00:36:35,038
A land where the powerful
do not prey on the powerless.

435
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:37,496
Where the castles
are made of gingerbread

436
00:36:37,497 --> 00:36:39,996
and the moats are filled
with blackberry wine.

437
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:42,288
The powerful have always
preyed on the powerless.

438
00:36:42,289 --> 00:36:44,705
That's how they became powerful
in the first place.

439
00:36:44,706 --> 00:36:46,621
Perhaps.

440
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:50,205
And perhaps we've grown
so used to horror,

441
00:36:50,206 --> 00:36:51,831
we assume there's no other way.

442
00:36:52,914 --> 00:36:55,621
<i>If you sat on the Iron Throne,</i>

443
00:36:55,622 --> 00:36:57,788
<i>would you spread misery
throughout the land?</i>

444
00:36:57,789 --> 00:37:00,205
I will never sit
on the Iron Throne.

445
00:37:00,206 --> 00:37:02,621
<i>No, you won't.</i>

446
00:37:02,622 --> 00:37:04,996
<i>But you could help another
climb those steps</i>

447
00:37:04,997 --> 00:37:07,496
and take that seat.

448
00:37:07,497 --> 00:37:10,538
The Seven Kingdoms
need someone stronger than Tommen,

449
00:37:10,539 --> 00:37:12,830
but gentler than Stannis.

450
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:15,746
A monarch who can intimidate the
high lords and inspire the people.

451
00:37:15,747 --> 00:37:19,830
A ruler loved by millions
with a powerful army

452
00:37:19,831 --> 00:37:21,705
and the right family name.

453
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,996
Good luck finding him.

454
00:37:23,997 --> 00:37:27,039
Who said anything about "him"?

455
00:37:30,997 --> 00:37:33,371
You have a choice, my friend.

456
00:37:33,372 --> 00:37:35,371
You can stay here
at Illyrio's palace

457
00:37:35,372 --> 00:37:37,955
and drink yourself to death,

458
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:39,288
or you can ride with me
to Meereen,

459
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:41,746
meet Daenerys Targaryen,

460
00:37:41,747 --> 00:37:44,164
and decide if the world
is worth fighting for.

461
00:37:45,914 --> 00:37:50,247
Can I drink myself to death
on the road to Meereen?

462
00:38:00,289 --> 00:38:03,788
When did the Unsullied
start patrolling the streets of Meereen?

463
00:38:03,789 --> 00:38:06,622
Looks like your friends haven't
been behaving themselves.

464
00:38:08,956 --> 00:38:12,788
Our mission to Yunkai
was a resounding success.

465
00:38:12,789 --> 00:38:15,371
The Wise Masters of Yunkai
have agreed to cede power

466
00:38:15,372 --> 00:38:17,246
to a council of elders
made up of both

467
00:38:17,247 --> 00:38:19,663
the freed men and
the former slaveholders.

468
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,788
All matters of consequence will be
brought to you for review.

469
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:23,538
Good.

470
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:26,080
They did ask
for some concessions.

471
00:38:26,081 --> 00:38:27,830
Concessions?

472
00:38:27,831 --> 00:38:30,913
Politics is the art
of compromise, Your Grace.

473
00:38:30,914 --> 00:38:33,830
I'm not a politician.
I'm a queen.

474
00:38:33,831 --> 00:38:37,080
<i>Forgive me.
You're right, of course.</i>

475
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:41,496
Still, it's easier to rule happy
subjects than angry ones.

476
00:38:41,497 --> 00:38:43,496
I don't expect
the Wise Masters to be happy.

477
00:38:43,497 --> 00:38:45,871
Slavery made them rich.
I ended slavery.

478
00:38:45,872 --> 00:38:48,955
They do not ask
for the return of slavery.

479
00:38:48,956 --> 00:38:51,539
They ask for the reopening
of the fighting pits.

480
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,205
The fighting pits?

481
00:38:55,206 --> 00:38:56,705
Where slaves fought
slaves to the death?

482
00:38:56,706 --> 00:38:59,580
In the new world
that you've brought to us,

483
00:38:59,581 --> 00:39:01,914
free men would fight free men.

484
00:39:03,414 --> 00:39:04,830
<i>The pit fighters you liberated</i>

485
00:39:04,831 --> 00:39:06,913
<i>plead for this opportunity.</i>

486
00:39:06,914 --> 00:39:09,246
Bring some here
and ask them yourself.

487
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:10,455
No fighting pits.

488
00:39:10,456 --> 00:39:11,788
Opening them would show
the people of Yunkai

489
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:14,746
and Meereen that you
respect their traditions.

490
00:39:14,747 --> 00:39:17,163
I do not respect the tradition of
human cockfighting.

491
00:39:17,164 --> 00:39:20,414
- If you-- - How many times must I say no
before you understand?

492
00:39:22,831 --> 00:39:26,205
Whatever he wants from me,
he's not going to get it.

493
00:39:26,206 --> 00:39:28,746
If he really believes
I'm going to reopen the fighting pits...

494
00:39:28,747 --> 00:39:30,913
You should reopen
the fighting pits.

495
00:39:30,914 --> 00:39:33,788
What?

496
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,414
My mother was a whore.
I told you that.

497
00:39:37,497 --> 00:39:40,163
She liked to drink pear brandy.

498
00:39:40,164 --> 00:39:44,246
The older she got, the less
she made selling her body,

499
00:39:44,247 --> 00:39:46,621
the more she wanted to drink.

500
00:39:46,622 --> 00:39:49,830
So one day when I was 12,
she sold me to a slaver

501
00:39:49,831 --> 00:39:52,455
she fucked the night before.

502
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:54,746
I'm sorry.

503
00:39:54,747 --> 00:39:57,496
Why?
I was a bad child.

504
00:39:57,497 --> 00:40:00,288
I wasn't big, but I was quick.

505
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:02,580
And I loved to fight.

506
00:40:02,581 --> 00:40:04,580
So they sold me
to a man in Tolos

507
00:40:04,581 --> 00:40:06,746
who trained fighters
for the pits.

508
00:40:06,747 --> 00:40:09,371
I had my first match
when I was 16.

509
00:40:09,372 --> 00:40:11,538
You were sold into slavery,

510
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:13,996
forced to fight to the death
for the amusement of the masters,

511
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:15,517
and you're defending
the fighting pits?

512
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,996
I'm only here
because of those pits.

513
00:40:19,997 --> 00:40:22,621
I learned to fight
like a Dothraki screamer,

514
00:40:22,622 --> 00:40:24,038
a Norvoshi priest,
a Westerosi knight.

515
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:26,663
Soon I was famous.

516
00:40:26,664 --> 00:40:28,913
10,000 men and women
screamed my name

517
00:40:28,914 --> 00:40:29,996
when I stepped into the pit.

518
00:40:29,997 --> 00:40:31,496
I made so much money
for my master,

519
00:40:31,497 --> 00:40:34,288
he set me free when he died.

520
00:40:34,289 --> 00:40:36,080
I joined the Second Sons.

521
00:40:36,081 --> 00:40:38,997
And then I met you.

522
00:40:44,497 --> 00:40:45,830
You're the queen.

523
00:40:45,831 --> 00:40:49,371
Everyone's too afraid
of you to speak truth.

524
00:40:49,372 --> 00:40:51,955
Everyone but me.

525
00:40:51,956 --> 00:40:56,163
You've made thousands
of enemies all across the world.

526
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:58,955
As soon as they see weakness,

527
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,205
they'll attack.

528
00:41:01,206 --> 00:41:04,746
Show your strength here, now.

529
00:41:04,747 --> 00:41:06,908
That's why I have the Unsullied
patrolling the streets.

530
00:41:09,122 --> 00:41:12,663
Anyone with a chest
full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied.

531
00:41:12,664 --> 00:41:16,413
You're not
the Mother of Unsullied.

532
00:41:16,414 --> 00:41:17,574
You're the Mother of Dragons.

533
00:41:25,247 --> 00:41:29,122
I don't want another child's bones
dropped at my feet.

534
00:41:30,122 --> 00:41:32,996
No one's seen Drogon in weeks.

535
00:41:32,997 --> 00:41:35,456
For all I know, he's flown halfway
across the world.

536
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,539
I can't control them anymore.

537
00:41:43,956 --> 00:41:47,496
A dragon queen with no dragons

538
00:41:47,497 --> 00:41:48,622
is not a queen.

539
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,331
Viserion?

540
00:42:59,331 --> 00:43:01,206
Rhaegal?

541
00:43:13,206 --> 00:43:14,746
Easy. Easy.

542
00:43:14,747 --> 00:43:16,913
Easy.

543
00:43:56,331 --> 00:43:58,538
So here we are.

544
00:43:58,539 --> 00:43:59,622
Here we are.

545
00:44:02,414 --> 00:44:06,205
When we first met,
you were my prisoner.

546
00:44:06,206 --> 00:44:08,414
And now, for our last meeting...

547
00:44:10,747 --> 00:44:14,205
This doesn't have to be
our last meeting.

548
00:44:14,206 --> 00:44:16,622
No, but it will be.

549
00:44:19,164 --> 00:44:21,496
You know what Stannis wants?

550
00:44:21,497 --> 00:44:24,038
He wants me to bend the knee.

551
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:26,413
And he wants the free folk
to fight for him.

552
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:29,621
I'll give him this much,

553
00:44:29,622 --> 00:44:30,955
he's bold.

554
00:44:30,956 --> 00:44:32,496
Shouldn't a king be bold?

555
00:44:32,497 --> 00:44:34,580
<i>Oh, aye.</i>

556
00:44:34,581 --> 00:44:37,705
I respect him.

557
00:44:37,706 --> 00:44:39,246
If he gets what he wants,

558
00:44:39,247 --> 00:44:40,955
I expect he'll be a better ruler
than the fools

559
00:44:40,956 --> 00:44:44,871
sitting on the Iron Throne
the last hundred years.

560
00:44:44,872 --> 00:44:47,331
But I'll never serve him.

561
00:44:48,581 --> 00:44:50,371
You told me you weren't
here to conquer.

562
00:44:50,372 --> 00:44:51,705
You told me your people
have bled enough.

563
00:44:51,706 --> 00:44:53,330
That's right.

564
00:44:53,331 --> 00:44:56,621
I don't want them bleeding for
Stannis Baratheon either.

565
00:44:56,622 --> 00:45:00,080
You spent your life convincing
90 clans to come together

566
00:45:00,081 --> 00:45:01,163
for the first time in history.

567
00:45:01,164 --> 00:45:04,330
Thenns and Hornfoots,

568
00:45:04,331 --> 00:45:07,413
the ice-river clans,
even the giants.

569
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:10,413
A life's work uniting them.
You didn't do it for power.

570
00:45:10,414 --> 00:45:13,788
You didn't do it for glory.

571
00:45:13,789 --> 00:45:15,955
You brought them
together to save them

572
00:45:15,956 --> 00:45:17,496
<i>because none of them
will survive the winter,</i>

573
00:45:17,497 --> 00:45:19,371
<i>not if they're north
of the Wall.</i>

574
00:45:19,372 --> 00:45:21,371
Isn't their survival
more important than your pride?

575
00:45:21,372 --> 00:45:23,206
Pride?

576
00:45:25,372 --> 00:45:27,914
Fuck my pride.

577
00:45:29,206 --> 00:45:31,497
This isn't about that.

578
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:36,622
Then bend the knee
and save your people.

579
00:45:39,497 --> 00:45:42,746
They followed me
because they respected me.

580
00:45:42,747 --> 00:45:44,705
Because they believed in me.

581
00:45:44,706 --> 00:45:47,080
The moment I kneel
for a southern king, that's all gone.

582
00:45:47,081 --> 00:45:50,371
And how many tens of thousands
are out there right now?

583
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:53,621
How many women?
How many children?

584
00:45:53,622 --> 00:45:56,663
And you won't go out and rescue
them because why?

585
00:45:56,664 --> 00:45:58,871
You're afraid of looking afraid.

586
00:45:58,872 --> 00:46:01,706
Oh, I am afraid.

587
00:46:02,331 --> 00:46:04,497
No shame in that.

588
00:46:13,872 --> 00:46:17,788
How will they do it?
Beheading?

589
00:46:17,789 --> 00:46:19,664
Hanging?

590
00:46:22,372 --> 00:46:24,956
They'll burn you alive.

591
00:46:29,622 --> 00:46:31,414
Bad way to go.

592
00:46:35,539 --> 00:46:37,371
I'll be honest with you.

593
00:46:37,372 --> 00:46:39,371
I don't want to die.

594
00:46:39,372 --> 00:46:41,538
And burnt to death,

595
00:46:41,539 --> 00:46:43,496
I don't want people
to remember me like that,

596
00:46:43,497 --> 00:46:45,371
scorched and screaming.

597
00:46:45,372 --> 00:46:48,163
But it's better than betraying

598
00:46:48,164 --> 00:46:49,871
everything I believe.

599
00:46:49,872 --> 00:46:52,330
And what happens to your people?

600
00:46:52,331 --> 00:46:56,080
You preserve your dignity
and die standing

601
00:46:56,081 --> 00:46:58,496
and they'll sing
songs about you.

602
00:46:58,497 --> 00:46:59,955
You'd rather burn than kneel.

603
00:46:59,956 --> 00:47:01,622
The great hero.

604
00:47:04,456 --> 00:47:07,330
Until winter comes and
the white walkers come for us all

605
00:47:07,331 --> 00:47:09,997
and there's no one left to sing.

606
00:47:12,414 --> 00:47:13,996
You're a good lad.

607
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:17,163
Truly you are.

608
00:47:17,164 --> 00:47:22,205
But if you can't understand why I won't
enlist my people

609
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:24,955
in a foreigner's war,

610
00:47:24,956 --> 00:47:26,956
there's no point explaining.

611
00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:45,538
I think you're making
a terrible mistake.

612
00:47:47,372 --> 00:47:49,913
The freedom to make
my own mistakes

613
00:47:49,914 --> 00:47:51,581
was all I ever wanted.

614
00:49:01,289 --> 00:49:04,913
Mance Rayder, you've been called
the King-beyond-the-Wall.

615
00:49:04,914 --> 00:49:07,663
Westeros only has one king.

616
00:49:07,664 --> 00:49:09,997
Bend the knee,
I promise you mercy.

617
00:49:23,539 --> 00:49:25,664
Kneel and live.

618
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:36,831
This was my home for many years.

619
00:49:38,581 --> 00:49:40,163
I wish you good fortune

620
00:49:40,164 --> 00:49:42,831
in the wars to come.

621
00:50:24,206 --> 00:50:27,246
We all must choose.

622
00:50:27,247 --> 00:50:31,830
Man or woman, young or old,

623
00:50:31,831 --> 00:50:35,246
lord or peasant,
our choices are the same.

624
00:50:35,247 --> 00:50:38,746
We choose light
or we choose darkness.

625
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:41,788
<i>We choose good
or we choose evil.</i>

626
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:46,497
We choose the true god
or the false.

627
00:50:57,456 --> 00:50:59,371
Free folk,

628
00:50:59,372 --> 00:51:01,788
<i>there is only one true king</i>

629
00:51:01,789 --> 00:51:04,913
<i>and his name is Stannis.</i>

630
00:51:04,914 --> 00:51:07,371
Here stands your king of lies.

631
00:51:07,372 --> 00:51:10,497
Behold the fate of those
who choose the darkness.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
