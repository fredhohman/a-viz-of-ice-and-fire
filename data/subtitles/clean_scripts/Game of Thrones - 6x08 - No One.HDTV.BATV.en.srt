00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,550
<i>My son.</i>

4
00:01:58,262 --> 00:02:00,112
My firstborn son.

5
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:06,595
My child king, hush.

6
00:02:09,037 --> 00:02:11,937
Listen to the gods, for you they sing.

7
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:19,609
Fight no more, sweet child.
Your wars are won.

8
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:22,689
The wolves are buried

9
00:02:23,682 --> 00:02:26,032
and the false stag done.

10
00:02:30,315 --> 00:02:34,116
Shut your blue eyes, my love.
Let the crown fall.

11
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:37,691
The Father above
beckons you to his hall.

12
00:02:38,663 --> 00:02:42,217
In Seventh Heaven
I'll see you once more.

13
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,488
But now I seek vengeance
on Sansa the whore

14
00:02:50,265 --> 00:02:52,765
and my brother the Imp

15
00:02:53,183 --> 00:02:55,083
who killed his own king.

16
00:02:56,148 --> 00:03:00,891
Born amongst lions, our curse from within.
I will slay him, I swear.

17
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:06,287
With noose or with knife,
though it take me a fortnight,

18
00:03:06,664 --> 00:03:10,212
a moon or my life.

19
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,453
<i>What is that I hear and smell?</i>

20
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:40,803
<i>Someone I'll soon send to hell.</i>

21
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,440
<i>It's time to see if truth they told</i>

22
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,560
<i>who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.</i>

23
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,090
<i>Get the wig!</i>

24
00:03:48,192 --> 00:03:51,907
<i>You beast, you beast.
You killed my wife.</i>

25
00:03:51,937 --> 00:03:54,857
<i>And now you've
taken your father's life.</i>

26
00:03:55,043 --> 00:03:57,957
<i>No worse child ever stained this land.</i>

27
00:03:58,126 --> 00:04:00,940
<i>I curse the day I named you.</i>

28
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,885
<i>My greatest crime!</i>

29
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:40,517
You're good at that.

30
00:04:40,604 --> 00:04:42,304
Where did you learn?

31
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:45,071
I'm a jealous woman.

32
00:04:45,255 --> 00:04:50,364
I've always liked bad men
and they've always liked me.

33
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:53,901
They'd come home
wherever home was that night

34
00:04:53,931 --> 00:04:56,667
stinking of some whore's perfume.

35
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:04,081
So we'd fight and I'd put a
hole in them. And then I'd feel terrible,

36
00:05:04,355 --> 00:05:07,495
so I'd patch them up.
I got good at patching them up.

37
00:05:07,547 --> 00:05:09,847
And good at putting holes in them.

38
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:11,129
And that.

39
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,683
What happened to the actress?

40
00:05:16,928 --> 00:05:19,078
The one who wanted you dead.

41
00:05:20,063 --> 00:05:21,263
Bianca.

42
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:26,567
She'll have a hard time finding work
as an actress after what I did to her face.

43
00:05:31,187 --> 00:05:32,386
Mmm.

44
00:05:32,622 --> 00:05:34,672
I never did learn to cook.

45
00:05:35,063 --> 00:05:37,599
But eat. Eat. You need it.

46
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,660
The company is moving on to Pentos soon.

47
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,085
You should come with us.

48
00:05:44,115 --> 00:05:46,515
- I can't.
- Why not?

49
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,759
Got a feeling you'd be
good at this sort of work.

50
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:51,289
And besides,
we need a new actress.

51
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:54,609
I don't think I could
remember all of the lines.

52
00:05:55,116 --> 00:05:56,316
Come with us.

53
00:05:57,846 --> 00:05:59,646
What's left for you here?

54
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:02,551
You wouldn't be safe.

55
00:06:03,756 --> 00:06:05,706
Not while she's looking for me.

56
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:07,389
Who?

57
00:06:08,684 --> 00:06:10,134
She doesn't have a name.

58
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,410
Where will you go?

59
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,875
Essos is east and Westeros is west.

60
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:27,005
But what's west of Westeros?

61
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,310
I don't know.

62
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:29,961
Nobody does.

63
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,234
- That's where all the maps stop.
- The edge of the world, maybe.

64
00:06:34,418 --> 00:06:36,318
I'd like to see that.

65
00:06:46,457 --> 00:06:48,957
- What's that?
- Milk of the poppy.

66
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:50,935
I don't want any.

67
00:06:52,465 --> 00:06:55,065
Sleep is the only way you'll heal.

68
00:06:55,984 --> 00:06:56,834
Trust me,

69
00:06:57,236 --> 00:07:00,636
if my soup didn't
kill you, nothing will.

70
00:07:42,035 --> 00:07:45,303
Thing about Gatins, right,
is he used to be pretty.

71
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,415
I was a famous kisser.

72
00:07:47,445 --> 00:07:50,595
You lads know how to kiss proper?

73
00:07:51,976 --> 00:07:55,424
- Course we do.
- This is for masters, this technique.

74
00:07:55,555 --> 00:07:57,115
- You're not ready.
- I'm ready.

75
00:07:57,145 --> 00:07:58,695
He says he's ready.

76
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:00,645
All right.

77
00:08:01,293 --> 00:08:02,843
Now, pay attention.

78
00:08:05,474 --> 00:08:08,974
You put your left hand
on the back of the lady's head.

79
00:08:09,094 --> 00:08:12,744
Your right hand holds the
small of the lady's back like so.

80
00:08:13,423 --> 00:08:14,823
Very romantic.

81
00:08:15,115 --> 00:08:17,265
Take your middle finger, yeah,

82
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:20,373
and you jam it right up her bunghole.

83
00:08:22,695 --> 00:08:24,345
So fucking close!

84
00:08:24,935 --> 00:08:27,365
Ah, it smells like pussy to me.

85
00:08:27,395 --> 00:08:29,115
Look at him.
You get hard, boy?

86
00:08:29,145 --> 00:08:30,345
Fuck you!

87
00:08:30,695 --> 00:08:32,595
Disgusting old twats.

88
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:39,065
Got off on that,
did you, you old fuck?

89
00:09:00,865 --> 00:09:02,145
Where's the other one?

90
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:04,984
- The one with the yellow cloak.
- Fuck you!

91
00:09:05,014 --> 00:09:09,014
Those are your last words, fuck you?
Come on, you can do better.

92
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:10,517
Cunt!

93
00:09:11,223 --> 00:09:13,573
You're shit at dying, you know that?

94
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:32,057
_

95
00:09:32,087 --> 00:09:37,336
_

96
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:41,942
_

97
00:09:41,972 --> 00:09:45,804
_

98
00:09:47,077 --> 00:09:50,113
- I'd call that a successful gambit.
- Would you?

99
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:53,205
Look around.
The city has come back to life.

100
00:09:53,235 --> 00:09:57,235
- You made a pact with fanatics.
- I did and it worked.

101
00:09:57,265 --> 00:10:00,965
If you shaved your beard with
a straight razor, you'd say the razor worked.

102
00:10:00,995 --> 00:10:03,435
That doesn't mean it
won't cut your throat.

103
00:10:03,465 --> 00:10:06,465
Spoken like a man who
has never had to shave.

104
00:10:11,422 --> 00:10:12,872
I'm going to miss you.

105
00:10:13,385 --> 00:10:14,585
I know.

106
00:10:15,165 --> 00:10:18,165
I hope you're right about
this expedition of yours.

107
00:10:18,195 --> 00:10:21,041
If I don't return,
you'll know I was wrong.

108
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:28,572
We need friends in Westeros.
And we need ships.

109
00:10:28,602 --> 00:10:30,275
Most of all, we need our queen.

110
00:10:30,305 --> 00:10:31,605
She'll come back.

111
00:10:32,313 --> 00:10:33,763
She has to.

112
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:37,035
My heart's been broken
too many times already.

113
00:10:38,873 --> 00:10:40,995
I'll walk the rest of the way myself.

114
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:46,175
I can't go off on a secret mission in the
company of the most famous dwarf in the city.

115
00:10:49,135 --> 00:10:50,335
Varys.

116
00:10:52,262 --> 00:10:55,062
The most famous dwarf in the world.

117
00:11:22,672 --> 00:11:24,954
Your Grace, several
members of the Faith Militant

118
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,834
have been permitted
entry to the Red Keep.

119
00:11:27,865 --> 00:11:29,315
Have been permitted?

120
00:11:30,235 --> 00:11:33,424
That's rather a
tortured way of putting it.

121
00:11:33,454 --> 00:11:35,455
They demand to see you, Your Grace.

122
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:38,885
Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?

123
00:11:40,855 --> 00:11:42,909
The king is aware of their presence?

124
00:11:43,065 --> 00:11:47,354
He is, Your Grace.
He's currently in his chambers at prayer.

125
00:12:02,564 --> 00:12:04,994
Your Grace, His Holiness the High Septon

126
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,575
wishes to speak with you
at the Great Sept of Baelor.

127
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:12,205
His Holiness the High Septon is
welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.

128
00:12:12,235 --> 00:12:13,572
Your Grace,

129
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:17,205
- this is not a request.
- It is a request, Cousin Lancel.

130
00:12:17,395 --> 00:12:19,995
You are asking me for something,
I'm refusing.

131
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:24,310
The High Septon commands you.

132
00:12:25,075 --> 00:12:27,925
Are you sure you
want to refuse him?

133
00:12:29,445 --> 00:12:31,475
He promised me I could
stay in the Red Keep

134
00:12:31,505 --> 00:12:34,665
- until my trial.
- He made no such promises.

135
00:12:34,695 --> 00:12:37,945
- If you refuse to come of
your own free will... - Get out.

136
00:12:47,932 --> 00:12:49,432
Move aside, ser.

137
00:12:52,615 --> 00:12:56,665
Order your man to step
aside or there will be violence.

138
00:13:03,255 --> 00:13:05,005
I choose violence.

139
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:49,841
Please tell His High Holiness
he's always welcome to visit.

140
00:14:01,178 --> 00:14:03,628
Looks like a siege, my lady.

141
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,070
You have a keen military mind, Pod.

142
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,220
My lady.

143
00:14:17,452 --> 00:14:18,552
My lady!

144
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:23,609
Who goes there?!

145
00:14:24,502 --> 00:14:26,052
State your business!

146
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,990
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

147
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,460
Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister
I've come to speak with him.

148
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:36,359
Tell him I have his sword.

149
00:14:47,729 --> 00:14:50,629
Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren't we?

150
00:14:55,319 --> 00:14:57,419
Podrick fucking Payne.

151
00:14:58,187 --> 00:15:00,987
- I thought you'd be dead by now.
- Not yet.

152
00:15:02,572 --> 00:15:04,822
- Are they in there?
- Uh-huh.

153
00:15:08,761 --> 00:15:10,561
You think they're fucking?

154
00:15:11,015 --> 00:15:12,015
What?

155
00:15:12,303 --> 00:15:13,503
No.

156
00:15:14,075 --> 00:15:15,175
Why not?

157
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:16,715
I'd fuck her.

158
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:21,245
- You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?
- I'm her squire. - Oh.

159
00:15:22,877 --> 00:15:24,685
Well, he'd fuck her, that's for sure.

160
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,388
And she'd fuck him, don't you think?

161
00:15:26,418 --> 00:15:28,468
The way she looks at him.

162
00:15:28,603 --> 00:15:31,376
The way all women look
at him is frankly irritating.

163
00:15:31,406 --> 00:15:35,038
I preferred working with the
little brother on that account.

164
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:38,668
Come on, you're the
one with the magic cock.

165
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,956
You must have
shown it to her by now.

166
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:45,406
She's training me to fight.

167
00:15:45,436 --> 00:15:46,686
Is she? Oh.

168
00:15:46,992 --> 00:15:49,011
An hour in the morning,
an hour at night.

169
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,291
Every day.

170
00:15:51,594 --> 00:15:55,975
Then how come an old cunt like me
can still sneak up and murder you?

171
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:59,495
- Well, that's a different sort of fighting.
- Now, that's the truth, isn't it?

172
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:02,575
You want to learn
that sort of fighting?

173
00:16:02,986 --> 00:16:03,986
All right.

174
00:16:05,124 --> 00:16:07,624
All right, let's
start with your footwork.

175
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:09,325
Show me your stance.

176
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:12,620
Now listen to me, Pod.

177
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,450
See how your feet
are about a yard apart?

178
00:16:15,664 --> 00:16:18,229
Lesson number one,
assume everyone wants to hit you.

179
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:22,304
'Cause they do, Pod.
Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire.

180
00:16:22,334 --> 00:16:25,134
Do it again.
Come on, don't sulk.

181
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,803
<i>I never thought you'd find her.</i>

182
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,870
<i>I just assumed Sansa was dead.</i>

183
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,905
Why would you assume that?

184
00:16:30,935 --> 00:16:34,753
In my experience,
girls like her don't live very long.

185
00:16:34,783 --> 00:16:37,583
I don't think you
know many girls like her.

186
00:16:37,891 --> 00:16:40,091
Well, I'm proud of you.

187
00:16:40,745 --> 00:16:44,960
I am. You fulfilled your oath
to Catelyn Stark against all odds.

188
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,890
Of course, my sister wants Sansa dead.

189
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:54,441
The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey's
murder, so there is that complication.

190
00:16:56,179 --> 00:16:57,477
What the hell are you doing here?

191
00:16:57,507 --> 00:16:59,507
I've come for the Blackfish.

192
00:16:59,696 --> 00:17:01,396
You're welcome to have him.

193
00:17:01,601 --> 00:17:05,245
Lady Sansa desires to take her
ancestral seat back from the Boltons

194
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:08,488
and assume her rightful
position as Lady of Winterfell.

195
00:17:08,518 --> 00:17:11,885
With what army does
she plan on taking Winterfell?

196
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:14,983
- The Tully army.
- They're a bit occupied at the moment.

197
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:18,365
I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun
currently defended by the Tully rebels,

198
00:17:18,395 --> 00:17:20,367
so you can see the conundrum.

199
00:17:20,397 --> 00:17:22,616
The Tullys are rebels because
they're fighting for their home?

200
00:17:22,646 --> 00:17:25,158
Riverrun was granted
to the Freys by royal decree.

201
00:17:25,188 --> 00:17:28,401
As a reward for betraying Robb
Stark and slaughtering his family.

202
00:17:28,531 --> 00:17:29,981
Exactly.

203
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:36,005
We shouldn't argue about politics.

204
00:17:36,035 --> 00:17:38,285
You're a knight, Ser Jaime.

205
00:17:38,762 --> 00:17:40,612
I know there is honor in you.

206
00:17:41,632 --> 00:17:43,587
- I've seen it myself.
- I'm a Lannister.

207
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:45,562
Don't ask me to betray my own house.

208
00:17:45,592 --> 00:17:47,592
I do no such thing.

209
00:17:48,148 --> 00:17:50,812
Take Riverrun without bloodshed.

210
00:17:50,842 --> 00:17:54,453
Ride south again with your
mission complete and your army intact.

211
00:17:54,483 --> 00:17:56,115
What do you propose?

212
00:17:56,145 --> 00:17:59,559
Allow me to enter Riverrun
under a flag of truce.

213
00:17:59,675 --> 00:18:02,063
Let me try to persuade the
Blackfish to give up the castle.

214
00:18:02,093 --> 00:18:04,622
Why would he abandon
his ancestral home?

215
00:18:04,652 --> 00:18:08,752
Because you'll allow him to
lead the Tully forces safely north.

216
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:13,311
Have you ever met the Blackfish?

217
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,922
- No. - He's even
more stubborn than you are.

218
00:18:18,987 --> 00:18:22,587
All right. Try to talk
some sense into the old goat.

219
00:18:22,676 --> 00:18:25,124
He won't listen,
but his men might.

220
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:27,956
Not everybody wants to
die for someone else's home.

221
00:18:27,986 --> 00:18:30,138
I need your word.

222
00:18:30,823 --> 00:18:35,173
If I persuade him to abandon the castle,
you'll grant a safe passage north.

223
00:18:35,398 --> 00:18:37,098
You have my word.

224
00:18:37,912 --> 00:18:40,062
You have until nightfall.

225
00:18:56,683 --> 00:18:59,083
You gave it to me for a purpose.

226
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,606
I've achieved that purpose.

227
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:07,278
It's yours.

228
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:10,574
It will always be yours.

229
00:19:20,373 --> 00:19:22,091
One last thing, Ser Jaime.

230
00:19:22,121 --> 00:19:24,376
Yes, Lady Brienne?

231
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:28,234
Should I fail to persuade
the Blackfish to surrender

232
00:19:28,595 --> 00:19:31,188
and if you attack the castle,

233
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:34,557
honor compels me
to fight for Sansa's kin.

234
00:19:34,587 --> 00:19:36,087
Of course it does.

235
00:19:36,914 --> 00:19:39,014
To fight you.

236
00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:45,066
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

237
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:57,249
<i>I've said no three times already.</i>

238
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,357
I have a signed letter
from your niece Sansa Stark.

239
00:19:59,387 --> 00:20:01,433
I haven't seen her
since she was a child.

240
00:20:01,463 --> 00:20:03,768
I don't know her signature.
I don't know you.

241
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:05,248
And I will not surrender.

242
00:20:05,908 --> 00:20:07,958
Double the guards tonight.

243
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,805
The Kingslayer wants to try us.

244
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,257
I can feel it.

245
00:20:13,853 --> 00:20:17,843
- As I have said, my name is...
- Yes, Brienne of Tarth. I know your father.

246
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,085
- Good man.
- He always spoke highly of you.

247
00:20:20,115 --> 00:20:22,835
And if he were here now,
I'd tell him the same I'm telling you.

248
00:20:22,865 --> 00:20:25,338
If you think I'm
abandoning my family's seat

249
00:20:25,368 --> 00:20:27,968
on the Kingslayer's word
of honor, you're a bloody fool.

250
00:20:27,998 --> 00:20:30,684
Riverrun cannot stand
against the Lannisters and the Freys.

251
00:20:30,714 --> 00:20:34,232
We can stand longer than your
one-handed friend thinks we can.

252
00:20:34,262 --> 00:20:35,857
He's not my friend.

253
00:20:35,887 --> 00:20:36,737
No?

254
00:20:38,418 --> 00:20:41,593
Who gave you permission to cross
the siege line and enter the castle?

255
00:20:41,623 --> 00:20:44,463
Who gave you that sword
with the gold lion on the pommel?

256
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:48,493
Ser Jaime kept his word
to your niece Catelyn Stark.

257
00:20:48,644 --> 00:20:51,826
He sent me to find Sansa,
to help her as Catelyn wanted.

258
00:20:51,856 --> 00:20:53,855
He gave me this sword to protect her.

259
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:58,585
That is what I have done and
I will continue to do until the day I die.

260
00:21:12,255 --> 00:21:14,406
She's exactly like her mother.

261
00:21:20,984 --> 00:21:23,794
I don't have enough men
to help her take Winterfell.

262
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,909
You have more than she does.

263
00:21:25,939 --> 00:21:28,689
She wants her home back.
I understand that.

264
00:21:28,873 --> 00:21:30,423
But this is my home.

265
00:21:30,695 --> 00:21:32,718
And if Jaime Lannister wants it,

266
00:21:32,748 --> 00:21:36,898
he can bloody well take it
the way everyone else does.

267
00:21:52,942 --> 00:21:54,892
Find the maester.

268
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:59,134
We need to get a raven north to Sansa.

269
00:22:00,472 --> 00:22:02,122
What should I write?

270
00:22:05,184 --> 00:22:07,034
Tell her I failed.

271
00:22:37,634 --> 00:22:39,584
There's to be a royal announcement?

272
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:41,349
There is.

273
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,480
Why wasn't I informed?

274
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,009
There is to be a royal announcement

275
00:22:48,207 --> 00:22:49,957
in the throne room

276
00:22:50,353 --> 00:22:52,453
at this very moment.

277
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:57,150
Where are you going?

278
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:02,335
To stand by my son.

279
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:07,327
Your place is in the gallery
with the other ladies of the court.

280
00:23:15,216 --> 00:23:16,553
Your Grace...

281
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:37,152
Lords and ladies,

282
00:23:37,743 --> 00:23:39,968
the Faith and the Crown

283
00:23:40,256 --> 00:23:43,404
are the two pillars
that hold up this world.

284
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:47,281
One collapses,
so does the other.

285
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:51,221
The Father judges us all.

286
00:23:51,488 --> 00:23:53,536
If you break his laws...

287
00:23:56,132 --> 00:23:57,729
you will be punished.

288
00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:03,344
After conferring with His
Holiness the High Septon,

289
00:24:03,514 --> 00:24:07,648
we have determined that Loras Tyrell
and Cersei Lannister's trial

290
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:12,970
will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor
on the first day of the Festival of the Mother.

291
00:24:18,993 --> 00:24:23,201
Furthermore, after much
prayer and reflection,

292
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,256
the Crown has decided
that from this day forward,

293
00:24:27,286 --> 00:24:31,260
trial by combat will be forbidden
throughout the Seven Kingdoms.

294
00:24:33,337 --> 00:24:35,687
The tradition is a brutish one,

295
00:24:35,783 --> 00:24:40,397
a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in
order to avoid true judgment from the gods.

296
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,902
Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell

297
00:24:42,932 --> 00:24:47,651
will stand trial before seven septons
as it was in the earliest days of the Faith.

298
00:24:48,306 --> 00:24:50,306
Seven blessings to all.

299
00:24:50,381 --> 00:24:52,681
<i>Seven blessings.</i>

300
00:25:14,383 --> 00:25:16,056
Your Grace...

301
00:25:17,588 --> 00:25:21,038
that old rumor you told me about.

302
00:25:22,184 --> 00:25:24,683
My little birds investigated.

303
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:27,729
And?

304
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:32,306
Was it just a rumor or something more?

305
00:25:32,771 --> 00:25:34,136
More.

306
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,010
Much more.

307
00:25:44,164 --> 00:25:45,857
You seem happy.

308
00:25:46,446 --> 00:25:47,980
I am happy.

309
00:25:49,343 --> 00:25:51,278
You should both be happy as well.

310
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,462
Not so long ago, this city
was ready to devour itself.

311
00:25:55,836 --> 00:26:00,775
- Now it's like a man reborn.
- I will be happy when our queen returns.

312
00:26:00,883 --> 00:26:03,975
Why don't you drink?
Why don't either of you ever drink?

313
00:26:04,005 --> 00:26:05,457
Unsullied never drink.

314
00:26:05,487 --> 00:26:06,845
- Why not?
- Rules.

315
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:09,075
And who made these rules?

316
00:26:09,248 --> 00:26:11,248
Your former masters?

317
00:26:11,817 --> 00:26:15,006
Those miserable old shits
didn't want you to be human.

318
00:26:15,036 --> 00:26:16,886
Have a drink with me.

319
00:26:19,698 --> 00:26:21,052
And you?

320
00:26:21,475 --> 00:26:22,848
What's your excuse?

321
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:27,203
I have tried wine before.
It made me feel funny.

322
00:26:27,433 --> 00:26:29,833
That's how you know it's working.

323
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:33,853
Here's to our queen.

324
00:26:34,822 --> 00:26:38,222
Anyone not drinking is
disrespecting our queen.

325
00:26:40,954 --> 00:26:44,906
To Daenerys Stormborn,
Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains,

326
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,210
long may she reign.

327
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,774
- Long may she reign.
- Long may she reign.

328
00:26:54,564 --> 00:26:57,530
- Do you like it?
- Tastes like it has turned.

329
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,194
Yes, yes. Fermentation.

330
00:27:04,777 --> 00:27:05,778
One day,

331
00:27:06,587 --> 00:27:10,287
after our queen has
taken the Seven Kingdoms...

332
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:13,455
I'd like to have my own vineyard.

333
00:27:14,556 --> 00:27:16,656
Make my own wine.

334
00:27:17,447 --> 00:27:19,547
The Imp's Delight.

335
00:27:19,994 --> 00:27:22,844
Only my close friends could drink it.

336
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:29,078
Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.

337
00:27:29,134 --> 00:27:30,984
I do not know any jokes.

338
00:27:31,304 --> 00:27:32,670
Grey Worm?

339
00:27:34,878 --> 00:27:36,078
Right.

340
00:27:38,483 --> 00:27:43,974
Three lords walk into a tavern...
a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister.

341
00:27:44,091 --> 00:27:48,441
They order ale, but when
the barkeep brings them over,

342
00:27:48,632 --> 00:27:51,386
each of them finds a fly in his cup.

343
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:55,651
The Lannister, outraged,
shoves the cup aside and demands another.

344
00:27:55,733 --> 00:27:59,616
The Martell plucks the fly
out and swallows it whole.

345
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,792
The Stark reaches into his cup,

346
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,182
pulls out the fly and shouts,

347
00:28:07,707 --> 00:28:12,008
"Spit it out, you wee shit. Spit it out."

348
00:28:17,471 --> 00:28:19,482
It's funnier in Westeros.

349
00:28:19,512 --> 00:28:22,857
The Starks and the Lannisters,
I thought these were enemies.

350
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:23,961
Yes.

351
00:28:24,045 --> 00:28:27,495
A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho.

352
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:31,958
- Not a true story, necessarily.
- A story that's supposed to make you laugh...

353
00:28:32,109 --> 00:28:35,109
ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps.

354
00:28:35,216 --> 00:28:37,243
Missandei, do you like the wine?

355
00:28:37,931 --> 00:28:38,931
I do.

356
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:40,846
Tell a joke.

357
00:28:46,753 --> 00:28:50,303
Two translators are on a sinking ship.

358
00:28:50,801 --> 00:28:52,376
The first says,

359
00:28:53,238 --> 00:28:54,910
"Do you know how to swim?"

360
00:28:55,727 --> 00:28:59,927
The second says, "No, but I
can shout for help in 19 languages."

361
00:29:02,797 --> 00:29:05,364
Ah!

362
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,293
That is the worst joke I ever heard.

363
00:29:11,323 --> 00:29:13,028
You don't even know what a joke is.

364
00:29:13,058 --> 00:29:16,692
I am soldier all my life.
You think I never hear joke?

365
00:29:16,722 --> 00:29:18,272
You lied to us.

366
00:29:20,186 --> 00:29:21,986
I make joke.

367
00:29:32,247 --> 00:29:33,591
More jokes.

368
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:37,688
I once walked into a brothel
with a honeycomb and a jackass.

369
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,469
The madam says...

370
00:29:52,861 --> 00:29:56,222
The Masters have
come for their property.

371
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:14,712
Lord Edmure.

372
00:30:16,787 --> 00:30:19,231
I apologize for the
way the Freys treated you.

373
00:30:19,261 --> 00:30:21,875
A man of your birth deserves better.

374
00:30:22,075 --> 00:30:25,975
You have my word you'll be
properly fed and clothed from now on.

375
00:30:27,603 --> 00:30:29,253
I have your word?

376
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:33,419
Oh, good.

377
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,815
Good, that's...

378
00:30:36,745 --> 00:30:38,395
that's a fine thing.

379
00:30:40,265 --> 00:30:43,231
My uncle will never
surrender the castle, ser.

380
00:30:43,463 --> 00:30:47,250
- Whatever game you're playing.
- The Blackfish is an old man.

381
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:53,259
A good death is all he can hope for.
But you, you have a child now, I've heard.

382
00:30:53,964 --> 00:30:58,289
A son you sired on your
wedding night. You're a potent man.

383
00:30:58,411 --> 00:31:00,320
A son I've never met

384
00:31:00,982 --> 00:31:04,932
born of a wife that I haven't
seen since our first night together.

385
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:07,519
You should be with them both.

386
00:31:07,978 --> 00:31:10,128
I can arrange that, you realize?

387
00:31:10,274 --> 00:31:12,461
Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock.

388
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:15,987
A tutor for your boy,
knights to train him to fight and to ride.

389
00:31:16,017 --> 00:31:17,315
And when he comes of age,

390
00:31:17,345 --> 00:31:20,932
- he'll have a keep of his own.
- Do you imagine yourself a decent person?

391
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,080
Is that it?

392
00:31:23,306 --> 00:31:26,556
After you've massacred my family.

393
00:31:28,144 --> 00:31:30,226
Kept me in a cell for years.

394
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:32,006
Stolen our lands.

395
00:31:32,286 --> 00:31:34,693
I'll remind you that
our houses are at war.

396
00:31:34,723 --> 00:31:37,016
I'm sorry if this conflict
has inconvenienced you,

397
00:31:37,046 --> 00:31:39,636
but rebelling against the
Crown does have consequences.

398
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:41,929
Says the man who shoved
his sword through his king's back.

399
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:46,128
Did I give you the impression
that this was a negotiation? It's not.

400
00:31:48,505 --> 00:31:51,651
You understand.
On some level you understand

401
00:31:51,681 --> 00:31:55,118
- that you're an evil man.
- I'll leave the judgments to the gods.

402
00:31:55,203 --> 00:31:57,604
Well, that is convenient for you.

403
00:32:01,081 --> 00:32:04,656
You're a fine-looking fellow, aren't you?

404
00:32:07,316 --> 00:32:09,443
Your square jaw,

405
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,837
your golden armor.

406
00:32:13,353 --> 00:32:14,641
Tell me,

407
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:20,321
I want to know. I truly do.
How do you live with yourself?

408
00:32:22,985 --> 00:32:28,185
All of us have to believe
that we're decent, don't we?

409
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,098
You have to sleep at night.

410
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:34,141
How do you tell yourself

411
00:32:34,539 --> 00:32:39,539
that you're decent
after everything that you've done?

412
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,770
I was your sister's prisoner once.

413
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:55,120
She hit me on the head with
a rock if I remember correctly.

414
00:32:57,724 --> 00:32:59,024
Yeah.

415
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:04,200
- She should have killed you.
- Perhaps, but she didn't.

416
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:09,359
Catelyn Stark hated
me just like you hate me.

417
00:33:09,682 --> 00:33:11,389
But I didn't hate her.

418
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,542
I admired her.

419
00:33:13,778 --> 00:33:15,463
Far more than her husband or her son.

420
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,593
Do you think I care whom
you admire and whom you don't?

421
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:22,173
No, I don't, but I'm telling you anyway because
you're my prisoner. You don't have a choice.

422
00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:26,864
The love she had for her children,
I was a little awed by it.

423
00:33:27,045 --> 00:33:28,945
Reminded me of my sister.

424
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:32,299
Oh, I see.

425
00:33:34,695 --> 00:33:38,107
- You're a madman.
- I'm not here to trade insults.

426
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,332
- Your sister was a strong...
- Don't talk about Cat!

427
00:33:41,383 --> 00:33:44,008
I'll talk about whomever I want.

428
00:33:45,945 --> 00:33:47,827
She loved her children.

429
00:33:48,341 --> 00:33:52,834
I suppose all mothers do,
but Catelyn and Cersei,

430
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,948
there's a fierceness you don't often see.

431
00:33:55,978 --> 00:33:58,790
They'd do anything
to protect their babies.

432
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,287
Start a war.

433
00:34:00,317 --> 00:34:04,317
Burn cities to ash.
Free their worst enemies.

434
00:34:04,653 --> 00:34:06,803
The things we do for love.

435
00:34:11,169 --> 00:34:14,430
You didn't come here
to talk about our sisters.

436
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:18,074
That's exactly why I came here.

437
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:20,848
I love Cersei.

438
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,775
You can laugh at that if you want.
You can sneer. Doesn't matter.

439
00:34:25,923 --> 00:34:27,762
She needs me.

440
00:34:28,144 --> 00:34:31,629
And to get back to her,
I have to take Riverrun.

441
00:34:34,903 --> 00:34:37,303
I'll send for your baby boy.

442
00:34:38,254 --> 00:34:42,004
And I'll launch him into
Riverrun with a catapult.

443
00:34:42,171 --> 00:34:45,026
Because you don't
matter to me, Lord Edmure.

444
00:34:45,056 --> 00:34:47,378
Your son doesn't matter to me.

445
00:34:47,915 --> 00:34:51,803
The people in the castle
don't matter to me.

446
00:34:52,294 --> 00:34:54,444
Only Cersei.

447
00:34:56,362 --> 00:35:02,044
And if I have to slaughter every Tully
who ever lived to get back to her,

448
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:04,736
that's what I'll do.

449
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,434
<i>Who goes there?</i>

450
00:35:34,403 --> 00:35:37,547
Edmure Tully,
son of Hoster Tully

451
00:35:37,658 --> 00:35:40,658
and the rightful Lord of Riverrun.

452
00:35:42,644 --> 00:35:44,711
I demand entry.

453
00:35:45,011 --> 00:35:47,040
Don't let him in.

454
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:51,115
He's the Lord of Riverrun.
I have to obey his commands.

455
00:35:51,195 --> 00:35:55,683
He's been their captive ever since
they murdered his king at the Red Wedding.

456
00:35:56,063 --> 00:35:58,769
Why do you think the people who
murdered his king at the Red Wedding

457
00:35:58,799 --> 00:36:01,698
would decide to let him come home?

458
00:36:02,403 --> 00:36:04,803
Because it's a trap, you idiot.

459
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:08,310
- Don't let him in.
- He's my lord, my lord.

460
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,350
I've sworn to serve the Lord of
Riverrun and obey his commands.

461
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,338
You're not obeying
Edmure's commands.

462
00:36:14,721 --> 00:36:18,335
You're obeying the
fucking Kingslayer's commands.

463
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,261
<i>I demand entry.</i>

464
00:36:21,392 --> 00:36:24,719
- My lord has given an order.
- With a knife to his throat.

465
00:36:24,757 --> 00:36:26,683
That is not a valid order.

466
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,949
Lower the drawbridge and
open the gate for Lord Ed...

467
00:36:33,979 --> 00:36:35,067
Aye, ser.

468
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:40,104
I'll have your head
before I surrender Riverrun.

469
00:36:40,261 --> 00:36:43,736
You are not lord of this castle, my lord.

470
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:58,079
- Lower the drawbridge.
- Aye, ser!

471
00:37:42,931 --> 00:37:44,585
<i>If you're wrong,</i>

472
00:37:45,248 --> 00:37:48,748
we've just surrendered
our most valuable prisoner.

473
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,953
Welcome home, my lord.

474
00:38:34,927 --> 00:38:39,027
Command all the forces within
the castle to lay down their arms.

475
00:38:40,536 --> 00:38:42,036
Open the gates.

476
00:38:42,229 --> 00:38:45,229
- My lord...
- Your lord has given a command.

477
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:21,353
<i>Infantry, advance!</i>

478
00:39:35,091 --> 00:39:37,048
Find the Blackfish.

479
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:41,120
Put him in irons and
hand him over to the Freys.

480
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,666
Find him.

481
00:40:11,623 --> 00:40:12,623
Go on.

482
00:40:13,985 --> 00:40:16,682
- Come with us.
- I've run before from the Red Wedding.

483
00:40:16,712 --> 00:40:19,151
I'm not running again.
This is my family home.

484
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:21,068
Your family is in the North.

485
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:22,987
Come with us.

486
00:40:23,271 --> 00:40:26,945
Don't die for pride when
you can fight for your blood.

487
00:40:27,704 --> 00:40:31,469
You'll serve Sansa far
better than I ever could.

488
00:40:36,379 --> 00:40:37,857
<i>All the way down!</i>

489
00:40:37,887 --> 00:40:40,347
<i>- Check that out!
- Go on, now.</i>

490
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:44,059
I haven't had a proper
sword fight in years.

491
00:40:44,266 --> 00:40:46,956
I expect I'll make
a damn fool of myself.

492
00:41:21,095 --> 00:41:23,595
We found the Blackfish, my lord.

493
00:41:24,052 --> 00:41:25,052
Good.

494
00:41:25,354 --> 00:41:26,954
Bring him to me.

495
00:41:27,907 --> 00:41:30,207
He died fighting, my lord.

496
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:02,618
- I was wrong. I admit it.
- That changes nothing.

497
00:43:02,648 --> 00:43:05,041
The Unsullied could mount
a defense off the beachhead.

498
00:43:05,071 --> 00:43:08,331
- If the slavers' forces... - No more
talking from you. Your talking gave us this.

499
00:43:08,361 --> 00:43:10,091
And I have acknowledged that.
I'm trying...

500
00:43:10,121 --> 00:43:14,356
You're trying to tell me what the army should
do. You do not know what the army should do.

501
00:43:14,504 --> 00:43:16,954
All right, what should the army do?

502
00:43:17,031 --> 00:43:18,831
We'll not go to the beach.

503
00:43:18,923 --> 00:43:21,180
If we go to the beach, the
Masters will take the pyramid.

504
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:24,232
The pyramid is the only place
in the city we can defend. We stay here.

505
00:43:24,262 --> 00:43:26,951
- And then?
- We wait for them to come to us.

506
00:43:26,981 --> 00:43:28,430
Then we fight them.

507
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,800
Clegane.

508
00:44:41,195 --> 00:44:43,054
What the fuck you doing here?

509
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:44,473
Chasing them.

510
00:44:44,864 --> 00:44:46,843
- You?
- Hanging them.

511
00:44:47,611 --> 00:44:51,483
- Any particular reason?
- They're our men. Or they were.

512
00:44:51,874 --> 00:44:54,732
They attacked a nearby
sept and murdered the villagers.

513
00:44:54,762 --> 00:44:57,176
- Why do you want them?
- Same reason.

514
00:44:57,377 --> 00:44:59,427
I was helping build it.

515
00:44:59,919 --> 00:45:01,719
They killed a friend of mine.

516
00:45:01,884 --> 00:45:03,311
You've got friends?

517
00:45:03,476 --> 00:45:04,713
Not anymore.

518
00:45:05,243 --> 00:45:06,357
They're mine.

519
00:45:06,387 --> 00:45:08,533
It's the Brotherhood's good name
they've dragged through the dirt.

520
00:45:08,563 --> 00:45:11,861
Fuck your name. They're mine.
I killed you once before, Dondarrion.

521
00:45:11,891 --> 00:45:13,641
Happy to do it again.

522
00:45:14,264 --> 00:45:16,634
Drop that arrow, you bloody girl.

523
00:45:17,926 --> 00:45:21,176
Tougher girls than
you have tried to kill me.

524
00:45:22,741 --> 00:45:24,541
You can have one of them.

525
00:45:29,071 --> 00:45:30,371
Two.

526
00:45:41,757 --> 00:45:43,562
No, no, no.

527
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:45,740
We're not butchers.

528
00:45:45,794 --> 00:45:47,860
- We hang them.
- Hanging?

529
00:45:48,336 --> 00:45:51,424
All over in an instant.
Where's the punishment in that?

530
00:45:51,538 --> 00:45:53,833
- They die.
- We all bloody die.

531
00:45:53,863 --> 00:45:55,863
Except this one here.

532
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,660
I'll only gut one of them.

533
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:00,005
No.

534
00:46:01,574 --> 00:46:03,053
I'll chop off one hand.

535
00:46:03,083 --> 00:46:06,459
We gave you two of the three
out of respect for your loss.

536
00:46:06,489 --> 00:46:08,339
That's generous.

537
00:46:11,864 --> 00:46:13,814
Bunch of nancies.

538
00:46:15,191 --> 00:46:18,502
There was a time I would have killed
all seven of you just to gut these three.

539
00:46:18,532 --> 00:46:20,382
You're getting old, Clegane.

540
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,523
He's not.

541
00:46:23,985 --> 00:46:26,759
Please don't.
I'll give you anything.

542
00:46:54,851 --> 00:46:57,001
Got anything to eat?

543
00:47:08,895 --> 00:47:10,445
Enjoying yourself?

544
00:47:11,516 --> 00:47:13,295
I prefer chicken.

545
00:47:14,763 --> 00:47:16,363
You ought to join us.

546
00:47:16,947 --> 00:47:18,347
We could use you.

547
00:47:18,901 --> 00:47:20,509
I tried joining.

548
00:47:20,539 --> 00:47:24,639
- Didn't work out for me.
- Clegane we're here for a reason.

549
00:47:26,563 --> 00:47:30,036
The Lord of Light is keeping
Beric alive for a reason.

550
00:47:30,066 --> 00:47:35,023
He gave a failed, drunk priest
the power to bring him back for a reason.

551
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:38,285
We are part of something
larger than ourselves.

552
00:47:38,526 --> 00:47:43,665
Lots of horrible shit in this world gets
done for something larger than ourselves.

553
00:47:50,673 --> 00:47:52,938
Cold winds are rising in the North.

554
00:47:52,968 --> 00:47:55,062
And you're going to go stop them?

555
00:47:56,679 --> 00:47:59,232
We need good men to help us.

556
00:47:59,262 --> 00:48:02,762
Last time you saw me,
you wanted to execute me.

557
00:48:03,751 --> 00:48:05,050
<i>True enough.</i>

558
00:48:05,384 --> 00:48:09,041
But the Lord of Light gave
you the power to defeat me.

559
00:48:09,071 --> 00:48:10,086
Why?

560
00:48:10,977 --> 00:48:13,977
I beat you because
I'm better than you, Beric.

561
00:48:14,494 --> 00:48:18,256
I was better than you before you
started yammering on about the Lord

562
00:48:18,758 --> 00:48:20,877
and I'm better than you now.

563
00:48:21,629 --> 00:48:23,979
Aye, you're probably right.

564
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:26,020
You're a fighter.

565
00:48:26,464 --> 00:48:28,808
You were born a fighter.

566
00:48:29,047 --> 00:48:31,197
You walked away from the fight.

567
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,246
How did that go?

568
00:48:36,069 --> 00:48:38,803
Good and bad, young and old,

569
00:48:39,472 --> 00:48:43,322
the things we're fighting
will destroy them all alike.

570
00:48:43,723 --> 00:48:47,322
You can still help a lot more
than you've harmed, Clegane.

571
00:48:47,352 --> 00:48:49,152
It's not too late for you.

572
00:49:52,855 --> 00:49:54,046
Lady Crane?

573
00:50:02,884 --> 00:50:04,113
<i>Lady Crane?</i>

574
00:50:11,285 --> 00:50:15,336
If you'd have done your job,
she would have died painlessly.

575
00:50:17,103 --> 00:50:18,232
Instead...

576
00:50:21,321 --> 00:50:24,371
The Many-Faced God
was promised a name.

577
00:50:25,007 --> 00:50:27,657
He must always receive what is his.

578
00:50:27,753 --> 00:50:29,502
You can't change that.

579
00:50:30,742 --> 00:50:32,792
I can't change that.

580
00:50:32,949 --> 00:50:34,441
No one can.

581
00:50:37,388 --> 00:50:40,138
And now he's been
promised another name.

582
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,089
Hey!

583
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,119
Get out!

584
00:51:00,013 --> 00:51:01,946
Yah!

585
00:52:22,068 --> 00:52:23,068
Hey!

586
00:52:25,999 --> 00:52:27,832
Yah!

587
00:52:28,902 --> 00:52:30,434
Ah!

588
00:52:42,548 --> 00:52:44,279
<i>My basket!</i>

589
00:54:19,033 --> 00:54:21,063
It will all be over soon.

590
00:54:22,067 --> 00:54:25,084
On your knees or on your feet?

591
00:54:35,993 --> 00:54:38,212
Haven't we been through this already?

592
00:54:39,881 --> 00:54:41,785
That won't help you.

593
00:55:53,701 --> 00:55:55,851
You told her to kill me.

594
00:56:02,946 --> 00:56:03,975
Yes.

595
00:56:04,827 --> 00:56:06,531
But here you are.

596
00:56:07,661 --> 00:56:09,120
And there she is.

597
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:22,709
Finally a girl is no one.

598
00:56:26,059 --> 00:56:28,690
A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell

599
00:56:29,783 --> 00:56:31,706
and I'm going home.
