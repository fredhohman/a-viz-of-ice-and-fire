1
00:00:04,652 --> 00:00:06,681
There was a raven
from King's Landing.

2
00:00:06,956 --> 00:00:09,758
<i>Jon Arryn is dead.</i>

3
00:00:09,793 --> 00:00:11,727
<i>The King rides</i>
<i>for Winterfell</i>

4
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:14,229
<i>with the Queen</i>
<i>and all the rest of them.</i>

5
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,331
<i>The Queen</i>
<i>has two brothers?</i>

6
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:19,701
There's the pretty one,
and there's the clever one.

7
00:00:19,736 --> 00:00:21,870
I would name you
the Hand of the King.

8
00:00:21,905 --> 00:00:23,639
We were meant
to rule together.

9
00:00:23,673 --> 00:00:28,143
<i>I have a son, you have a daughter.</i>
<i>We'll join our houses.</i>

10
00:00:28,178 --> 00:00:30,879
The boy I beheaded--
he was talking madness.

11
00:00:30,914 --> 00:00:32,948
Said the others
slaughtered his friends.

12
00:00:32,982 --> 00:00:35,551
- Ned: A Wildling ambush.
- Maybe.

13
00:00:35,585 --> 00:00:36,961
You're Tyrion Lannister.

14
00:00:36,986 --> 00:00:39,279
You-- you're Ned Stark's
bastard, aren't you?

15
00:00:39,522 --> 00:00:41,590
Let me give you
some advice, bastard.

16
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:44,793
Never forget what you are and it
can never be used to hurt you.

17
00:00:44,828 --> 00:00:46,389
It's a direwolf.

18
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:48,136
There are no direwolves
south of the wall.

19
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,066
Now there are five, one for
each of the Stark children.

20
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:53,168
- What about you?
- I'm not a Stark.

21
00:00:53,203 --> 00:00:56,004
That one's yours, Snow.

22
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,641
May I present Viserys
of House Targaryen,

23
00:00:59,676 --> 00:01:01,376
the rightful King
of the Andals,

24
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:03,645
<i>and his sister Daenerys?</i>

25
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,582
I don't want to be his queen.
I want to go home.

26
00:01:06,616 --> 00:01:11,687
<i>We go home with an army--</i>
<i>with Khal Drogo's army.</i>

27
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:13,075
From your sister.

28
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,092
She says Jon Arryn was
murdered by the Lannisters.

29
00:01:16,192 --> 00:01:18,427
She says the King
is in danger.

30
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:20,295
What if Jon Arryn
told someone?

31
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,398
Whatever Jon Arryn knew
died with him.

32
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,771
The things I do for love.

Isn't there
anything else?

39
00:03:56,124 --> 00:03:58,626
The Dothraki have two things
in abundance:

40
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,430
Grass and horses.
People can't live on grass.

41

<i>In the Shadow Lands</i>
<i>beyond Asshai,</i>

42

<i>they say there are</i>
<i>fields of ghost grass</i>

43
00:04:16,578 --> 00:04:19,680
with stalks as pale as milk
that glow in the night.

44
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:22,349
It murders
all other grass.

45
00:04:22,384 --> 00:04:24,852
The Dothraki believe
that one day

46
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,122
it will cover everything--
that's the way the world will end.

47
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:43,170
It'll get easier.

48
00:05:21,276 --> 00:05:21,308
Khaleesi!

49

Your hands.

50
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,925
We're still not far
from Pentos, your Grace.

51
00:05:37,993 --> 00:05:40,427
Magister Illyrio has
extended his hospitality.

52
00:05:40,495 --> 00:05:42,496
You'd be more
comfortable there.

53
00:05:42,531 --> 00:05:44,932
I have no interest
in hospitality or comfort.

54
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:47,434
I'll stay with Drogo
until he fulfills

55
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:49,770
his end of the bargain
and I have my crown.

56
00:05:49,838 --> 00:05:52,173
As you wish, your Grace.

57
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:55,409
Well, Mormont,
as brutish as this life is,

58
00:05:55,443 --> 00:05:57,845
I suppose it is preferable
to beheading.

59
00:05:59,381 --> 00:06:01,615
What did Ned Stark
want you for?

60
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,617
Buying from a slaver?

61
00:06:03,685 --> 00:06:06,453
Selling to one--

62
00:06:06,521 --> 00:06:08,956
some poachers I caught
on my land.

63
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:13,694
Under my reign, you won't be
punished for such nonsense.

64
00:06:13,728 --> 00:06:16,063
You can rest assured
of that.

65
00:06:40,822 --> 00:06:43,657
Better-looking bitches
than you're used to, Uncle.

66
00:06:47,596 --> 00:06:50,197
My mother's been
looking for you.

67
00:06:50,232 --> 00:06:52,600
We ride for
King's Landing today.

68
00:06:52,634 --> 00:06:55,736
Before you go, you will call
on Lord and Lady Stark

69
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,838
and offer
your sympathies.

70
00:06:57,872 --> 00:07:00,808
What good will
my sympathies do them?

71
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,346
None. But it is
expected of you.

72
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,481
Your absence has
already been noted.

73
00:07:07,515 --> 00:07:09,650
The boy means
nothing to me.

74
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:12,119
And I can't stand
the wailing of women.

75
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:16,190
One word and I'll
hit you again.

76
00:07:16,224 --> 00:07:17,992
I'm telling mother!

77
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,462
Go!
Tell her.

78
00:07:21,496 --> 00:07:23,597
But first you will get
to Lord and Lady Stark

79
00:07:23,632 --> 00:07:25,633
and you will fall on your knees
in front of them

80
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:28,502
and tell them how very sorry you are,
that you are at their service,

81
00:07:28,536 --> 00:07:32,006
and that all your prayers are with them.
Do you understand?

82
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,208
You can't--

83
00:07:34,242 --> 00:07:35,809
Do you understand?

84
00:07:42,617 --> 00:07:44,785
The prince will
remember that, little lord.

85
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:46,820
I hope so.

86
00:07:46,855 --> 00:07:50,357
If he forgets, be a good dog
and remind him.

87
00:07:53,094 --> 00:07:56,230
Ah.
Time for breakfast.

88
00:08:03,271 --> 00:08:06,407
Bread.
And two of those little fish.

89
00:08:06,474 --> 00:08:09,877
And a mug of dark beer
to wash it down.

90
00:08:12,447 --> 00:08:14,515
And bacon,
burned black.

91
00:08:14,549 --> 00:08:16,517
Hyah.

92
00:08:16,551 --> 00:08:19,553
- Little brother.
- Beloved siblings.

93
00:08:23,925 --> 00:08:25,926
Is Bran going to die?

94
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:29,830
Apparently not.

95
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,602
- What do you mean?
- The Maester says the boy may live.

96
00:08:43,678 --> 00:08:46,747
It's no mercy, letting a child
linger in such pain.

97
00:08:46,781 --> 00:08:48,549
Only the gods
know for certain.

98
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,118
All the rest of us
can do is pray.

99
00:08:52,554 --> 00:08:55,122
The charms of the north
seem entirely lost on you.

100
00:08:55,156 --> 00:08:57,091
I still can't believe
you're going.

101
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,126
It's ridiculous
even for you.

102
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,894
Where's your sense
of wonder?

103
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:05,132
The greatest structure ever built,
the intrepid men of The Night's Watch,

104
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,735
the wintry abode
of the White Walkers.

105
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:10,704
Tell me you're not thinking
of taking the black.

106
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:13,640
And go celibate?
The whores would go begging

107
00:09:13,675 --> 00:09:15,776
from Dorne to Casterly Rock.

108
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,778
No, I just want to stand
on top of the wall

109
00:09:17,812 --> 00:09:19,913
and piss off
the edge of the world.

110
00:09:21,316 --> 00:09:23,984
The children don't need
to hear your filth.

111
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,654
Come.

112
00:09:33,762 --> 00:09:37,175
Even if the boy lives,
he'll be a cripple, a grotesque.

113
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:40,362
Give me a good
clean death any day.

114
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:44,838
Speaking for the grotesques,
I'd have to disagree.

115
00:09:44,906 --> 00:09:48,108
Death is so final,
whereas life...

116
00:09:48,143 --> 00:09:50,144
Ah, life is full
of possibilities.

117
00:09:51,546 --> 00:09:53,046
I hope the boy does wake.

118
00:09:53,081 --> 00:09:55,682
I'd be very interested
to hear what he has to say.

119
00:09:58,186 --> 00:10:00,053
My dear brother,

120
00:10:00,088 --> 00:10:02,756
there are times you make me
wonder whose side you're on.

121
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,125
<i>My</i> dear brother,
you wound me.

122
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,728
You know how much
I love my family.

123
00:10:26,948 --> 00:10:28,182
Please.

124
00:10:28,216 --> 00:10:31,618
Oh, I would have
dressed, your Grace.

125
00:10:31,653 --> 00:10:34,121
This is your home.
I'm your guest.

126
00:10:37,292 --> 00:10:39,326
Handsome one, isn't he?

127
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,164
I lost my first boy,
a little black-haired beauty.

128
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:47,301
He was a fighter too--

129
00:10:47,335 --> 00:10:50,671
tried to beat the fever
that took him.

130
00:10:50,738 --> 00:10:52,973
Forgive me.

131
00:10:53,007 --> 00:10:55,008
It's the last thing you
need to hear right now.

132
00:10:55,043 --> 00:10:57,277
I never knew.

133
00:10:57,312 --> 00:10:59,146
It was years ago.

134
00:11:00,715 --> 00:11:03,684
Robert was crazed, beat
his hands bloody on the wall,

135
00:11:03,751 --> 00:11:07,588
all the things men do to show
you how much they care.

136
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,661
The boy looked
just like him.

137
00:11:16,331 --> 00:11:19,032
Such a little thing...

138
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,935
A bird without feathers.

139
00:11:24,105 --> 00:11:28,942
They came to take his body away
and Robert held me.

140
00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:31,076
I screamed and I battled,
but he held me.

141
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:38,318
That little bundle.

142
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:42,589
They took him away
and I never saw him again.

143
00:11:42,624 --> 00:11:44,958
Never have visited
the crypt, never.

144
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,604
I pray to the mother
every morning and night

145
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,873
that she return
your child to you.

146
00:12:01,843 --> 00:12:03,544
I am grateful.

147
00:12:03,578 --> 00:12:06,647
Perhaps this time
she'll listen.

148
00:12:57,699 --> 00:12:59,733
A sword for the wall?

149
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:04,471
- I already have one.
- Good man.

150
00:13:04,505 --> 00:13:07,708
- Have you swung it yet?
- Of course I have.

151
00:13:07,742 --> 00:13:09,376
At someone, I mean.

152
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:17,050
It's a strange thing,
the first time you cut a man.

153
00:13:17,085 --> 00:13:20,253
You realize we're nothing
but sacks of meat

154
00:13:20,288 --> 00:13:23,724
and blood and some bone
to keep it all standing.

155
00:13:25,927 --> 00:13:28,095
Let me thank you
ahead of time

156
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:30,964
for guarding us all from
the perils beyond the wall--

157
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:33,600
Wildlings and White Walkers
and whatnot.

158
00:13:35,737 --> 00:13:37,371
We're grateful to have

159
00:13:37,405 --> 00:13:39,773
good, strong men like you
protecting us.

160
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,078
We've guarded the kingdoms
for 8,000 years.

161
00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:50,283
Is it "we" already?

162
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:53,487
Have you taken
your vows then?

163
00:13:53,521 --> 00:13:54,788
Soon enough.

164
00:13:57,091 --> 00:13:59,359
Give my regards
to The Night's Watch.

165
00:13:59,394 --> 00:14:02,829
I'm sure it will be thrilling
to serve in such an elite force.

166
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:04,798
And if not?

167
00:14:04,832 --> 00:14:07,701
It's only for life.

168
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:28,455
Thank you, Nymeria.

169
00:14:35,163 --> 00:14:38,131
Septa Mordane says
I have to do it again.

170
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,801
My things weren't
properly folded, she says.

171
00:14:40,835 --> 00:14:42,574
Who cares how they're folded?!

172
00:14:42,575 --> 00:14:44,000
They're going to get all
messed up anyway.

173
00:14:45,207 --> 00:14:46,373
It's good
you've got help.

174
00:14:46,374 --> 00:14:48,208
Watch.

175
00:14:48,242 --> 00:14:50,143
Nymeria, gloves.

176
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,251
- Impressive.
- Shut up.

177
00:14:58,286 --> 00:15:00,887
Nymeria, gloves!

178
00:15:02,223 --> 00:15:04,758
I have something for you.

179
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:07,127
And it has to be packed
very carefully.

180
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:08,962
A present?

181
00:15:08,996 --> 00:15:11,098
Close the door.

182
00:15:23,478 --> 00:15:25,946
This is no toy.

183
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:31,451
Be careful you don't
cut yourself.

184
00:15:34,188 --> 00:15:36,356
- It's so skinny.
- So are you.

185
00:15:37,592 --> 00:15:39,459
I had the blacksmith
make it for you special.

186
00:15:39,494 --> 00:15:40,961
<i>It won't hack</i>
<i>a man's head off,</i>

187
00:15:40,995 --> 00:15:43,130
but it can poke him full
of holes if you're quick enough.

188
00:15:43,164 --> 00:15:44,201
I can be quick.

189
00:15:44,226 --> 00:15:45,922
You'll have to work
at it every day.

190
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:48,535
How does it feel?

191
00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:51,238
Do you like
the balance?

192
00:15:51,272 --> 00:15:53,440
I think so.

193
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:57,277
First lesson: Stick them
with the pointy end.

194
00:15:57,311 --> 00:15:59,346
I know which end to use.

195
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:06,887
I'm going to miss you.

196
00:16:08,456 --> 00:16:09,890
Careful.

197
00:16:21,102 --> 00:16:24,037
All the best swords
have names, you know.

198
00:16:26,774 --> 00:16:29,409
Sansa can keep
her sewing needles.

199
00:16:30,878 --> 00:16:33,013
I've got a needle
of my own.

200
00:16:47,728 --> 00:16:49,830
I came to say
goodbye to Bran.

201
00:16:49,864 --> 00:16:51,598
You've said it.

202
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,345
I wish I could be here
when you wake up.

203
00:17:08,316 --> 00:17:10,851
I'm going north
with Uncle Benjen.

204
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:12,652
I'm taking the black.

205
00:17:21,562 --> 00:17:24,297
I know we always talked about
seeing the wall together,

206
00:17:24,332 --> 00:17:28,201
but you'll be able to come visit me
at Castle Black when you're better.

207
00:17:30,037 --> 00:17:32,372
I'll know my way
around by then.

208
00:17:32,406 --> 00:17:35,175
I'll be a sworn brother
of The Night's Watch.

209
00:17:40,248 --> 00:17:43,283
We can go out walking beyond the wall,
if you're not afraid.

210
00:17:57,899 --> 00:18:00,133
I want you

211
00:18:00,201 --> 00:18:01,801
to leave.

212
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:04,297
17 years ago

213
00:19:04,332 --> 00:19:06,499
you rode off
with Robert Baratheon.

214
00:19:08,703 --> 00:19:12,038
You came back a year later with
another woman's son.

215
00:19:13,507 --> 00:19:16,209
And now
you're leaving again.

216
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:20,647
I have no choice.

217
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:24,551
That's what men always say
when honor calls.

218
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:28,154
That's what you tell your families,
tell yourselves.

219
00:19:29,724 --> 00:19:32,058
You do have a choice.

220
00:19:32,093 --> 00:19:34,861
And you've made it.

221
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:40,033
Cat--

222
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:48,408
I can't do it, Ned.

223
00:19:51,379 --> 00:19:54,581
- I really can't.
- You can.

224
00:19:56,884 --> 00:19:58,685
You must.

225
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:24,644
You've said
goodbye to Bran?

226
00:20:24,678 --> 00:20:27,113
He's not going to die.
I know it.

227
00:20:27,148 --> 00:20:29,449
You Starks
are hard to kill.

228
00:20:30,351 --> 00:20:32,052
My mother?

229
00:20:32,086 --> 00:20:34,554
- She was very kind.
- Good.

230
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,558
Next time I see you,
you'll be all in black.

231
00:20:38,592 --> 00:20:40,760
It was always my color.

232
00:20:41,962 --> 00:20:45,098
- Farewell, Snow.
- And you, Stark.

233
00:21:37,551 --> 00:21:40,086
There's great honor serving
in The Night's Watch.

234
00:21:42,123 --> 00:21:45,558
<i>The Starks have manned the wall</i>
<i>for thousands of years.</i>

235
00:21:45,593 --> 00:21:48,561
And you are a Stark.

236
00:21:48,596 --> 00:21:50,830
You might not have my name,

237
00:21:50,898 --> 00:21:52,999
but you have my blood.

238
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,741
Is my mother alive?

239
00:22:01,775 --> 00:22:04,978
Does she know about me?
Where I am, where I'm going?

240
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,681
Does she care?

241
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,152
The next time
we see each other,

242
00:22:12,186 --> 00:22:14,521
we'll talk
about your mother.

243
00:22:14,555 --> 00:22:16,422
Huh?

244
00:22:16,457 --> 00:22:18,525
I promise.

245
00:22:58,132 --> 00:23:01,134
Gods, this is country!

246
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:06,472
I've half a mind to leave them
all behind and keep going.

247
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:10,910
I've half a mind
to go with you.

248
00:23:10,945 --> 00:23:12,979
What do you say,
just you and me

249
00:23:13,013 --> 00:23:15,548
on the Kingsroad,
swords at our sides,

250
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:19,152
a couple of tavern wenches
to warm our beds tonight.

251
00:23:19,186 --> 00:23:21,854
You should have
asked me 20 years ago.

252
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:24,757
There were wars to fight,
women to marry--

253
00:23:24,792 --> 00:23:26,859
we never had the chance
to be young.

254
00:23:26,894 --> 00:23:28,895
I recall
a few chances.

255
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:35,435
There was that one...
Oh, what was her name?

256
00:23:35,469 --> 00:23:37,437
That common girl of yours?

257
00:23:37,471 --> 00:23:40,273
Becca? With the great big tits
you could bury your face in.

258
00:23:40,341 --> 00:23:42,642
Bessie.
She was one of yours.

259
00:23:42,676 --> 00:23:46,312
Bessie!
Thank the gods for Bessie

260
00:23:46,347 --> 00:23:49,182
and her tits.

261
00:23:49,216 --> 00:23:51,618
Yours was... Aleena?

262
00:23:51,652 --> 00:23:54,721
No. You told me once.
Meryl?

263
00:23:54,755 --> 00:23:56,789
Your bastard's mother?

264
00:23:58,425 --> 00:24:00,693
- Wylla.
- <i>That's it.</i>

265
00:24:00,728 --> 00:24:02,895
<i>She must have been</i>
<i>a rare wench</i>

266
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:05,765
to make Lord Eddard Stark
forget his honor.

267
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:08,034
You never told me
what she looked like.

268
00:24:08,068 --> 00:24:10,436
Nor will I.

269
00:24:12,906 --> 00:24:14,774
We were at war.

270
00:24:14,808 --> 00:24:17,477
<i>None of us knew if we were</i>
<i>gonna go back home again.</i>

271
00:24:17,511 --> 00:24:20,980
You're too hard on yourself.
You always have been.

272
00:24:22,883 --> 00:24:26,085
I swear if I weren't your King,
you'd have hit me already.

273
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,155
The worst thing
about your coronation--

274
00:24:29,223 --> 00:24:31,758
I'll never get
to hit you again.

275
00:24:33,927 --> 00:24:36,496
Trust me, that's not
the worst thing.

276
00:24:40,467 --> 00:24:42,502
There was a rider
in the night.

277
00:24:48,575 --> 00:24:52,078
Daenerys Targaryen has wed
some Dothraki horselord.

278
00:24:52,112 --> 00:24:54,781
What of it?
Should we send her a wedding gift?

279
00:24:54,815 --> 00:24:56,516
A knife perhaps,
a good sharp one,

280
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,484
and a bold man to wield it.

281
00:24:58,552 --> 00:25:00,486
She's little more
than a child.

282
00:25:00,521 --> 00:25:03,756
Soon enough that child will spread
her legs and start breeding.

283
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:07,460
- Tell me we're not speaking of this.
- Oh, it's unspeakable to you?

284
00:25:07,494 --> 00:25:11,364
<i>What her father did to your family--</i>
<i>that was unspeakable.</i>

285
00:25:11,398 --> 00:25:13,466
What Rhaegar Targaryen
did to your sister--

286
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,635
<i>the woman I loved.</i>

287
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:18,938
I'll kill every Targaryen
I get my hands on.

288
00:25:18,972 --> 00:25:21,174
But you can't get
your hands on this one, can you?

289
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:23,142
This Khal Drogo,

290
00:25:23,177 --> 00:25:25,511
it's said he has 100,000 men
in his horde.

291
00:25:25,546 --> 00:25:28,314
Even a million Dothraki
are no threat to the realm,

292
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:31,150
as long as they remain on the
other side of the Narrow Sea.

293
00:25:31,185 --> 00:25:33,152
They have no ships,
Robert.

294
00:25:33,187 --> 00:25:36,356
There are still those in the
Seven Kingdoms who call me usurper.

295
00:25:37,891 --> 00:25:41,160
If the Targaryen boy crosses
with a Dothraki horde at his back,

296
00:25:41,195 --> 00:25:43,996
- the scum will join him.
- He will not cross.

297
00:25:45,699 --> 00:25:48,868
And if by chance he does,
we'll throw him back into the sea.

298
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,742
There's a war coming, Ned.

299
00:25:55,776 --> 00:25:57,610
<i>I don't know when,</i>

300
00:25:57,644 --> 00:26:00,179
I don't know who
we'll be fighting,

301
00:26:00,214 --> 00:26:01,714
but it's coming.

302
00:27:13,454 --> 00:27:15,354
Sit.

303
00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:17,390
You'll be fed.

304
00:27:20,694 --> 00:27:23,062
<i>Untie them.</i>

305
00:27:23,096 --> 00:27:26,566
Ah, rapers.

306
00:27:28,602 --> 00:27:32,405
They were given a choice no doubt--
castration or the wall.

307
00:27:32,473 --> 00:27:34,874
Most choose the knife.

308
00:27:39,513 --> 00:27:42,415
Not impressed
by your new brothers?

309
00:27:45,118 --> 00:27:47,053
<i>Lovely thing</i>
<i>about the watch--</i>

310
00:27:47,087 --> 00:27:50,590
you discard your old family
and get a whole new one.

311
00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:01,434
Why do you read so much?

312
00:28:01,468 --> 00:28:04,737
Look at me and tell me
what you see.

313
00:28:05,906 --> 00:28:07,773
Is this a trick?

314
00:28:07,841 --> 00:28:11,544
What you see is a dwarf.

315
00:28:11,578 --> 00:28:15,014
If I'd been born a peasant they might've
left me out in the woods to die.

316
00:28:15,048 --> 00:28:18,851
Alas, I was born a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.

317
00:28:18,886 --> 00:28:21,420
Things are expected of me.

318
00:28:21,455 --> 00:28:23,890
My father was the Hand
of the King for 20 years.

319
00:28:23,924 --> 00:28:26,125
Until your brother
killed that King.

320
00:28:31,632 --> 00:28:35,601
Yes, until my brother
killed him.

321
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,139
<i>Life is full of these</i>
<i>little ironies.</i>

322
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:43,309
My sister married
the new King

323
00:28:43,343 --> 00:28:46,546
and my repulsive nephew
will be King after him.

324
00:28:49,149 --> 00:28:52,451
I must do my part for the honor
of my house, wouldn't you agree?

325
00:28:54,154 --> 00:28:56,088
<i>But how?</i>

326
00:28:56,123 --> 00:28:58,925
Well, my brother
has his sword

327
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:00,826
and I have my mind.

328
00:29:00,894 --> 00:29:04,196
And a mind needs books
like a sword needs a whetstone.

329
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:07,333
That's why I read
so much, Jon Snow.

330
00:29:10,671 --> 00:29:13,139
And you?

331
00:29:13,173 --> 00:29:15,508
What's your story,
bastard?

332
00:29:17,711 --> 00:29:20,713
Ask me nicely and maybe
I'll tell you, dwarf.

333
00:29:24,484 --> 00:29:27,453
A bastard boy
with nothing to inherit,

334
00:29:27,487 --> 00:29:29,422
<i>off to join</i>

335
00:29:29,456 --> 00:29:31,924
<i>the ancient order</i>
<i>of The Night's Watch,</i>

336
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:35,928
alongside his Valiant
brothers-in-arms.

337
00:29:35,963 --> 00:29:38,030
The Night's Watch protects
the realm from--

338
00:29:38,065 --> 00:29:41,300
ah, yes yes, against grumpkins
and snarks

339
00:29:41,335 --> 00:29:44,770
and all the other monsters
your wet nurse warned you about.

340
00:29:44,805 --> 00:29:47,173
<i>You're a smart boy.</i>

341
00:29:47,207 --> 00:29:49,809
You don't believe
that nonsense.

342
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:00,286
Everything's better
with some wine in the belly.

343
00:30:34,688 --> 00:30:38,557
It's time we reviewed
the accounts, my lady.

344
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:42,728
You'll want to know how much
this royal visit has cost us.

345
00:30:44,297 --> 00:30:46,899
Talk to Poole about it.

346
00:30:48,235 --> 00:30:51,337
Poole went south
with Lord Stark, my lady.

347
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:54,073
<i>We need a new steward,</i>

348
00:30:54,107 --> 00:30:57,276
and there are several other
appointments that require

349
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:01,414
- our immediate attention--
- I don't care about appointments!

350
00:31:02,716 --> 00:31:04,583
I'll make the appointments.

351
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,235
We'll talk about it
first thing in the morning.

352
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,460
Very good, my Lord.

353
00:31:13,694 --> 00:31:15,327
My Lady.

354
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:30,409
When was the last time
you left this room?

355
00:31:30,444 --> 00:31:33,079
I have to take care
of him.

356
00:31:33,113 --> 00:31:34,980
He's not going
to die, mother.

357
00:31:34,981 --> 00:31:37,192
Maester Luwin says the most
dangerous time has passed.

358
00:31:37,193 --> 00:31:38,559
<i>What if he's wrong?</i>

359
00:31:38,655 --> 00:31:42,359
- Bran needs me.
- <i>Rickon needs you.</i>

360
00:31:42,422 --> 00:31:44,356
He's six.

361
00:31:44,391 --> 00:31:47,793
He doesn't know what's happening.
He follows me around all day,

362
00:31:47,828 --> 00:31:50,262
- clutching my leg, crying--
- close the windows!

363
00:31:50,297 --> 00:31:52,465
I can't stand it!
Please make them stop!

364
00:31:56,169 --> 00:31:58,671
Fire.

365
00:31:58,705 --> 00:32:00,873
You stay here.
I'll come back.

366
00:32:18,592 --> 00:32:21,093
You're not supposed
to be here.

367
00:32:21,128 --> 00:32:23,829
No one is
supposed to be here.

368
00:32:23,897 --> 00:32:27,466
It's a mercy.
He's dead already.

369
00:32:30,137 --> 00:32:32,838
No!

370
00:33:38,572 --> 00:33:42,341
- Have you ever seen a dragon?
- Dragon gone, Khaleesi.

371
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:45,411
<i>Everywhere?</i>
<i>Even in the east?</i>

372
00:33:45,445 --> 00:33:48,380
<i>No dragon.</i>
<i>Brave men kill them.</i>

373
00:33:48,415 --> 00:33:51,617
- <i>It is known.</i>
- It is known.

374
00:33:51,651 --> 00:33:55,688
A trader from Garth told me
that dragons come from the moon.

375
00:33:55,722 --> 00:33:58,057
The moon?

376
00:33:58,124 --> 00:34:00,292
He told me the moon
was an egg, Khaleesi,

377
00:34:00,327 --> 00:34:03,362
<i>that once there were</i>
<i>two moons in the sky.</i>

378
00:34:03,396 --> 00:34:07,233
But one wandered too close
to the sun and it cracked from the heat.

379
00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:10,502
Out of it poured a thousand
thousand dragons

380
00:34:10,537 --> 00:34:12,471
and they drank
the sun's fire.

381
00:34:12,505 --> 00:34:15,407
Moon is no egg.

382
00:34:15,442 --> 00:34:18,277
Moon is goddess--
wife of sun.

383
00:34:18,311 --> 00:34:21,080
- It is known.
- It is known.

384
00:34:22,616 --> 00:34:24,583
Leave me with her.

385
00:34:32,425 --> 00:34:35,694
Why did the trader from Garth
tell you these stories?

386
00:34:35,729 --> 00:34:38,931
Men like to talk
when they're happy.

387
00:34:38,965 --> 00:34:41,000
Before your brother
bought me for you,

388
00:34:41,034 --> 00:34:43,102
it was my job
to make men happy.

389
00:34:43,169 --> 00:34:46,338
- How old were you?
- I was nine

390
00:34:46,373 --> 00:34:48,374
when my mother sold me
to the pleasure house.

391
00:34:48,408 --> 00:34:49,909
Nine?!

392
00:34:49,943 --> 00:34:53,379
I did not touch a man
for three years, Khaleesi.

393
00:34:53,413 --> 00:34:54,947
First

394
00:34:54,981 --> 00:34:56,949
you must learn.

395
00:34:59,786 --> 00:35:03,289
Can you teach me how
to make the Khal happy?

396
00:35:04,491 --> 00:35:08,394
- Yes.
- Will it take three years?

397
00:35:09,796 --> 00:35:11,463
No.

398
00:35:32,919 --> 00:35:35,120
Welcome.

399
00:37:05,512 --> 00:37:09,081
What I am about to tell
you must remain between us.

400
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:13,218
I don't think Bran
fell from that tower.

401
00:37:14,421 --> 00:37:16,422
I think he was thrown.

402
00:37:17,757 --> 00:37:20,526
The boy was always
sure-footed before.

403
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,295
Someone tried
to kill him twice.

404
00:37:23,329 --> 00:37:26,432
<i>Why?</i>
<i>Why murder an innocent child?</i>

405
00:37:26,466 --> 00:37:29,201
Unless he saw something
he wasn't meant to see.

406
00:37:29,235 --> 00:37:31,937
- Saw what, my lady?
- I don't know.

407
00:37:33,506 --> 00:37:35,741
<i>But I would stake my life</i>
<i>the Lannisters are involved.</i>

408
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:39,211
We already have reason
to suspect their loyalty to the crown.

409
00:37:39,245 --> 00:37:41,547
Did you notice the dagger
the killer used?

410
00:37:41,581 --> 00:37:44,016
It's too fine a weapon
for such a man.

411
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:47,352
The blade is Valyrian steel,
the handle dragonbone.

412
00:37:47,387 --> 00:37:49,288
Someone gave it to him.

413
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:54,226
They come into our home
and try to murder my brother?

414
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,481
If it's war they want--

415
00:37:56,506 --> 00:37:58,194
If it comes to that, you know
I'll stand behind you.

416
00:37:58,198 --> 00:38:01,066
What, is there going to be
a battle in the Godswood?

417
00:38:01,101 --> 00:38:03,068
<i>Huh?</i>

418
00:38:03,103 --> 00:38:06,071
Too easily words of war
become acts of war.

419
00:38:06,106 --> 00:38:08,140
<i>We don't know</i>
<i>the truth yet.</i>

420
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:10,742
Lord Stark
must be told of this.

421
00:38:10,777 --> 00:38:13,712
I don't trust a raven
to carry these words.

422
00:38:13,746 --> 00:38:15,647
- I'll ride to King's Landing.
- No.

423
00:38:15,682 --> 00:38:18,984
There must always be
a Stark in Winterfell.

424
00:38:19,018 --> 00:38:21,320
- I will go myself.
- Mother, you can't.

425
00:38:21,387 --> 00:38:23,522
I must.

426
00:38:23,556 --> 00:38:26,258
I'll send hal with a squad
of guardsmen to escort you.

427
00:38:26,292 --> 00:38:28,794
Too large a party attracts
unwanted attention.

428
00:38:28,828 --> 00:38:31,130
I don't want the Lannisters
to know I'm coming.

429
00:38:31,164 --> 00:38:32,998
Let me accompany you
at least.

430
00:38:33,032 --> 00:38:35,934
<i>The Kingsroad can be a</i>
<i>dangerous place for a woman alone.</i>

431
00:38:39,672 --> 00:38:42,007
What about Bran?

432
00:38:43,543 --> 00:38:46,645
I have prayed to the seven
for more than a month.

433
00:38:47,814 --> 00:38:51,183
<i>Bran's life is</i>
<i>in their hands now.</i>

434
00:39:49,876 --> 00:39:52,144
No, Khaleesi.

435
00:39:52,178 --> 00:39:54,980
You must look
in his eyes always.

436
00:39:55,014 --> 00:39:57,049
Love comes in at the eyes.

437
00:39:57,083 --> 00:40:01,520
It is said that Irogenia of Lys
could finish a man

438
00:40:01,554 --> 00:40:03,589
with nothing
but her eyes.

439
00:40:03,623 --> 00:40:05,924
Finish a man?

440
00:40:07,427 --> 00:40:09,528
Oh.

441
00:40:09,562 --> 00:40:14,099
Kings traveled across
the world for a night with Irogenia.

442
00:40:14,133 --> 00:40:16,768
Magisters sold
their palaces.

443
00:40:16,803 --> 00:40:20,539
<i>Khals burned her enemies</i>
<i>just to have her for a few hours.</i>

444
00:40:20,573 --> 00:40:24,343
They say a thousand men
proposed to her

445
00:40:24,377 --> 00:40:27,212
and she refused them all.

446
00:40:27,247 --> 00:40:30,816
Well, she sounds like
an interesting woman.

447
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,784
I-- I don't think

448
00:40:32,819 --> 00:40:35,087
that Drogo will like it
with me on top.

449
00:40:35,121 --> 00:40:37,623
You will make him
like it, Khaleesi.

450
00:40:37,657 --> 00:40:39,891
Men want what
they've never had.

451
00:40:39,926 --> 00:40:43,128
And the Dothraki take slaves
like a hound takes a bitch.

452
00:40:43,162 --> 00:40:46,632
Are you a slave,
Khaleesi?

453
00:40:57,243 --> 00:41:00,112
Then don't make love
like a slave.

454
00:41:08,488 --> 00:41:10,856
Very good, Khaleesi.

455
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:13,058
Out there
he is the mighty Khal,

456
00:41:13,092 --> 00:41:17,162
<i>but in this tent,</i>
<i>he belongs to you.</i>

457
00:41:17,196 --> 00:41:19,431
I-- I don't think

458
00:41:19,465 --> 00:41:21,533
that this is
the Dothraki way.

459
00:41:21,567 --> 00:41:24,136
If he wanted
the Dothraki way,

460
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:27,172
why did he marry you?

461
00:42:15,621 --> 00:42:18,490
No.

462
00:42:20,893 --> 00:42:22,794
No!

463
00:42:22,829 --> 00:42:27,499
<i>Ajjalan anha zalat</i>
<i>vitiherat yer hatif.</i>

464
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,774
Pardon me, Ser.

465
00:44:19,612 --> 00:44:21,947
Do I frighten you
so much, girl?

466
00:44:23,649 --> 00:44:26,418
Or is it him there
making you shake?

467
00:44:26,452 --> 00:44:29,054
He frightens
me too.

468
00:44:29,088 --> 00:44:31,556
Look at
that face.

469
00:44:31,591 --> 00:44:34,359
I'm sorry
if I offended you, Ser.

470
00:44:40,967 --> 00:44:42,935
Why won't he speak to me?

471
00:44:42,936 --> 00:44:45,136
He hasn't been very talkative
these last 20 years.

472
00:44:45,137 --> 00:44:48,206
Since the mad King had his tongue
ripped out with hot pincers.

473
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:50,976
He speaks damn well
with his sword though.

474
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:54,779
Ser Ilyn Payne,
the King's justice.

475
00:44:56,282 --> 00:44:58,416
The royal
executioner.

476
00:44:59,719 --> 00:45:02,888
What is it, sweet lady?

477
00:45:04,457 --> 00:45:06,525
Does the hound frighten you?

478
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:08,260
Away with you, dog.

479
00:45:08,294 --> 00:45:10,962
You're scaring
my lady.

480
00:45:13,165 --> 00:45:15,300
I don't like
to see you upset.

481
00:45:17,803 --> 00:45:19,604
The Sun is finally shining.

482
00:45:19,639 --> 00:45:21,406
Come walk with me.

483
00:45:23,342 --> 00:45:25,477
Stay, lady.

484
00:45:42,128 --> 00:45:44,329
I probably shouldn't
have any more.

485
00:45:44,363 --> 00:45:46,731
Father only lets us
have one cup at feasts.

486
00:45:46,766 --> 00:45:49,834
My princess can drink
as much as she wants.

487
00:46:02,248 --> 00:46:05,016
Don't worry--
you're safe with me.

488
00:46:06,018 --> 00:46:08,119
I'll get you!

489
00:46:13,292 --> 00:46:16,227
- Arya!
- Ow!

490
00:46:16,262 --> 00:46:17,829
What are you doing here?

491
00:46:17,863 --> 00:46:20,332
- Go away.
- Your sister?

492
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:26,871
- And who are you, boy?
- Mycah, my Lord.

493
00:46:26,906 --> 00:46:29,007
- He the butcher's boy.
- He's my friend.

494
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:32,510
A butcher's boy who wants
to be a Knight, eh?

495
00:46:34,113 --> 00:46:36,948
Pick up your sword, butcher's boy.
Let's see how good you are.

496
00:46:36,983 --> 00:46:39,584
She asked me to, my Lord.
She asked me to.

497
00:46:39,619 --> 00:46:41,586
I'm your prince,

498
00:46:41,621 --> 00:46:43,555
not your lord,

499
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:47,192
and I said pick up
your sword.

500
00:46:47,259 --> 00:46:49,594
It's not a sword, my prince.
It's only a stick.

501
00:46:49,629 --> 00:46:51,496
And you're not a Knight.

502
00:46:52,832 --> 00:46:55,066
Only a butcher's boy.

503
00:46:55,101 --> 00:46:58,136
That was my lady's sister
you were hitting, do you know that?

504
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:00,505
- Stop it!
- Arya, stay out of this.

505
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,208
I won't hurt him...

506
00:47:03,242 --> 00:47:04,843
Much.

507
00:47:13,352 --> 00:47:14,619
Arya!

508
00:47:15,621 --> 00:47:17,022
Filthy little bitch!

509
00:47:17,056 --> 00:47:18,957
No no, stop it, stop it,
both of you.

510
00:47:18,991 --> 00:47:22,327
You're spoiling it.
You're spoiling everything!

511
00:47:22,361 --> 00:47:24,996
I'll gut you,
you little cunt!

512
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,801
- Arya!
- Nymeria!

513
00:47:29,835 --> 00:47:32,404
- Arya!
- Nymeria!

514
00:47:37,276 --> 00:47:39,210
No.

515
00:47:39,245 --> 00:47:41,846
No.
Please don't.

516
00:47:41,881 --> 00:47:44,315
Arya, leave him alone.

517
00:48:02,902 --> 00:48:06,371
My prince, my poor prince,
look what they did to you.

518
00:48:06,405 --> 00:48:08,840
Stay here, I'll go back
to the inn and bring help.

519
00:48:08,874 --> 00:48:10,208
Then go!

520
00:48:12,011 --> 00:48:14,446
Don't touch me.

521
00:48:16,449 --> 00:48:19,417
<i>The wolf's not here.
Look down by the stream.</i>

522
00:48:25,424 --> 00:48:29,394
You've got to go. They'll kill you for
what you did to Joffrey.

523
00:48:29,428 --> 00:48:31,563
Go on-- run.

524
00:48:34,667 --> 00:48:36,835
Go!
Leave now!

525
00:48:38,938 --> 00:48:41,406
- <i>It's a direwolf.</i>
- <i>I'll check down here.</i>

526
00:48:46,979 --> 00:48:50,582
<i>I think I heard a noise.</i>

527
00:48:52,151 --> 00:48:53,785
<i>Go!</i>

528
00:49:05,765 --> 00:49:08,900
<i>Arya!</i>

529
00:49:08,934 --> 00:49:13,638
- Distant man: <i>Arya!</i>
- Ned: <i>Arya!</i>

530
00:49:13,672 --> 00:49:16,574
<i>Arya-aa!</i>

531
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:19,778
Arya!

532
00:49:19,812 --> 00:49:21,546
<i>Arya!</i>

533
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:23,515
My lord!

534
00:49:23,549 --> 00:49:25,950
My lord!
They found her.

535
00:49:25,985 --> 00:49:28,453
She's unharmed.

536
00:49:28,487 --> 00:49:30,005
Where is she?

537
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:31,756
She's been taken
directly before the King.

538
00:49:31,811 --> 00:49:33,645
- Who took her?
- The Lannisters found her.

539
00:49:33,921 --> 00:49:36,089
- <i>Arya-aa!</i>
- Right, get back.

540
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:38,539
<i>The Queen ordered</i>
<i>them to bring her straight to him.</i>

541
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,995
Back!
Back to the inn.

542
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,067
All back!

543
00:49:50,709 --> 00:49:52,577
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

544
00:49:52,611 --> 00:49:54,345
<i>- Are you hurt?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

545
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:56,915
Oh, it's all right.

546
00:49:58,617 --> 00:50:01,352
What is
the meaning of this?

547
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:04,139
Why was my daughter
not brought to me at once?

548
00:50:04,513 --> 00:50:06,153
How dare you speak
to your King in that manner?

549
00:50:06,178 --> 00:50:07,378
Quiet, woman.

550
00:50:08,327 --> 00:50:11,229
Sorry, Ned.
I never meant to frighten the girl.

551
00:50:11,263 --> 00:50:13,531
But we need to get
this business done quickly.

552
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:17,168
Your girl and that butcher's boy
attacked my son.

553
00:50:17,203 --> 00:50:19,838
That animal of hers
nearly tore his arm off.

554
00:50:19,872 --> 00:50:21,806
That's not true!

555
00:50:21,841 --> 00:50:24,309
She just...
Bit him a little.

556
00:50:24,343 --> 00:50:27,946
- He was hurting Mycah.
- Joff told us what happened.

557
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,881
You and that boy
beat him with clubs

558
00:50:29,915 --> 00:50:32,784
- while you set your wolf on him.
- That's not what happened!

559
00:50:32,818 --> 00:50:34,444
Yes it is!

560
00:50:34,469 --> 00:50:36,219
They all attacked me and she
threw my sword in the river.

561
00:50:36,222 --> 00:50:37,488
- Liar!
- Shut up!

562
00:50:37,523 --> 00:50:38,923
<i>Enough!</i>

563
00:50:38,958 --> 00:50:41,993
He tells me one thing,
she tells me another.

564
00:50:42,027 --> 00:50:44,395
Seven hells!
What am I to make of this?

565
00:50:46,465 --> 00:50:48,523
Where's your
other daughter, Ned?

566
00:50:48,548 --> 00:50:49,900
In bed asleep.

567
00:50:50,363 --> 00:50:51,664
She's not.

568
00:50:52,556 --> 00:50:54,891
Sansa, come here, darling.

569
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:06,851
Now, child...

570
00:51:07,753 --> 00:51:09,821
Tell me what happened.

571
00:51:09,855 --> 00:51:11,923
Tell it all
and tell it true.

572
00:51:11,957 --> 00:51:14,592
It's a great crime
to lie to a King.

573
00:51:23,002 --> 00:51:24,936
I don't know.

574
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:28,406
I don't remember.
Everything happened so fast.

575
00:51:29,308 --> 00:51:31,776
- I didn't see.
- Liar!

576
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:33,278
- Liar liar liar!
- Arya!

577
00:51:33,312 --> 00:51:35,613
- Hey, stop it! That's enough of that.
- Liar liar liar!

578
00:51:35,648 --> 00:51:40,009
- Stop! Arya!
- She's as wild as that animal of hers.

579
00:51:40,086 --> 00:51:41,107
<i>I want her punished.</i>

580
00:51:41,108 --> 00:51:43,840
What would you have me do,
whip her through the streets?

581
00:51:44,362 --> 00:51:47,064
Damn it, children fight.
It's over.

582
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,702
Joffrey will bear these scars
for the rest of his life.

583
00:51:51,371 --> 00:51:55,007
You let that
little girl disarm you?

584
00:52:01,014 --> 00:52:04,150
Ned, see to it that
your daughter is disciplined.

585
00:52:04,184 --> 00:52:07,053
- I'll do the same with my son.
- Gladly, your Grace.

586
00:52:08,288 --> 00:52:10,923
And what of the direwolf?

587
00:52:10,958 --> 00:52:13,559
What of the beast
that savaged your son?

588
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:18,931
I'd forgot
the damned wolf.

589
00:52:18,966 --> 00:52:21,734
We found no trace
of the direwolf, your Grace.

590
00:52:21,768 --> 00:52:25,037
No?
So be it.

591
00:52:25,072 --> 00:52:27,240
We have another wolf.

592
00:52:30,544 --> 00:52:32,178
As you will.

593
00:52:32,212 --> 00:52:35,414
- You can't mean it.
- A direwolf's no pet.

594
00:52:35,449 --> 00:52:37,884
Get her a dog.
She'll be happier for it.

595
00:52:39,019 --> 00:52:41,387
He doesn't mean Lady,
does he?

596
00:52:41,421 --> 00:52:44,423
No no, not lady!
Lady didn't bite anyone!

597
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:46,359
- She's good!
- Lady wasn't there!

598
00:52:46,393 --> 00:52:49,762
- <i>You leave her alone!</i>
- Stop them. Don't let them do it.

599
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:52,565
Please please,
it wasn't Lady!

600
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:54,100
Is this your command--

601
00:52:55,168 --> 00:52:56,702
your Grace?

602
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:06,646
- Where is the beast?
- Chained up outside, your Grace.

603
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,848
Ser Ilyn,
do me the honor.

604
00:53:08,882 --> 00:53:11,183
No.

605
00:53:11,218 --> 00:53:13,586
Jory...

606
00:53:14,688 --> 00:53:16,722
Take the girls
to their rooms.

607
00:53:20,928 --> 00:53:23,529
If it must be done,

608
00:53:23,563 --> 00:53:25,531
then I'll do it myself.

609
00:53:25,565 --> 00:53:27,767
Is this some trick?

610
00:53:27,801 --> 00:53:30,736
The wolf is of the north.

611
00:53:30,771 --> 00:53:33,873
She deserves better
than a butcher.

612
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,175
The butcher's boy--

613
00:54:09,242 --> 00:54:10,910
you rode him down?

614
00:54:10,944 --> 00:54:13,079
He ran...

615
00:54:13,113 --> 00:54:14,814
Not very fast.
