2
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:04,604
Thousands of years ago,
the First Men stood here.

3
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:06,673
They came here to get
away from something.

4
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:08,176
And I don't think it worked.

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,611
Your sword.

6
00:00:09,645 --> 00:00:12,117
<i>The Kingslayer,</i>
<i>he escaped in the night.</i>

7
00:00:12,142 --> 00:00:12,914
How?

8
00:00:12,915 --> 00:00:15,351
Jaime Lannister has
played you for a fool.

9
00:00:15,385 --> 00:00:17,886
Sansa and Arya are captives
in King's Landing.

10
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:20,657
<i>Returning him may buy</i>
<i>life for my children.</i>

11
00:00:20,691 --> 00:00:23,194
A girl owes one more name.
Give a man a name.

12
00:00:23,228 --> 00:00:26,297
- Jaqen H'ghar.
- A girl gives a man his own name?

13
00:00:26,331 --> 00:00:28,766
I'll un-name you if you help
me and my friends escape.

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,869
<i>A girl and her friends will</i>
<i>walk through the gate at midnight.</i>

15
00:00:31,903 --> 00:00:35,273
<i>Who was that out there</i>
<i>hung up at the gates?</i>

16
00:00:35,307 --> 00:00:37,508
Must have been
the farmer's boys.

17
00:00:37,542 --> 00:00:38,776
<i>Killed them, burned them,</i>

18
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,878
<i>and passed them off</i>
<i>as the little lords?</i>

19
00:00:40,912 --> 00:00:43,380
Got as far as the farm
then doubled back.

20
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:46,016
Hoped this would be the last
place they'd think to look.

21
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:48,852
My bastard is only a few
days from Winterfell.

22
00:00:48,887 --> 00:00:50,788
- Once he captures the castle--
- Theon has my brothers.

23
00:00:50,822 --> 00:00:53,824
- If we storm the castle--
- he wouldn't dare hurt the boys.

24
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:56,495
There is only hope of escaping
the North with his head.

25
00:00:56,529 --> 00:00:57,963
Send word to your son.

26
00:00:57,997 --> 00:01:00,133
Any Ironborn
who surrender will be allowed

27
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:01,901
to return safely
to their homes.

28
00:01:01,935 --> 00:01:04,270
With the exception
of Theon Greyjoy.

29
00:01:04,305 --> 00:01:07,440
I expect his countrymen will turn on
him the minute they hear the offer.

30
00:01:07,475 --> 00:01:09,443
Mance is gonna march
on the wall.

31
00:01:09,477 --> 00:01:11,545
When he does,
one brother inside his army

32
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:13,213
will be worth 1,000
fighting against him.

33
00:01:13,247 --> 00:01:15,148
- They'll never trust me.
- They might.

34
00:01:15,183 --> 00:01:17,117
- If you do what needs to be done.
- What?

35
00:01:17,151 --> 00:01:21,221
I should have known better,
trusting a traitor's bastard!

36
00:01:22,424 --> 00:01:24,758
He's not yours
to kill, crow.

37
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,360
I don't want to marry
the Frey girl.

38
00:01:26,394 --> 00:01:27,928
I don't want you
to marry her.

39
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,932
If you enter that place,
you will never leave again.

40
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,623
If my dragons are in
the House of the Undying,

41
00:01:34,624 --> 00:01:35,429
then take me there.

42
00:01:35,437 --> 00:01:36,971
That's what
the warlock wants.

43
00:01:37,005 --> 00:01:40,475
- His magic is strong.
- And what of my magic?

44
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:42,511
They're coming ashore.
There are too many.

45
00:01:42,545 --> 00:01:43,812
Rain fire on them.

46
00:01:56,361 --> 00:02:00,132
The battle is over.
We have won.

47
00:02:06,641 --> 00:02:08,809

Pod!

53
00:04:30,495 --> 00:04:32,763
Find Bronn or Varys.

<i>Tell them I am here</i>

56
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:42,675
Yes, My Lord.

57
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:45,946
Would you like
something for the pain?

58
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:49,216
What happened?

59
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,019
The murderer and traitor
Stannis Baratheon

60
00:04:52,054 --> 00:04:56,557
suffered a stunning defeat
at the hands of your father.

61
00:04:58,593 --> 00:05:00,193
Where am I?

62
00:05:00,227 --> 00:05:03,129
These are your new chambers.

63
00:05:03,164 --> 00:05:06,099
A little cramped,
perhaps,

64
00:05:06,134 --> 00:05:08,502
but you don't need
much room, do you?

65
00:05:08,536 --> 00:05:12,172
<i>You are no longer</i>
<i>Hand of the King.</i>

66
00:05:16,445 --> 00:05:18,412
Oh.

67
00:05:20,615 --> 00:05:22,216
For your trouble.

68
00:05:46,942 --> 00:05:50,612
<i>I, Joffrey of the House</i>
<i>Baratheon, first of my name,</i>

69
00:05:50,646 --> 00:05:53,047
the rightful King
of the Andals

70
00:05:53,081 --> 00:05:54,848
and the First Men,

71
00:05:54,882 --> 00:05:56,850
Lord of the Seven
Kingdoms

72
00:05:56,884 --> 00:05:58,451
and protector
of the Realm,

73
00:05:58,486 --> 00:06:00,786
<i>do hereby proclaim</i>
<i>my grandfather</i>

74
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,389
<i>Tywin Lannister</i>
<i>the savior of the city</i>

75
00:06:04,424 --> 00:06:06,891
and the Hand of the King.

76
00:06:19,271 --> 00:06:20,972
Thank you, Your Grace.

77
00:06:31,117 --> 00:06:33,585
Lord Petyr Baelish,
step forward.

78
00:06:35,088 --> 00:06:38,290
For your good service
and ingenuity

79
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:40,893
in uniting the Houses
of Lannister and Tyrell,

80
00:06:40,927 --> 00:06:43,896
<i>I declare that you shall be granted</i>
<i>the castle of Harrenhal...</i>

81
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,632
<i>With all its attendant</i>
<i>lands and incomes</i>

82
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,701
<i>to be held by your sons</i>
<i>and grandsons</i>

83
00:06:48,735 --> 00:06:51,537
from this day until
the end of time.

84
00:06:51,571 --> 00:06:54,139
You honor me
beyond words, Your Grace.

85
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:59,945
I shall have to acquire
some sons and grandsons.

86
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,951
Ser Loras Tyrell.

87
00:07:10,859 --> 00:07:13,493
Your House has come
to our aid.

88
00:07:13,528 --> 00:07:15,229
The whole realm
is in your debt,

89
00:07:15,263 --> 00:07:17,164
none more so than I.

90
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:20,168
If your family would ask
anything of me, ask it

91
00:07:20,202 --> 00:07:22,270
and it shall be yours.

92
00:07:22,304 --> 00:07:24,606
Your Grace,

93
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,175
my sister Margaery,

94
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:28,811
her husband was taken
from us before...

95
00:07:30,014 --> 00:07:31,915
She remains innocent.

96
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,284
I would ask you to
find it in your heart

97
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,387
to do us the great honor
of joining our Houses.

98
00:07:39,357 --> 00:07:42,326
Is this what you want,
Lady Margaery?

99
00:07:44,796 --> 00:07:48,165
With all my heart,
Your Grace.

100
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,868
I have come to love
you from afar.

101
00:07:50,902 --> 00:07:53,404
Tales of your
courage and wisdom

102
00:07:53,438 --> 00:07:55,239
<i>have never been</i>
<i>far from my ears.</i>

103
00:07:55,273 --> 00:08:00,376
And those tales have taken
root deep inside of me.

104
00:08:02,646 --> 00:08:07,716
Well, I too have heard tales
of your beauty and grace,

105
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,085
<i>but the tales</i>

106
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:12,654
do not do you justice,
My Lady.

107
00:08:12,688 --> 00:08:17,593
<i>It would be an honor</i>
<i>to return your love,</i>

108
00:08:17,627 --> 00:08:20,162
but I am promised
to another.

109
00:08:21,298 --> 00:08:22,932
A King must keep
his word.

110
00:08:22,966 --> 00:08:26,836
Your Grace, in the judgment
of your small council,

111
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,038
it would be neither
proper nor wise

112
00:08:29,072 --> 00:08:32,608
for you to wed the daughter
of a man beheaded for treason,

113
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:35,110
a girl whose brother
is in open rebellion

114
00:08:35,145 --> 00:08:37,412
against the throne
as we speak.

115
00:08:37,447 --> 00:08:39,948
For the good
of the realm,

116
00:08:39,982 --> 00:08:43,184
your councilors
beg you...

117
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,787
to set Sansa Stark aside.

118
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,026
- Margaery!
- We want Margaery!

119
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:57,430
<i>I would like to heed</i>
<i>your wishes</i>

120
00:08:57,465 --> 00:08:59,900
<i>and the wishes</i>
<i>of my people,</i>

121
00:08:59,934 --> 00:09:02,770
but I took
a holy vow.

122
00:09:02,804 --> 00:09:04,805
<i>Your Grace,</i>

123
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:08,675
the Gods do indeed
hold betrothal solemn,

124
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:13,147
but your father,
blessed be his memory,

125
00:09:13,181 --> 00:09:16,317
made this pact
before the Starks

126
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:19,987
revealed their falseness.

127
00:09:20,022 --> 00:09:23,324
<i>I have consulted</i>
<i>with the High Septon</i>

128
00:09:23,358 --> 00:09:27,629
and he assures me that their
crimes against the realm

129
00:09:27,663 --> 00:09:31,499
<i>free you from any promise</i>
<i>you have made to them</i>

130
00:09:31,534 --> 00:09:35,469
<i>in the sight</i>
<i>of the Gods.</i>

131
00:09:35,504 --> 00:09:38,038
The Gods are good.

132
00:09:38,073 --> 00:09:40,575
I am free
to heed my heart.

133
00:09:40,609 --> 00:09:45,146
<i>Ser Loras, I will gladly</i>
<i>wed your sweet sister.</i>

134
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,947
<i>You will be my Queen</i>

135
00:09:46,982 --> 00:09:50,550
and I will love you
from this day

136
00:09:50,585 --> 00:09:52,652
until my last day.

137
00:10:15,145 --> 00:10:18,080
My Lady.

138
00:10:18,114 --> 00:10:20,949
<i>My sincerest condolences.</i>

139
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:23,418
They're right--
I'm not good enough for him.

140
00:10:23,452 --> 00:10:25,153
You shouldn't say that.

141
00:10:25,187 --> 00:10:27,655
You'll be good enough
for many things.

142
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:29,923
He'll still enjoy
beating you.

143
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:32,926
And now that
you're a woman,

144
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,063
he'll be able to enjoy you
in other ways as well.

145
00:10:36,097 --> 00:10:39,066
But if he's not
marrying me--

146
00:10:39,101 --> 00:10:42,370
He'll let you go home?

147
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:45,808
Joffrey's not the sort of boy
who gives away his toys.

148
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,744
You have a tender heart,

149
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:51,714
just like your mother
did at your age.

150
00:10:51,748 --> 00:10:55,218
I can see so much
of her in you.

151
00:10:55,252 --> 00:10:58,086
She was like
a sister to me.

152
00:10:58,121 --> 00:11:00,989
For her sake,

153
00:11:01,024 --> 00:11:04,192
I'll help get you home.

154
00:11:06,662 --> 00:11:09,729
King's Landing
is my home now.

155
00:11:10,965 --> 00:11:13,166
Look around you.

156
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,335
We're all liars here.

157
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:19,639
And every one of us
is better than you.

158
00:11:30,918 --> 00:11:33,286
Come in.

159
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,588
Make yourself
comfortable.

160
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:45,062
That doesn't look
very comfortable.

161
00:11:45,097 --> 00:11:48,098
Here, watch me.

162
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,970
No need for that,
my dear.

163
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,439
You sure?

164
00:11:55,473 --> 00:11:57,441
Most men like
what they see.

165
00:11:57,475 --> 00:11:59,110
I'm not like
most men.

166
00:11:59,144 --> 00:12:01,612
<i>That's what most men say.</i>

167
00:12:01,647 --> 00:12:05,116
If you don't want
what most men want,

168
00:12:05,151 --> 00:12:07,820
then you'd better tell me
what you'd like me to do.

169
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:12,859
I would like you to tell me
if working for Lord Baelish

170
00:12:12,893 --> 00:12:15,328
has been all you'd
hoped it would be.

171
00:12:16,597 --> 00:12:18,064
Have we met?

172
00:12:18,098 --> 00:12:20,800
You wouldn't
remember me if we had?

173
00:12:20,835 --> 00:12:22,468
I meet a lot of men.

174
00:12:22,503 --> 00:12:24,971
And I think you
remember all of them.

175
00:12:25,005 --> 00:12:28,608
I think your true talents
are wasted on them.

176
00:12:28,642 --> 00:12:31,411
You're very kind,
My Lord.

177
00:12:31,478 --> 00:12:33,879
Allow me to return
the favor.

178
00:12:40,788 --> 00:12:42,755
You're afraid.

179
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:45,591
Why?
Nothing dangerous down there.

180
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:48,027
I know who you are.

181
00:12:48,061 --> 00:12:51,230
And, unlike your
current employer,

182
00:12:51,264 --> 00:12:53,966
I protect those
who work for me.

183
00:12:54,001 --> 00:12:57,070
I don't abuse them
to satisfy royal whims

184
00:12:57,104 --> 00:12:59,672
or force them
to abuse each other.

185
00:12:59,707 --> 00:13:01,441
How do you know
about that?

186
00:13:01,475 --> 00:13:04,945
I thought you said
you knew who I was.

187
00:13:06,814 --> 00:13:09,116
What can I do for you,
Lord Varys?

188
00:13:21,862 --> 00:13:23,563
Littlefinger looks at you

189
00:13:23,597 --> 00:13:26,032
and sees a collection
of profitable holes.

190
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:29,435
I see a potential
partner.

191
00:13:30,804 --> 00:13:34,874
- I'm afraid of him.
- Oh, you should be.

192
00:13:34,908 --> 00:13:37,577
He's a dangerous man.

193
00:13:37,611 --> 00:13:40,880
But everyone has
their weaknesses.

194
00:13:40,914 --> 00:13:45,085
Your current employer
hides his very well,

195
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:47,554
but not as well
as he thinks.

196
00:13:52,027 --> 00:13:54,296
You're a virgin,
I take it?

197
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,397
Walk.

198
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,101
Childhood must have
been awful for you.

199
00:14:00,135 --> 00:14:03,338
Were you a foot taller
than all the boys?

200
00:14:03,372 --> 00:14:06,341
They laughed at you,
called you names?

201
00:14:06,376 --> 00:14:08,644
Some boys
like a challenge.

202
00:14:08,678 --> 00:14:12,115
One or two must have
tried to get inside big Brienne.

203
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:15,185
- One or two tried.
- Ah.

204
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:17,420
But you fought them off.

205
00:14:17,455 --> 00:14:20,490
But maybe you wished one
of them could overpower you,

206
00:14:20,524 --> 00:14:22,959
fling you down,
tear off your clothes.

207
00:14:22,994 --> 00:14:25,395
But none of them
were strong enough.

208
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,698
- I'm strong enough.
- Not interested.

209
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,267
Of course you are.

210
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:32,003
You'd love to know what it
feels like to be a woman.

211
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:38,509
<i>Ah. "They lay</i>
<i>with lions."</i>

212
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:40,210
Tavern girls, I'd say.

213
00:14:40,245 --> 00:14:43,280
Probably served
my father's soldiers.

214
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:46,449
Maybe one of them
gave up a kiss and a feel.

215
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:48,984
That's how
they earned this.

216
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:52,888
The glorious work of the
northern freedom fighters.

217
00:14:52,922 --> 00:14:55,157
Must make you proud
to serve the Starks.

218
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:59,162
I don't serve the Starks.
I serve Lady Catelyn.

219
00:14:59,196 --> 00:15:02,098
Tell yourself that tonight
when they swing in your dreams.

220
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,873
- What are you doing?
- Burying them.

221
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:12,344
We shouldn't stay here.
We should get back on the river.

222
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,513
I think these women
would understand if--

223
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,014
I don't care
what you think.

224
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,415
<i>I didn't leave it here.</i>

225
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,551
Untie me now.

226
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,350
<i>I gave it to you to cut</i>
<i>the rope, and now I don't</i>

227
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,753
<i>have me dagger no more.</i>

228
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:25,256
So unless it got stuck in your ass
on its way to your cunt,

229
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:28,258
it stands to reason
that it's gone-- whoa!

230
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,394
What's your business here?

231
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:33,395
Traveling a prisoner.

232
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:39,202
You're a woman.
A woman!

233
00:15:39,237 --> 00:15:41,305
<i>Well, fuck me!</i>

234
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,008
If you've quite
finished up--

235
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,912
All right,
we'll be going.

236
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,582
Whoa, whoa.

237
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,317
Who do you fight for?

238
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,819
The Starks.

239
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:59,023
What did he do?

240
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:02,159
Apparently eating is now a crime.
Who knew?

241
00:16:02,193 --> 00:16:03,594
No, stealing is a crime.

242
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:06,063
But it's not a crime to starve.
That's justice for you.

243
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:08,265
- <i>Where are you taking him?</i>
- To Riverrun.

244
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:10,066
Why Riverrun?

245
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,835
Steal from the Tullys,
it's their dungeons you rot in.

246
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,337
- Why not kill him?
- For stealing a pig?

247
00:16:15,372 --> 00:16:17,373
I don't give the orders.

248
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,941
He must be important
to someone.

249
00:16:18,975 --> 00:16:22,144
Sending him with you?
How important could he be?

250
00:16:23,146 --> 00:16:25,915
All right,
have it your way,

251
00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:27,950
m'lady.

252
00:16:30,688 --> 00:16:34,157
- Do I know you?
- Have you been to Ashemark?

253
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:36,326
- <i>No.</i>
- Then you don't know me.

254
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:39,496
Do you ever go to the river
market at Salt Rock?

255
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:42,066
- Is it near Ashemark?
- <i>No.</i>

256
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,501
I've never been there.

257
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,304
What do you think
of these beauties?

258
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,842
I hope you gave them
quick deaths.

259
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:52,812
Two of them we did, yeah.

260
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:57,216
Wait.

261
00:16:58,953 --> 00:17:01,487
I do know you.

262
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:03,489
That's Jaime Lannister.

263
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:04,967
I wish someone had told me.

264
00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:06,559
I wouldn't have had
to steal that pig.

265
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,895
If this is the Kingslayer,
I think I'd know about it.

266
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,731
How do you know what
the Kingslayer looks like?

267
00:17:10,765 --> 00:17:12,967
I was at Whispering Wood.
I saw him.

268
00:17:13,001 --> 00:17:15,870
<i>They dragged him out of the woods</i>
<i>and threw him down before the King.</i>

269
00:17:15,904 --> 00:17:18,439
He's not the Kingslayer.
Sorry to disappoint you.

270
00:17:18,473 --> 00:17:20,541
If he was, I'd only
be traveling his head.

271
00:17:20,575 --> 00:17:22,710
I have a question
for you both.

272
00:17:22,744 --> 00:17:25,112
And I want you to answer it
at the same time.

273
00:17:25,146 --> 00:17:27,748
<i>I count to three,</i>
<i>you both answer.</i>

274
00:17:27,783 --> 00:17:30,184
What's his name?

275
00:17:30,218 --> 00:17:32,553
One.

276
00:17:32,587 --> 00:17:35,389
<i>Two. Three.</i>

277
00:17:50,271 --> 00:17:52,272
Two quick deaths.

278
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,266
Those were Stark men.

279
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,335
I don't serve the Starks.

280
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,270
I serve Lady Catelyn.

281
00:18:27,304 --> 00:18:29,806
I told her I'd take you
to King's Landing,

282
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,774
and that's what
I'm going to do.

283
00:18:34,044 --> 00:18:35,745
Stay.

284
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:56,402
Walder Frey is a dangerous
man to cross.

285
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:58,037
I know that.

286
00:18:58,071 --> 00:19:00,239
And you mean
to do it anyway?

287
00:19:03,944 --> 00:19:06,146
I love her.

288
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,548
I know that seems
important to you.

289
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:10,516
It is important to me.

290
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,754
Your father didn't love
me when we married.

291
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:19,024
He hardly knew me
or I him.

292
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:24,163
Love didn't just
happen to us.

293
00:19:24,198 --> 00:19:26,834
We built it slowly
over the years,

294
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:28,903
stone by stone,

295
00:19:28,937 --> 00:19:31,306
for you, for your
brothers and sisters,

296
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,908
for all of us.

297
00:19:33,942 --> 00:19:37,978
It's not as exciting as
secret passion in the woods,

298
00:19:38,013 --> 00:19:40,915
but it is stronger.

299
00:19:40,949 --> 00:19:43,818
It lasts longer.

300
00:19:43,853 --> 00:19:46,187
And that is what
would be in store for me

301
00:19:46,221 --> 00:19:48,056
with one of
Walder Frey's daughters,

302
00:19:48,091 --> 00:19:50,826
- what you and father had?
- Why not?

303
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,628
Because she's not beautiful?

304
00:19:52,662 --> 00:19:54,664
Because she's not exotic
and exciting?

305
00:19:54,698 --> 00:19:57,801
Now you're arguing just to argue
because you arranged it.

306
00:19:57,835 --> 00:20:00,671
And you agreed to it.

307
00:20:00,705 --> 00:20:02,573
You gave him your word.

308
00:20:02,607 --> 00:20:07,479
Treat your oaths recklessly and
your people will do the same.

309
00:20:07,513 --> 00:20:09,314
If your father lived
his life for one thing--

310
00:20:09,348 --> 00:20:11,550
My father is dead.

311
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:13,491
And the only parent
I have left has no right

312
00:20:13,516 --> 00:20:15,227
to call anyone reckless.

313
00:20:35,739 --> 00:20:38,474
You said you saw
my victory in the flames.

314
00:20:38,508 --> 00:20:40,542
<i>I did.</i>

315
00:20:40,577 --> 00:20:43,212
- I still see it.
- The flames lied.

316
00:20:44,281 --> 00:20:47,316
And I'm no better
than a savage

317
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:49,452
trusting in a Fire God.

318
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:54,523
I fought for your God
in Blackwater Bay.

319
00:20:54,557 --> 00:20:57,859
I led my men to the gates
of the Seventh Hell

320
00:20:57,893 --> 00:21:01,062
as their brothers burned
alive, and for what?

321
00:21:01,096 --> 00:21:04,998
Attacked from behind by
Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells.

322
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:07,234
If you see so much in your flames,
why didn't you warn me?

323
00:21:07,268 --> 00:21:09,169
The Lord of Light
only allows me glimpses.

324
00:21:09,203 --> 00:21:11,504
You claimed to speak
for a God.

325
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:13,839
Will you quit the war just
because you've lost a battle?

326
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,775
You talk about war
as if you understand it.

327
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:18,010
<i>I've been fighting</i>
<i>far longer than you.</i>

328
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:21,148
Have you?
Show me how you fight.

329
00:21:25,087 --> 00:21:27,789
Show me.

330
00:21:32,562 --> 00:21:35,097
Where's your God now?

331
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:38,700
Will he save you?

332
00:21:38,734 --> 00:21:41,536
Where is your God?

333
00:21:43,773 --> 00:21:46,041
Inside you.

334
00:21:55,316 --> 00:21:57,451
I murdered my brother.

335
00:22:05,762 --> 00:22:08,297
We murdered him.

336
00:22:08,332 --> 00:22:10,066
Share the weight
with me.

337
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,502
He wasn't your brother.

338
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:19,442
This war
has just begun.

339
00:22:19,477 --> 00:22:21,777
It will last for years.

340
00:22:21,812 --> 00:22:25,181
Thousands will die
at your command.

341
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,953
You will betray
the men serving you.

342
00:22:29,987 --> 00:22:32,822
You will betray
your family.

343
00:22:32,856 --> 00:22:36,425
You will betray everything
you once held dear.

344
00:22:37,861 --> 00:22:40,795
And it will all
be worth it

345
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,899
because you are
the Son of Fire.

346
00:22:43,934 --> 00:22:47,136
You are the Warrior
of Light.

347
00:22:49,005 --> 00:22:52,874
You will sweep aside
this pretender and that one.

348
00:22:54,076 --> 00:22:56,511
You will be King.

349
00:22:59,315 --> 00:23:03,051
You promise
these things, but...

350
00:23:03,086 --> 00:23:05,386
you don't know.

351
00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:08,490
None of us know.

352
00:23:08,525 --> 00:23:10,659
Let me show you.

353
00:23:19,836 --> 00:23:21,736
Look into the fire,
my King.

354
00:23:21,771 --> 00:23:24,105
Look.

355
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,973
I see fire.

356
00:23:27,008 --> 00:23:29,142
Keep looking.

357
00:23:36,217 --> 00:23:38,418
Do you see?

358
00:23:38,453 --> 00:23:41,221
Do you see, my King?

359
00:24:00,174 --> 00:24:02,275
Yes.

360
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,789
I will kill that man.

361
00:24:15,823 --> 00:24:18,459
I don't care how many arrows
they feather me with,

362
00:24:18,493 --> 00:24:20,861
how many spears
they run through me,

363
00:24:20,896 --> 00:24:23,931
I will kill that horn-blowing
cunt before I fall.

364
00:24:23,966 --> 00:24:26,768
They want you to know
you're surrounded.

365
00:24:26,802 --> 00:24:28,803
I know I'm surrounded.

366
00:24:28,838 --> 00:24:31,606
I know that because I stood
on the battlements

367
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:33,542
and saw I was surrounded.

368
00:24:33,576 --> 00:24:35,310
<i>They don't want</i>
<i>you to sleep.</i>

369
00:24:35,344 --> 00:24:37,246
They want to sap
your spirit before--

370
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,749
Thank you, wise bald man.

371
00:24:40,783 --> 00:24:44,118
Thank you for explaining
siege tactics to me.

372
00:24:47,522 --> 00:24:49,790
No word from my father?

373
00:24:51,626 --> 00:24:53,326
No.

374
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,729
Send more ravens.

375
00:24:57,199 --> 00:25:00,001
You killed
all the ravens.

376
00:25:02,605 --> 00:25:05,274
The first time
I saw Winterfell...

377
00:25:10,748 --> 00:25:14,251
The first time
I saw Winterfell,

378
00:25:14,285 --> 00:25:16,196
it looked like something
that had been here for

379
00:25:16,221 --> 00:25:18,221
thousands of years

380
00:25:18,723 --> 00:25:20,857
and would be here
for thousands of years

381
00:25:20,891 --> 00:25:23,125
after I was dead.

382
00:25:24,561 --> 00:25:27,662
I saw it
and I thought,

383
00:25:27,696 --> 00:25:30,331
"of course Ned Stark
crushed our rebellion

384
00:25:30,366 --> 00:25:33,101
and killed my brothers.

385
00:25:33,135 --> 00:25:35,670
We never stood a chance against
a man who lives here."

386
00:25:35,704 --> 00:25:38,407
Lord Stark went out of his way
to make it your home.

387
00:25:38,441 --> 00:25:40,943
Yes, my captors were
so very kind to me.

388
00:25:40,977 --> 00:25:43,345
You love
reminding me of that.

389
00:25:44,548 --> 00:25:47,116
Everyone in this
frozen pile of shit

390
00:25:47,151 --> 00:25:49,686
has always loved
reminding me of that.

391
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,559
You know what it's like
to be told how lucky you are

392
00:25:54,593 --> 00:25:56,594
to be someone's prisoner?

393
00:25:58,597 --> 00:26:01,399
To be told how much
you owe them?

394
00:26:03,835 --> 00:26:07,037
And then to go back home
to your real father...

395
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:12,710
I will kill that man.

396
00:26:12,744 --> 00:26:14,211
I swear it to
the Drowned God,

397
00:26:14,246 --> 00:26:15,746
the Old Gods,
the New Gods,

398
00:26:15,781 --> 00:26:17,952
to every fucking God
in every fucking heaven,

399
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:19,850
I will kill that man.

400
00:26:19,851 --> 00:26:22,654
Theon, listen to me.

401
00:26:22,688 --> 00:26:24,856
I serve Winterfell.

402
00:26:24,891 --> 00:26:27,893
Now Winterfell is yours.

403
00:26:27,927 --> 00:26:30,429
I'm bound by oath
to serve you.

404
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:33,232
And what's your counsel,
trusted friend?

405
00:26:33,267 --> 00:26:35,535
Run.

406
00:26:35,569 --> 00:26:38,097
500 Northmen wait
outside the walls.

407
00:26:38,122 --> 00:26:39,972
You have 20 men.

408
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,907
You can't win.

409
00:26:41,942 --> 00:26:44,109
Wait for nightfall
and run.

410
00:26:44,143 --> 00:26:46,611
There's nowhere to run.

411
00:26:46,645 --> 00:26:48,613
I'd never make it back
to the Iron Islands.

412
00:26:48,647 --> 00:26:51,349
And even if I did,
even if by some miracle

413
00:26:51,383 --> 00:26:54,218
I slipped through the lines
and made it home,

414
00:26:54,252 --> 00:26:56,554
I'd be a coward.

415
00:26:56,589 --> 00:26:59,324
The Greyjoy who ran.

416
00:27:00,726 --> 00:27:03,194
The shame of the family.

417
00:27:04,863 --> 00:27:06,631
Don't go home.

418
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:10,501
<i>Join the Night's Watch.</i>

419
00:27:12,437 --> 00:27:14,605
Once a man
has taken the Black...

420
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,677
he's beyond reach
of the law.

421
00:27:19,711 --> 00:27:22,813
All his past crimes
are forgiven.

422
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,884
I won't make it
to the Wall.

423
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:30,221
I won't make it 10 feet
past the Winterfell gates.

424
00:27:30,255 --> 00:27:32,423
There are ways.

425
00:27:32,457 --> 00:27:35,292
Hidden passageways built
so the Lords of Winterfell

426
00:27:35,326 --> 00:27:37,695
could escape.

427
00:27:37,729 --> 00:27:40,397
The road will be dangerous.

428
00:27:42,334 --> 00:27:44,602
But with a little luck...

429
00:27:47,606 --> 00:27:52,176
the Night's Watch is an ancient,
honorable order.

430
00:27:53,545 --> 00:27:55,880
You'll have
opportunities there.

431
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:01,686
The opportunity for Jon Snow
to cut my throat in my sleep.

432
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,757
The opportunity to make
amends for what you've done.

433
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,262
I've done a lot,
haven't I?

434
00:28:11,463 --> 00:28:14,165
Things I never
imagined myself doing.

435
00:28:16,401 --> 00:28:20,471
I've known you many years,
Theon Greyjoy.

436
00:28:22,307 --> 00:28:26,211
You're not the man
you're pretending to be.

437
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,981
Not yet.

438
00:28:33,418 --> 00:28:35,586
You may be right.

439
00:28:37,956 --> 00:28:41,325
But I've gone too far
to pretend to be anything else.

440
00:28:50,903 --> 00:28:53,871
You hear that?

441
00:28:53,905 --> 00:28:57,040
That's the mating call
of the Northmen.

442
00:28:57,074 --> 00:28:59,943
They want to fuck us.

443
00:28:59,977 --> 00:29:02,178
Well, I haven't had
a good fuck in weeks.

444
00:29:02,213 --> 00:29:04,814
I'm ready for one.

445
00:29:04,848 --> 00:29:08,452
They say every Ironborn man is
worth a dozen from the mainland.

446
00:29:08,486 --> 00:29:10,353
Aye!

447
00:29:10,388 --> 00:29:14,391
- You think they're right?
- Aye.

448
00:29:14,425 --> 00:29:18,228
We die today, brothers.

449
00:29:18,262 --> 00:29:21,397
We die bleeding
from 100 wounds

450
00:29:21,432 --> 00:29:26,235
with arrows in our necks
and spears in our guts,

451
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:30,106
but our war cries will echo
through eternity.

452
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,109
They will sing about
the battle of Winterfell

453
00:29:33,143 --> 00:29:36,045
until the Iron Islands have
slipped beneath the waves.

454
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:40,049
Every man, woman, and child
will know who we were

455
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:42,818
and how long we stood.

456
00:29:42,853 --> 00:29:44,687
Aggar and Gelmarr;

457
00:29:44,721 --> 00:29:46,222
Wex and Urzen;

458
00:29:46,256 --> 00:29:48,357
Stygg and Black Lorren--

459
00:29:48,392 --> 00:29:51,660
Ironborn warriors
will cry out our names

460
00:29:51,695 --> 00:29:54,997
as they leap onto the shores
of Seagard and Faircastle.

461
00:29:55,031 --> 00:29:56,465
Aye!

462
00:29:56,499 --> 00:29:59,134
- Mothers will name their sons for us.
- Aye!

463
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,836
Girls will think of us
with their lovers inside them.

464
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:03,404
Aye!

465
00:30:03,439 --> 00:30:05,507
And whoever kills
that fucking horn-blower

466
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:08,610
will stand in bronze
above the shores of Pyke!

467
00:30:08,644 --> 00:30:10,144
Aye!

468
00:30:10,178 --> 00:30:13,013
- What is dead may never die!
- What is dead may never die!

469
00:30:13,048 --> 00:30:15,482
Ah!

470
00:30:18,052 --> 00:30:19,787
Thought he'd never shut up.

471
00:30:19,821 --> 00:30:22,222
It was a good speech.

472
00:30:22,257 --> 00:30:23,957
Didn't want to interrupt.

473
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:29,229
What is this?

474
00:30:29,263 --> 00:30:31,064
What are you doing?

475
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:39,072
Let's go home.

476
00:30:41,209 --> 00:30:43,411
<i>Come on.</i>

477
00:30:52,221 --> 00:30:53,689
<i>Why should I believe you?</i>

478
00:30:53,723 --> 00:30:55,290
Why would I lie
about it?

479
00:30:55,324 --> 00:30:58,059
To create strife between
my sister and me.

480
00:30:58,094 --> 00:31:00,863
Where before there was
nothing but love.

481
00:31:00,897 --> 00:31:05,333
Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill
you on your sister's orders.

482
00:31:05,368 --> 00:31:07,869
If it weren't for your
Squire's bravery,

483
00:31:07,903 --> 00:31:10,538
you'd be a dead man.

484
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:14,308
- <i>Pod.</i>
- Yes, My Lord?

485
00:31:14,343 --> 00:31:16,979
Would it be
excessive of me

486
00:31:17,013 --> 00:31:19,682
to ask you to save
my life twice in a week?

487
00:31:19,716 --> 00:31:21,951
No, My Lord.

488
00:31:21,985 --> 00:31:24,454
<i>You're a good lad.</i>

489
00:31:24,488 --> 00:31:27,290
Get Bronn, tell him I want
four of his most loyal

490
00:31:27,325 --> 00:31:29,260
Gold Cloaks outside
my door at all times.

491
00:31:29,294 --> 00:31:31,629
I'm afraid your friend
has been relieved

492
00:31:31,663 --> 00:31:33,898
of his command
of the City Watch.

493
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:37,602
The Gold Cloaks are now firmly
in the hands of your father

494
00:31:37,636 --> 00:31:39,370
or your sister.

495
00:31:39,404 --> 00:31:42,207
It varies
from cloak to cloak.

496
00:31:42,241 --> 00:31:45,210
- Then my hill tribesmen.
- Have gone home.

497
00:31:45,244 --> 00:31:48,480
Your father paid them
quite handsomely.

498
00:31:51,517 --> 00:31:54,453
I'm afraid we won't
be seeing each other

499
00:31:54,487 --> 00:31:56,555
for some time, My Lord.

500
00:31:56,589 --> 00:32:00,326
Don't want to swim too close
to a drowning man?

501
00:32:01,394 --> 00:32:03,595
And I thought
we were friends.

502
00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:06,565
We are.

503
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:08,533
Podrick, would you mind?

504
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:26,417
There are many who know
that without you

505
00:32:26,451 --> 00:32:30,088
this city faced
certain defeat.

506
00:32:30,122 --> 00:32:32,290
<i>The King won't give</i>
<i>you any honors,</i>

507
00:32:32,324 --> 00:32:34,826
<i>the histories</i>
<i>won't mention you,</i>

508
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:38,062
but we will not forget.

509
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:42,133
Come along now, Podrick.

510
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,675
My love.

511
00:32:48,709 --> 00:32:50,309
It was good of you
to come.

512
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:51,945
Good of me?

513
00:32:51,979 --> 00:32:54,014
Of course I come.

514
00:32:58,052 --> 00:33:00,720
- I want to see you.
- Believe me, you don't.

515
00:33:01,822 --> 00:33:03,690
Have you looked?

516
00:33:04,892 --> 00:33:06,625
I will be the first.

517
00:33:30,686 --> 00:33:32,353
Well?

518
00:33:32,388 --> 00:33:35,357
You are a mess.

519
00:33:37,093 --> 00:33:39,761
I'm a monster
as well as a dwarf.

520
00:33:39,795 --> 00:33:41,296
You should charge
me double.

521
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,064
You think I'm here
for money?

522
00:33:43,098 --> 00:33:45,033
That was the arrangement
we made.

523
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:48,102
I pay you
and you lie to me.

524
00:33:48,136 --> 00:33:50,671
Aw, I'm a poor
little rich man

525
00:33:50,706 --> 00:33:52,646
and nobody loves me,
so I make jokes all the time

526
00:33:52,671 --> 00:33:54,225
and pay them to laugh.

527
00:33:54,776 --> 00:33:56,543
Fuck your money.

528
00:33:57,512 --> 00:33:58,612
Let's leave.

529
00:33:58,647 --> 00:34:00,614
- Leave?
- Leave King's Landing.

530
00:34:00,649 --> 00:34:03,184
They tried to kill you.
They will try again.

531
00:34:03,218 --> 00:34:05,453
Going into wars,
fighting soldiers--

532
00:34:05,488 --> 00:34:07,089
you're terrible at this.

533
00:34:08,691 --> 00:34:11,260
Let's take a boat to Pentos
and never come back.

534
00:34:11,294 --> 00:34:12,895
You don't belong here.

535
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,698
What would we do
in Pentos?

536
00:34:14,732 --> 00:34:17,467
Eat, drink,

537
00:34:17,502 --> 00:34:19,769
fuck, live.

538
00:34:23,842 --> 00:34:26,077
I want to go with you.

539
00:34:26,111 --> 00:34:27,678
So do it.

540
00:34:27,713 --> 00:34:29,947
Your father, your sister,
all these bad people,

541
00:34:29,982 --> 00:34:31,749
they can't stop you.

542
00:34:31,784 --> 00:34:34,218
Forget about them.
Come with me.

543
00:34:36,722 --> 00:34:38,422
I can't.

544
00:34:38,457 --> 00:34:41,291
I do belong here.

545
00:34:42,227 --> 00:34:44,462
These bad people

546
00:34:44,496 --> 00:34:46,130
are what I'm good at.

547
00:34:46,164 --> 00:34:48,566
Outtalking them,
outthinking them.

548
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,902
It's what I am.

549
00:34:52,304 --> 00:34:55,140
And I like it.

550
00:34:55,174 --> 00:34:58,576
I like it more than
anything I've ever done.

551
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:05,517
Are you going to leave?

552
00:35:11,457 --> 00:35:13,625
You have a shit memory.

553
00:35:16,195 --> 00:35:18,696
I am yours
and you are mine.

554
00:35:30,942 --> 00:35:33,544
In the sight
of the Seven,

555
00:35:33,578 --> 00:35:37,615
I hereby seal
these two souls,

556
00:35:37,649 --> 00:35:42,420
binding them as one
for eternity.

557
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:50,594
Look upon one another
and say the words.

558
00:35:54,198 --> 00:35:56,232
Father, smith,

559
00:35:56,266 --> 00:35:58,233
warrior, mother,

560
00:35:58,268 --> 00:36:01,804
maiden, crone,
stranger...

561
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:04,540
- I am hers and she is mine...
- I am his and he is mine...

562
00:36:04,574 --> 00:36:08,077
from this day
until the end of my days.

563
00:37:16,684 --> 00:37:18,885
Is this a riddle?

564
00:37:58,725 --> 00:38:01,193
Khaleesi!

565
00:38:02,162 --> 00:38:04,029
Khaleesi!

566
00:38:06,633 --> 00:38:09,001
<i>Khaleesi!</i>

567
00:38:11,771 --> 00:38:14,906
Are you trying to frighten me
with magic tricks?

568
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,642
You want me?
Here I am.

569
00:38:17,677 --> 00:38:19,745
Are you afraid
of a little girl?

570
00:38:44,203 --> 00:38:46,504
<i>How did he find us?</i>

571
00:39:10,563 --> 00:39:12,564
What are you doing here?

572
00:39:12,598 --> 00:39:14,266
Waiting for you.

573
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,969
How did you know
we'd come this way?

574
00:39:17,003 --> 00:39:18,871
After all the things
you have seen,

575
00:39:18,905 --> 00:39:20,906
this is your question?

576
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,576
How did you
kill those guards?

577
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,978
Was it hard?

578
00:39:26,012 --> 00:39:28,747
No harder than taking a new name
if you know the way.

579
00:39:28,782 --> 00:39:32,418
Show me how. I want
to be able to do it, too.

580
00:39:32,452 --> 00:39:34,620
If you would learn,
you must come with me.

581
00:39:34,655 --> 00:39:36,221
Where?

582
00:39:36,256 --> 00:39:39,458
Far and away across
the Narrow Sea to Braavos.

583
00:39:39,492 --> 00:39:41,560
My dancing master
was from Braavos.

584
00:39:43,062 --> 00:39:44,830
To be a dancing master
is a special thing,

585
00:39:44,865 --> 00:39:47,466
but to be a faceless man--

586
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,435
that is something
else entirely.

587
00:39:49,469 --> 00:39:52,672
A girl has many names
on her lips--

588
00:39:52,706 --> 00:39:55,975
Joffrey, Cersei,
Tywin Lannister,

589
00:39:56,009 --> 00:39:57,843
Ilyn Payne, the Hound.

590
00:39:57,878 --> 00:40:01,314
Names to offer up
to the Red God.

591
00:40:01,348 --> 00:40:05,150
She could offer them all
one by one.

592
00:40:07,287 --> 00:40:09,421
I want to.

593
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,358
But I can't.

594
00:40:14,393 --> 00:40:17,495
I need to find
my brother and mother.

595
00:40:18,397 --> 00:40:20,131
And my sister.

596
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,801
I need to find
her, too.

597
00:40:25,371 --> 00:40:27,271
Then we must part.

598
00:40:27,306 --> 00:40:29,507
A man has duties as well.

599
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:30,976
Here.

600
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,977
What is it?

601
00:40:33,012 --> 00:40:36,014
A coin of great value.

602
00:40:36,048 --> 00:40:38,483
Could it buy a horse?

603
00:40:38,518 --> 00:40:41,453
It is not meant
for the buying of horses.

604
00:40:41,487 --> 00:40:42,988
Then what good is it?

605
00:40:43,022 --> 00:40:45,857
If the day comes when
you must find me again,

606
00:40:45,892 --> 00:40:47,960
just give that coin
to any man from Braavos

607
00:40:47,994 --> 00:40:49,728
and say these words to him,

608
00:40:49,762 --> 00:40:51,764
"Valar Morghulis."

609
00:40:51,798 --> 00:40:54,333
Valar Morghulis.

610
00:40:58,105 --> 00:41:00,305
Please don't go, Jaqen.

611
00:41:03,476 --> 00:41:05,678
Jaqen is dead.

612
00:41:05,712 --> 00:41:08,681
Say it again.
Valar Morghulis.

613
00:41:08,715 --> 00:41:12,018
Valar Morghulis.

614
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:14,020
Good.

615
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:23,229
Farewell, Arya Stark.

616
00:41:47,388 --> 00:41:50,490
Osha, what are you doing?

617
00:43:13,973 --> 00:43:16,642
Tell us what medicine
to get from your chambers.

618
00:43:16,676 --> 00:43:19,412
- We'll make you better.
- I feel just fine.

619
00:43:22,783 --> 00:43:26,252
They burned it down.
They burned everything.

620
00:43:26,287 --> 00:43:29,856
Not everything.
Not you.

621
00:43:32,493 --> 00:43:34,594
But they may come back.
You have to go.

622
00:43:34,628 --> 00:43:36,496
Put on your
warmest clothes.

623
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,965
Pack as much food as you
can carry and go north.

624
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,834
North's the wrong way.

625
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,969
Their mother and brother
are south.

626
00:43:43,003 --> 00:43:44,804
We don't know where.

627
00:43:44,838 --> 00:43:47,640
There are too many enemies
in the South.

628
00:43:47,675 --> 00:43:49,643
Go to the Wall
to Jon.

629
00:43:49,677 --> 00:43:52,545
<i>He'll look after you and let your</i>
<i>mother know you're safe.</i>

630
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:55,516
I don't want to leave you.

631
00:43:55,551 --> 00:43:58,286
No more than I want
to leave you.

632
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:02,023
I pulled you
into the world.

633
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:03,591
Both of you.

634
00:44:03,626 --> 00:44:07,063
I've seen both your faces
almost every day since.

635
00:44:07,097 --> 00:44:12,268
And for that, I consider
myself very, very lucky.

636
00:44:13,638 --> 00:44:15,104
Go now with Hodor.

637
00:44:15,139 --> 00:44:17,206
<i>Go on.</i>

638
00:44:17,241 --> 00:44:19,342
I'll be right here.

639
00:44:21,445 --> 00:44:23,579
Hodor.

640
00:44:26,182 --> 00:44:28,817
Osha.

641
00:44:28,852 --> 00:44:30,852
You must protect them.

642
00:44:30,887 --> 00:44:33,588
You're the only one
who can.

643
00:44:35,658 --> 00:44:38,993
You may have to protect
them against your own kind.

644
00:44:39,027 --> 00:44:41,896
I've got no great love
for my own kind.

645
00:44:44,399 --> 00:44:46,833
I'll get you milk
of the poppy.

646
00:44:46,868 --> 00:44:48,702
Tell me where to find it.

647
00:44:48,736 --> 00:44:51,437
I don't want
milk of the poppy.

648
00:45:01,716 --> 00:45:03,383
Do it quickly.

649
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:58,240
Until the sun
rises in the west

650
00:50:58,274 --> 00:51:01,843
and sets in the east,

651
00:51:01,877 --> 00:51:04,579
until the rivers run dry

652
00:51:04,613 --> 00:51:07,782
and the mountains blow
in the wind like leaves.

653
00:51:49,558 --> 00:51:52,426
They miss their mother.

654
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,861
They want to be with you.

655
00:51:54,896 --> 00:51:56,663
Do you want
to be with them?

656
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:58,498
You will be.

657
00:51:58,533 --> 00:52:00,901
<i>When your dragons</i>
<i>were born,</i>

658
00:52:00,936 --> 00:52:02,937
our magic
was born again.

659
00:52:02,971 --> 00:52:04,906
It is strongest
in their presence.

660
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:08,843
And they are strongest
in yours.

661
00:52:08,878 --> 00:52:11,913
You will be with them,

662
00:52:11,948 --> 00:52:14,883
through winter, summer,

663
00:52:14,918 --> 00:52:17,219
and winter again.

664
00:52:17,253 --> 00:52:20,088
Across a thousand
thousand seasons

665
00:52:20,123 --> 00:52:21,923
you will be with them.

666
00:52:21,957 --> 00:52:25,159
And we will be with you
until time comes to an end.

667
00:52:30,932 --> 00:52:34,401
Welcome home,
Daenerys Stormborn.

668
00:52:34,435 --> 00:52:36,536
This is not my home.

669
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,611
My home is across the sea

670
00:52:37,636 --> 00:52:39,716
where my people
are waiting for me.

671
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,476
They will be waiting
a long time.

672
00:52:59,929 --> 00:53:02,063
Dracarys.

673
00:53:49,913 --> 00:53:52,414
We should be there
by sundown.

674
00:53:52,449 --> 00:53:54,149
Won't be a fun
night for you.

675
00:53:54,183 --> 00:53:57,152
Mance knows how
to make crows sing.

676
00:53:59,489 --> 00:54:01,197
If you know what to say,
you might just make it

677
00:54:01,222 --> 00:54:02,833
through the night.

678
00:54:05,428 --> 00:54:08,497
Not talking's
not the way to go.

679
00:54:08,531 --> 00:54:11,366
Careful with that.

680
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,668
You might cut yourself.

681
00:54:13,703 --> 00:54:16,438
Never swung a sword
before, have you?

682
00:54:16,472 --> 00:54:18,240
You look like a baby
with a rattle.

683
00:54:18,274 --> 00:54:20,608
<i>Enough of that!</i>

684
00:54:30,186 --> 00:54:32,220
- Stop!
- Why, traitor?

685
00:54:32,254 --> 00:54:36,057
So you can give Mance Rayder
an invitation to Castle Black?

686
00:54:36,091 --> 00:54:38,292
Let 'em fight.

687
00:54:57,779 --> 00:55:00,214
That's it?
That's what you can do?

688
00:55:00,248 --> 00:55:02,316
You little shit.

689
00:55:07,223 --> 00:55:09,457
Your traitor father
teach you that?

690
00:55:12,962 --> 00:55:15,063
Or was it your whore mother?

691
00:55:33,416 --> 00:55:37,218
We are the Watchers
on the Wall.

692
00:55:49,834 --> 00:55:51,736
You can tell Mance

693
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:55,540
that's the man who killed
Qhorin Halfhand.

694
00:56:09,555 --> 00:56:11,890
- Burn the body.
<i>- Aye.</i>

695
00:56:11,924 --> 00:56:14,259
You don't want this one
coming back for you.

696
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,241
Come along, Jon Snow.

697
00:56:55,901 --> 00:56:58,936
Time to meet
the King-Beyond-The-Wall.

698
00:57:45,019 --> 00:57:47,153
What the--?

699
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:55,327
<i>Khaleesi, please.</i>

700
00:57:55,362 --> 00:57:57,263
He said you'd never
leave Qarth alive.

701
00:57:57,297 --> 00:57:59,498
Come.

702
00:58:30,164 --> 00:58:31,998
Nothing.

703
00:58:39,239 --> 00:58:42,575
Thank you,
Xaro Xhoan Daxos.

704
00:58:42,609 --> 00:58:45,745
<i>Thank you for teaching</i>
<i>me this lesson.</i>

705
00:58:48,482 --> 00:58:50,016
I am King of Qarth.

706
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:52,018
I can help you now,
truly help you.

707
00:58:52,052 --> 00:58:54,153
We can take
the Iron Throne.

708
00:58:54,188 --> 00:58:56,389
- I'll bring you 1,000 ships.
- Please, Khaleesi, I beg you.

709
00:58:56,423 --> 00:58:58,891
All that you have dreamed
is within your reach!

710
00:58:58,926 --> 00:59:01,694
I beg you, please!

711
00:59:01,729 --> 00:59:04,597
- Khaleesi.
- Please! Please!

712
00:59:04,631 --> 00:59:07,834
<i>- Khaleesi!</i>

713
00:59:26,153 --> 00:59:28,922
It's all a lie.

714
00:59:28,956 --> 00:59:31,258
Looks real enough to me.

715
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,764
Real enough
to buy a ship?

716
00:59:39,133 --> 00:59:42,035
Aye, a small ship.

717
01:00:25,979 --> 01:00:29,115
I thought we were coming
north to fight wildlings.

718
01:00:32,186 --> 01:00:34,553
Is this goat?

719
01:00:34,588 --> 01:00:36,122
It's moose.

720
01:00:36,156 --> 01:00:38,257
People shouldn't
live anywhere

721
01:00:38,291 --> 01:00:40,326
you need to burn shit
to keep warm.

722
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:44,497
Well, you see a tree,
let me know.

723
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,567
If you step back
and think about it,

724
01:00:48,602 --> 01:00:50,970
the thing about Gilly
that's so interesting is--

725
01:00:51,004 --> 01:00:53,272
- Just bloody kill me.
- No, truly.

726
01:00:53,307 --> 01:00:56,509
The thing about her that
I find so interesting is that

727
01:00:56,543 --> 01:00:59,078
after all that
Craster's done to her,

728
01:00:59,112 --> 01:01:01,614
she's still got hope that
life might get better.

729
01:01:01,648 --> 01:01:04,883
The thing about Gilly
that you find so interesting

730
01:01:04,917 --> 01:01:07,686
is that she said
six words to you.

731
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:10,855
And the thing about you
that I find so interesting

732
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:12,857
is absolutely nothing.

733
01:01:15,694 --> 01:01:17,828
It's Jon
and the Halfhand.

734
01:01:17,862 --> 01:01:20,697
They're back.

735
01:01:23,134 --> 01:01:26,003
Two blasts is wildlings.

736
01:01:26,037 --> 01:01:28,071
You're not fighting them alone.
Come on.

737
01:01:33,078 --> 01:01:34,979
Three blasts?

738
01:01:35,013 --> 01:01:37,114
Run!

739
01:01:42,821 --> 01:01:45,523
Wait! Wait for me!

740
01:01:48,928 --> 01:01:50,362
Grenn!

741
01:01:51,597 --> 01:01:53,765
<i>Edd!</i>
