3
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:59,124
Yah!
Left high, left low.

4
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,778
Right low,
lunge right.

5
00:02:21,948 --> 00:02:24,649
You break anything,
the Septa will have my head.

6
00:02:24,683 --> 00:02:26,484
What is--

7
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:40,329
Your sister knew perfectly
well we were to leave today.

8
00:02:40,363 --> 00:02:42,531
- How she could forget--
- She didn't forget.

9
00:02:42,565 --> 00:02:45,267
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.

10
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:47,837
She always comes back with scrapes
and bruises. She's so clumsy.

11
00:02:47,871 --> 00:02:49,772
Hush!

12
00:02:49,807 --> 00:02:52,008
Go back to your room.

13
00:02:52,943 --> 00:02:54,345
Bar the doors

14
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:56,580
and do not open them for anyone
you do not know.

15
00:02:56,615 --> 00:02:59,283
- What is it? What's happening?
- Do as I told you.

16
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:01,119
Run!

17
00:03:04,857 --> 00:03:06,524
<i>This way!</i>

18
00:03:20,036 --> 00:03:22,204
Left, right.
Rah!

19
00:03:22,238 --> 00:03:23,939
Now you are dead.

20
00:03:23,973 --> 00:03:25,941
You said right,

21
00:03:25,975 --> 00:03:27,843
but you went left.

22
00:03:27,877 --> 00:03:30,078
And now you are
a dead girl.

23
00:03:30,112 --> 00:03:31,713
Only 'cause you lied.

24
00:03:31,748 --> 00:03:34,382
My tongue lied.
My eyes

25
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:37,619
shouted the truth.
You were not seeing.

26
00:03:37,653 --> 00:03:40,155
I was so.
I watched, but you--

27
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:43,659
watching is not seeing,
dead girl.

28
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:49,365
The seeing,
the true seeing,

29
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:51,835
that is the heart
of swordplay.

30
00:03:56,341 --> 00:03:58,843
Arya Stark,
come with us.

31
00:03:58,877 --> 00:04:01,613
Your father wants
to see you.

32
00:04:01,647 --> 00:04:04,015
And why is it

33
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:06,484
that Lord Eddard is
sending Lannister men

34
00:04:06,518 --> 00:04:08,720
in place of his own?
I am wondering.

35
00:04:08,754 --> 00:04:11,823
Mind your place,
dancing master.

36
00:04:11,857 --> 00:04:14,392
<i>This is no</i>
<i>concern of yours.</i>

37
00:04:14,426 --> 00:04:16,261
My father wouldn't
send you.

38
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,500
And I don't have to go
with you if I don't want.

39
00:04:22,534 --> 00:04:24,869
Take her.

40
00:04:24,903 --> 00:04:28,873
Are you men or snakes, that you
would threaten a child?

41
00:04:28,907 --> 00:04:31,042
Get out of my way,
little man.

42
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:34,545
<i>I</i> am Syrio Forel...

43
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:36,580
Foreign bastard.

44
00:04:39,317 --> 00:04:43,020
...And you will be speaking
to me with more respect.

45
00:04:43,054 --> 00:04:45,656
Kill the Braavosi.
Bring the girl.

46
00:04:47,193 --> 00:04:49,928
Arya child, we are done
with dancing for the day.

47
00:04:49,962 --> 00:04:52,597
Run to your father.

48
00:05:13,086 --> 00:05:15,821
Bloody oafs.

49
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:17,723
Be gone now, Arya.

50
00:05:17,758 --> 00:05:20,327
Come with me.
Run.

51
00:05:21,963 --> 00:05:24,965
The first sword of Braavos
does not run.

52
00:05:37,111 --> 00:05:39,012
What do we say

53
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,981
to the God of death?

54
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:42,883
Not today.

55
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:45,852
Go.

56
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,512
Not today.
Not today.

57
00:06:23,056 --> 00:06:24,857
Stay away from me.

58
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:26,558
I'll tell my father.

59
00:06:26,593 --> 00:06:29,561
I'll-- I'll tell
the Queen.

60
00:06:29,595 --> 00:06:33,298
Who do you think sent me?

61
00:06:45,811 --> 00:06:47,679
Needle.

62
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:52,951
There she is.

63
00:06:52,986 --> 00:06:55,253
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.

64
00:06:55,288 --> 00:06:56,989
- Come here.
- Leave me be.

65
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,090
My father's a lord.
He'll reward you.

66
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,692
<i>She'll</i> reward me--
the Queen!

67
00:07:00,726 --> 00:07:02,894
Stay away!

68
00:07:31,992 --> 00:07:35,628
Lord Stark,
you must be thirsty.

69
00:07:37,064 --> 00:07:39,232
Varys.

70
00:07:41,035 --> 00:07:43,336
I promise you
it isn't poisoned.

71
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,308
Why is it no one ever
trusts the eunuch?

72
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,619
Not so much, My Lord.

73
00:07:57,654 --> 00:07:59,688
I would save the rest,
if I were you.

74
00:07:59,722 --> 00:08:03,592
Hide it. Men have been known to die
of thirst in these cells.

75
00:08:05,462 --> 00:08:07,964
What about
my daughters?

76
00:08:07,998 --> 00:08:10,533
The younger one seems
to have escaped the castle.

77
00:08:10,568 --> 00:08:12,769
Even my little birds
cannot find her.

78
00:08:12,803 --> 00:08:16,339
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.

79
00:08:16,373 --> 00:08:19,943
Cersei will keep her close. The rest
of your household though--

80
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:22,145
all dead,
it grieves me to say.

81
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:24,447
I do so hate
the sight of blood.

82
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:28,818
You watched my men being
slaughtered and did nothing.

83
00:08:28,852 --> 00:08:31,154
And would again, My Lord.

84
00:08:31,188 --> 00:08:35,591
I was unarmed, unarmored and
surrounded by Lannister swords.

85
00:08:35,626 --> 00:08:37,960
When you look at me
do you see a hero?

86
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,268
What madness led you
to tell the Queen

87
00:08:46,303 --> 00:08:49,105
you had learned the truth
about Joffrey's birth?

88
00:08:51,475 --> 00:08:53,442
The madness of mercy.

89
00:08:55,145 --> 00:08:57,880
That she might
save her children.

90
00:08:57,915 --> 00:08:59,748
<i>Ah, the children.</i>

91
00:08:59,783 --> 00:09:02,652
It is always
the innocents who suffer.

92
00:09:02,686 --> 00:09:05,587
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert,
nor the boar.

93
00:09:05,622 --> 00:09:09,091
The wine slowed him down
and the boar ripped him open,

94
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,360
but it was your mercy
that killed the King.

95
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:19,300
I trust you know you are
a dead man, Lord Eddard?

96
00:09:24,038 --> 00:09:26,606
The Queen
can't kill me.

97
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:29,109
Cat holds her brother.

98
00:09:29,144 --> 00:09:31,845
The wrong brother
sadly.

99
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,614
And lost to her.

100
00:09:33,648 --> 00:09:36,583
Your wife has let the Imp
slip through her fingers.

101
00:09:40,422 --> 00:09:42,857
If that's true,

102
00:09:42,891 --> 00:09:46,427
then slit my throat
and be done with it.

103
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,030
Not today, My Lord.

104
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:54,903
Tell me something, Varys.

105
00:09:54,938 --> 00:09:57,440
Who do you truly serve?

106
00:09:58,676 --> 00:10:01,344
The Realm, My Lord.

107
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:03,646
Someone must.

108
00:10:22,631 --> 00:10:25,367
It's Othor,
without a doubt.

109
00:10:26,703 --> 00:10:28,303
The other one is
Jafer Flowers, My Lord,

110
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:31,106
<i>less the hand</i>
<i>the wolf tore off.</i>

111
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:34,143
Any sign of Benjen
or the rest of his party?

112
00:10:34,178 --> 00:10:37,046
Just these two,
My Lord.

113
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:39,082
Been dead awhile,
I'd say.

114
00:10:39,117 --> 00:10:41,852
- Mmm.
- The smell.

115
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:46,858
What smell?

116
00:10:46,892 --> 00:10:49,928
There is none.

117
00:10:49,962 --> 00:10:53,698
If they'd be dead for a long time,
wouldn't there be rot?

118
00:10:53,732 --> 00:10:56,434
We should burn them.

119
00:10:56,468 --> 00:10:59,504
Snow's not wrong, My Lord.
Fire will do for them.

120
00:10:59,538 --> 00:11:01,706
The Wildling way.

121
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:04,476
I want Maester Aemon
to examine them first.

122
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,679
You may be
a coward, Tarly,

123
00:11:07,713 --> 00:11:09,848
<i>but you're not stupid.</i>

124
00:11:09,882 --> 00:11:13,918
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.

125
00:11:15,454 --> 00:11:17,422
Lord Commander,

126
00:11:17,456 --> 00:11:19,958
Maester Aemon awaits you
in his chambers--

127
00:11:19,992 --> 00:11:23,828
a raven
from King's Landing.

128
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:25,730
Come on,
move 'em out.

129
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:40,308
Bring me a horn
of ale, Snow,

130
00:11:40,343 --> 00:11:43,278
<i>and pour one</i>
<i>for yourself.</i>

131
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:55,657
The King is dead.

132
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,303
Is there any word
of my father?

133
00:12:10,337 --> 00:12:12,572
Sit.

134
00:12:17,077 --> 00:12:19,611
Lord Stark has been

135
00:12:19,645 --> 00:12:22,247
charged with treason.

136
00:12:22,281 --> 00:12:24,683
They say he conspired
with Robert's brothers

137
00:12:24,717 --> 00:12:27,453
to deny the throne
to Prince Joffrey.

138
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:43,439
<i>I hope you're not thinking</i>
<i>of doing anything stupid.</i>

139
00:12:43,473 --> 00:12:46,909
Your duty lies here now.

140
00:12:46,943 --> 00:12:50,012
My sisters were
in King's Landing too.

141
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:54,450
I'm sure they'll be

142
00:12:54,484 --> 00:12:56,285
treated gently.

143
00:12:59,422 --> 00:13:02,558
Your father has proved to be
an awful traitor, dear.

144
00:13:02,592 --> 00:13:06,062
King Robert's body
was still warm

145
00:13:06,096 --> 00:13:10,366
when Lord Eddard began plotting
to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.

146
00:13:10,401 --> 00:13:12,769
He wouldn't do that.

147
00:13:12,804 --> 00:13:15,672
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.

148
00:13:15,707 --> 00:13:18,809
Please, Your Grace,
there's been a mistake.

149
00:13:18,843 --> 00:13:22,480
Send for my father. He'll tell you--
the King was his friend.

150
00:13:22,514 --> 00:13:25,583
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of
any wrong. We know that.

151
00:13:25,617 --> 00:13:29,119
<i>Yet you are the daughter</i>
<i>of a traitor.</i>

152
00:13:29,153 --> 00:13:31,321
How can I allow you
to marry my son?

153
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:34,524
<i>A child born</i>
<i>of a traitor's seed</i>

154
00:13:34,558 --> 00:13:36,892
is no fit consort
for our King.

155
00:13:36,927 --> 00:13:39,561
<i>She is a sweet thing now,</i>
<i>Your Grace,</i>

156
00:13:39,595 --> 00:13:42,063
but in 10 years who knows

157
00:13:42,097 --> 00:13:44,065
what treasons
she may hatch?

158
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,168
No, I'm not. I'll be a good wife
to him, you'll see.

159
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:51,773
I'll be a Queen just like you,
I promise. I won't hatch anything.

160
00:13:53,276 --> 00:13:55,777
The girl is innocent,
Your Grace.

161
00:13:55,812 --> 00:13:59,614
She should be given a chance
to prove her loyalty.

162
00:14:05,922 --> 00:14:08,824
Little dove, you must
write to Lady Catelyn

163
00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:11,193
and your brother,
the eldest, what's his name?

164
00:14:11,228 --> 00:14:12,962
Robb.

165
00:14:12,996 --> 00:14:15,765
Word of your father's arrest
will reach him soon, no doubt.

166
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,201
Best it comes from you.

167
00:14:18,236 --> 00:14:20,604
If you would help
your father,

168
00:14:20,638 --> 00:14:23,074
urge your brother
to keep the King's peace.

169
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:27,011
Tell him to come to King's Landing
and swear his fealty to Joffrey.

170
00:14:32,283 --> 00:14:36,653
If-- if I could see my father,
talk to him about--

171
00:14:39,256 --> 00:14:42,625
You disappoint me, child.

172
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:44,960
We have told you
of your father's treason.

173
00:14:44,995 --> 00:14:47,162
Why would you want
to speak to a traitor?

174
00:14:47,197 --> 00:14:49,464
I only meant that--

175
00:14:51,668 --> 00:14:53,502
what will happen to him?

176
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:58,906
- That depends.
- On-- on what?

177
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,808
On your brother.

178
00:15:03,845 --> 00:15:06,180
And on you.

179
00:15:13,923 --> 00:15:16,692
Treason?

180
00:15:16,726 --> 00:15:18,861
Sansa wrote this?

181
00:15:18,895 --> 00:15:21,264
It is your sister's hand,
but the Queen's words.

182
00:15:21,298 --> 00:15:25,401
You are summoned to King's Landing
to swear fealty to the new King.

183
00:15:25,436 --> 00:15:28,538
Joffrey puts my father in chains,
now he wants his ass kissed?

184
00:15:28,572 --> 00:15:32,075
This is a royal
command, My Lord.

185
00:15:32,109 --> 00:15:35,578
- If you should refuse to obey--
- I won't refuse.

186
00:15:35,613 --> 00:15:38,381
His Grace summons me
to King's Landing,

187
00:15:38,415 --> 00:15:40,850
I'll go to King's Landing.

188
00:15:40,884 --> 00:15:43,619
But not alone.

189
00:15:45,722 --> 00:15:47,456
Call the banners.

190
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:50,825
All of them, My Lord?

191
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,731
They've all sworn to defend
my father, have they not?

192
00:15:52,756 --> 00:15:53,956
They have.

193
00:15:54,864 --> 00:15:57,132
Now we see what
their words are worth.

194
00:15:59,235 --> 00:16:00,402
Yeah.

195
00:16:08,645 --> 00:16:11,046
Are you afraid?

196
00:16:13,884 --> 00:16:15,584
I must be.

197
00:16:15,619 --> 00:16:17,787
Good.

198
00:16:17,821 --> 00:16:19,855
Why is that good?

199
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,191
It means
you're not stupid.

200
00:16:45,582 --> 00:16:47,483
You've had this
since dawn?

201
00:16:48,518 --> 00:16:51,086
He sent it to me,
not you.

202
00:16:51,121 --> 00:16:53,555
I've only shown it
to you as a courtesy.

203
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,457
A courtesy?!

204
00:16:55,491 --> 00:16:57,493
My husband has been
taken prisoner.

205
00:16:57,527 --> 00:16:59,161
My son intends
to declare war.

206
00:16:59,196 --> 00:17:01,063
A war?

207
00:17:01,097 --> 00:17:03,499
Your son against
the Lannisters?

208
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:07,903
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.

209
00:17:07,937 --> 00:17:11,106
Ned rots in a dungeon
and you speak of patience?

210
00:17:11,141 --> 00:17:13,843
He is your brother by law!

211
00:17:13,877 --> 00:17:16,746
Does family mean
nothing to you?

212
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,649
Family means
everything to me.

213
00:17:19,683 --> 00:17:22,118
And I will not
risk Robin's life

214
00:17:22,152 --> 00:17:24,621
to get caught up in another
of your husband's wars.

215
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:27,557
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.

216
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:29,792
You just ate.

217
00:17:29,827 --> 00:17:32,662
You will not support us then?
Do I understand you correctly?

218
00:17:32,696 --> 00:17:36,532
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.

219
00:17:38,569 --> 00:17:40,870
You're always
welcome here, sister.

220
00:17:40,905 --> 00:17:43,906
But if you're asking me to send men
from the Vale to fight--

221
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:46,142
That is what I ask.

222
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:50,980
Go on, sweet.
Time for your bath.

223
00:17:51,014 --> 00:17:53,616
I'll feed you after.

224
00:17:58,889 --> 00:18:01,291
If you fear for the safety
of your son--

225
00:18:01,325 --> 00:18:03,993
Of course I fear
for the safety of my son!

226
00:18:04,027 --> 00:18:06,529
Are you an idiot?

227
00:18:06,563 --> 00:18:08,965
They killed my husband.

228
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:11,434
<i>You say they shoved</i>
<i>your boy from a window.</i>

229
00:18:11,468 --> 00:18:14,003
These people
will do anything.

230
00:18:14,037 --> 00:18:16,104
And that is why
we have to stop them.

231
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:22,677
The knights of the Vale
will stay in the Vale

232
00:18:22,711 --> 00:18:26,447
where they belong,
to protect their Lord.

233
00:18:39,864 --> 00:18:43,266
Will you shut up?

234
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,404
There's hill tribes
all around here.

235
00:18:47,439 --> 00:18:49,907
If I'm going to die,

236
00:18:49,941 --> 00:18:52,276
it may as well be
with a song in my heart.

237
00:18:52,311 --> 00:18:55,547
I should just take your food
and leave you here.

238
00:18:55,581 --> 00:18:58,850
Eh? What would
you do then?

239
00:18:58,884 --> 00:19:01,720
Starve, most likely.

240
00:19:01,754 --> 00:19:03,588
You don't think
I'd do it, do you?

241
00:19:05,091 --> 00:19:08,126
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold? Women?

242
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:11,063
Golden women?

243
00:19:11,097 --> 00:19:13,299
Stick with me
and you'll have them all,

244
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:16,167
for as long as I'm around
and not for a moment longer.

245
00:19:16,202 --> 00:19:19,470
But you knew that.

246
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:23,073
That is why you so valiantly took
up arms to defend my honor.

247
00:19:24,943 --> 00:19:27,278
Fair enough.

248
00:19:27,313 --> 00:19:29,848
But don't go looking
for me to bend the knee

249
00:19:29,882 --> 00:19:32,451
and "My Lord" you
every time you take a shit.

250
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:35,754
I'm not your toady
and I'm not your friend.

251
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,992
Though I would treasure
your friendship,

252
00:19:39,026 --> 00:19:41,628
I'm mainly interested
in your facility with murder.

253
00:19:41,663 --> 00:19:45,066
And if the day ever comes when
you're tempted to sell me out,

254
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,834
remember this:

255
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:49,737
Whatever their price,
I'll beat it.

256
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,872
I like living.

257
00:19:56,478 --> 00:20:00,314
<i>Tyrion.</i>

258
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:03,150
Tyrion.

259
00:20:07,322 --> 00:20:09,190
Tyrion.

260
00:20:31,013 --> 00:20:33,582
Come, share our fire.

261
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:36,384
Help yourselves
to our goat.

262
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,659
When you meet your Gods,
you tell them

263
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:47,628
Shagga Son of Dolf

264
00:20:47,662 --> 00:20:51,031
of the Stone Crows
sent you.

265
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:54,469
I am Tyrion son of Tywin
of Clan Lannister.

266
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,538
How would you like to die,
Tyrion son of Tywin?

267
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:01,709
In my own bed,
at the age of 80

268
00:21:01,743 --> 00:21:04,611
with a bellyful of wine and
a girl's mouth around my cock.

269
00:21:10,818 --> 00:21:13,020
Take the half man.

270
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:15,822
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.

271
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,958
No no no no no!

272
00:21:17,992 --> 00:21:21,061
My-- my House is rich
and powerful.

273
00:21:21,095 --> 00:21:23,763
If you see us
through these mountains,

274
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:25,766
my father will
shower you with gold.

275
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,835
We have no use
for a half man's promises.

276
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:32,440
Half a man maybe, but at least I have
the courage to face my enemies.

277
00:21:32,474 --> 00:21:34,075
What do the Stone Crows do?

278
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:36,344
Hide behind rocks
and shiver

279
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:39,347
when the knights
of the Vale ride by?

280
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,016
Are those the best weapons
you could steal?

281
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:45,253
Good enough
for killing sheep,

282
00:21:45,287 --> 00:21:47,021
if the sheep
don't fight back.

283
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,257
Lannister smiths
shit better steel.

284
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:58,332
You think you can win us over
with your trinkets?

285
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:12,614
That trinket is worth more than
everything your tribe owns.

286
00:22:14,518 --> 00:22:17,888
But if you help us,
Shagga Son of Dolf,

287
00:22:17,922 --> 00:22:20,591
I will not give you trinkets.

288
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:23,094
I will give you this.

289
00:22:23,996 --> 00:22:25,597
What is "this"?

290
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,300
The Vale of Arryn.

291
00:22:29,335 --> 00:22:32,637
The Lords of the Vale have always
spat upon the hill tribes.

292
00:22:33,706 --> 00:22:36,875
The Lords of the Vale
want me dead.

293
00:22:38,577 --> 00:22:41,679
I believe it is time
for new Lords of the Vale.

294
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,421
Ser Alliser:
<i>Now there's a rare sight--</i>

295
00:22:51,456 --> 00:22:54,958
not only a bastard,
but a traitor's bastard.

296
00:23:05,903 --> 00:23:08,705
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!

297
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:14,043
Blood will always tell.

298
00:23:14,077 --> 00:23:17,214
You'll hang
for this, bastard.

299
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,734
I told you not to do
anything stupid.

300
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:43,404
You're confined
to quarters. Go.

301
00:24:08,165 --> 00:24:10,099
Ghost, what's wrong?

302
00:24:11,235 --> 00:24:13,337
Is something out there?

303
00:24:45,202 --> 00:24:47,470
Commander?

304
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:53,510
Stay.

305
00:25:04,823 --> 00:25:07,058
Hello?

306
00:25:15,968 --> 00:25:17,002
Who's there?

307
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:26,745
Lord Commander?

308
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:55,075
<i>Snow?</i>

309
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,710
Commander!

310
00:26:10,992 --> 00:26:12,625
Move move!

311
00:26:31,245 --> 00:26:33,713
What did they do?

312
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:53,168
I thought the Dothraki
didn't believe in money.

313
00:26:53,202 --> 00:26:57,105
Gold to hire ships,
Princess,

314
00:26:57,139 --> 00:26:59,975
ships to sail
to Westeros.

315
00:27:15,758 --> 00:27:18,226
Jorah, make them stop.

316
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,494
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.

317
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:24,031
These men have shed blood for their Khal.
Now they claim their rewards.

318
00:27:34,878 --> 00:27:37,246
Princess, you have
a gentle heart,

319
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,282
<i>but this is how</i>
<i>it's always been.</i>

320
00:27:39,316 --> 00:27:42,285
I do not have
a gentle heart, Ser.

321
00:27:54,698 --> 00:27:57,199
<i>Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.</i>
<i>Me qorasokh anni!</i>

322
00:27:57,233 --> 00:28:01,369
- Come.
- Man: <i>Anha afichak mae m'arakhoon!</i>

323
00:28:06,608 --> 00:28:08,476
What do you want
done with them?

324
00:28:08,511 --> 00:28:11,078
Bring her to me.
And those women there.

325
00:28:12,948 --> 00:28:15,382
You cannot claim
them all, Princess.

326
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:17,451
I can,

327
00:28:17,485 --> 00:28:20,187
and I will.

328
00:28:20,222 --> 00:28:22,189
Me Fati!

329
00:28:22,223 --> 00:28:25,693
Khaleesi vazha
anhaan qorasokh anni,

330
00:28:25,727 --> 00:28:28,062
ch'anha afichak

331
00:28:28,096 --> 00:28:30,932
Me vastoe hatif anni;

332
00:28:30,966 --> 00:28:33,668
<i>ahhazaan</i>
<i>yer Nemo vacchaki.</i>

333
00:29:59,721 --> 00:30:02,623
<i>Ohos.</i>

334
00:30:03,925 --> 00:30:05,792
<i>Os.</i>

335
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:35,544
Thank you,
silver lady.

336
00:31:37,781 --> 00:31:40,248
Who are you?

337
00:31:40,283 --> 00:31:43,218
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the Godswife of this Temple.

338
00:31:44,887 --> 00:31:47,623
My mother was Godswife
here before me.

339
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:50,092
She taught me how to make
healing smokes and ointments.

340
00:31:50,126 --> 00:31:53,129
<i>All men are of one flock,</i>
<i>so my people believe.</i>

341
00:31:53,164 --> 00:31:55,265
The Great Shepherd sent me
to Earth to heal his--

342
00:32:00,906 --> 00:32:02,907
lamb or lion,

343
00:32:02,941 --> 00:32:05,610
his wound must be
washed and sewn

344
00:32:05,644 --> 00:32:07,911
<i>or it will fester.</i>

345
00:32:36,506 --> 00:32:39,809
For 30 years
I've been making corpses

346
00:32:39,843 --> 00:32:41,677
out of men, boy.

347
00:32:41,712 --> 00:32:44,446
I'm the man you want
leading the Vanguard.

348
00:32:45,815 --> 00:32:47,982
Galbart Glover
will lead the Van.

349
00:32:48,017 --> 00:32:50,684
The bloody Wall will melt

350
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:53,787
before an Umber marches
behind a Glover.

351
00:32:54,622 --> 00:32:56,857
<i>I</i> will lead the Van

352
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,192
or I will take my men

353
00:32:59,226 --> 00:33:01,327
and march them home.

354
00:33:06,266 --> 00:33:08,935
You are welcome
to do so, Lord Umber.

355
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:12,039
And when I am done
with the Lannisters

356
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,374
I will march back North,

357
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,876
root you out of your Keep

358
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,580
and hang you
for an oathbreaker.

359
00:33:18,614 --> 00:33:20,615
Oathbreaker, is it?!

360
00:33:22,184 --> 00:33:24,753
I'll not sit here
and swallow insults

361
00:33:24,787 --> 00:33:27,322
from a boy so green
he pisses grass.

362
00:33:41,503 --> 00:33:43,804
My Lord father taught me
it was death to bare steel

363
00:33:43,838 --> 00:33:45,906
<i>against your Liege Lord.</i>

364
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:50,244
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant
to cut my meat for me.

365
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:54,716
Your meat...

366
00:33:59,856 --> 00:34:02,525
is bloody tough.

367
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:36,128
- What is it? What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.

368
00:34:40,601 --> 00:34:44,170
- Where are you going?
- South. For father.

369
00:34:44,205 --> 00:34:45,906
But it's the middle
of the night.

370
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,074
The Lannisters have
spies everywhere.

371
00:34:48,109 --> 00:34:50,676
I don't want them
to know we're coming.

372
00:34:50,711 --> 00:34:53,413
They have
more men than we do.

373
00:34:53,447 --> 00:34:55,648
Aye, they do.

374
00:34:55,683 --> 00:34:57,750
Can't I come with you?

375
00:34:57,785 --> 00:35:00,286
I can ride now.
You've seen me riding.

376
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,422
And I won't get
in the way, I--

377
00:35:02,456 --> 00:35:04,991
There must always be
a Stark at Winterfell.

378
00:35:05,025 --> 00:35:07,160
Until I return
that will be you.

379
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:12,899
You are not to leave the castle walls
while we are gone. Do you understand?

380
00:35:15,537 --> 00:35:18,906
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.

381
00:35:18,941 --> 00:35:21,076
I will.

382
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,178
I'll send letters
whenever I can,

383
00:35:23,212 --> 00:35:25,448
but if you don't
hear from me,

384
00:35:25,482 --> 00:35:27,383
don't be scared.

385
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,691
Until I return.

386
00:35:54,914 --> 00:35:57,982
How long have you been
hiding out there?

387
00:35:58,017 --> 00:36:01,486
Robb will be looking for you
to say goodbye.

388
00:36:02,822 --> 00:36:04,756
They've all gone away.

389
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:07,726
They'll be back soon.
Robb will free father

390
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,962
and they'll come back
with mother.

391
00:36:11,631 --> 00:36:14,133
No, they won't.

392
00:36:18,806 --> 00:36:20,907
<i>Please watch</i>
<i>over Robb.</i>

393
00:36:20,941 --> 00:36:23,409
And watch over all the
other men from Winterfell.

394
00:36:23,443 --> 00:36:26,612
And Theon too,
I suppose.

395
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:35,087
You hear them, boy?

396
00:36:35,122 --> 00:36:37,723
The Old Gods are
answering you.

397
00:36:37,757 --> 00:36:39,658
What are you
doing here?

398
00:36:39,692 --> 00:36:42,561
They're my Gods too.

399
00:36:44,064 --> 00:36:47,667
Beyond the Wall,
they're the only Gods.

400
00:36:49,036 --> 00:36:51,338
Even slaves
are allowed to pray.

401
00:36:51,372 --> 00:36:53,740
You're not a slave.

402
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:58,779
Well, your friend did
put a knife to my throat.

403
00:36:59,914 --> 00:37:02,516
I'm not complaining,
Little Lord,

404
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:05,285
just telling truths.

405
00:37:06,587 --> 00:37:09,389
What did you mean
about hearing the Gods?

406
00:37:09,424 --> 00:37:11,758
You asked them,

407
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:13,426
they're answering you.

408
00:37:13,461 --> 00:37:16,430
Shh.

409
00:37:16,464 --> 00:37:18,131
Open your ears.

410
00:37:23,571 --> 00:37:25,805
It's only the wind.

411
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,842
Who do you think
sends the wind

412
00:37:28,876 --> 00:37:30,844
if not the Gods?

413
00:37:30,879 --> 00:37:32,580
They see you, boy.

414
00:37:32,614 --> 00:37:35,016
<i>They hear you.</i>

415
00:37:36,652 --> 00:37:39,488
Your brother will get no help
from them where he's going.

416
00:37:39,522 --> 00:37:42,324
The Old Gods have
no power in the South.

417
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:46,028
The Weirwoods there were
all cut down a long time ago.

418
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:48,832
How can they watch
when they have no eyes?

419
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:55,738
Well, there's a big man.

420
00:37:55,772 --> 00:37:58,941
He has giants' blood
in him or I'm the Queen.

421
00:37:58,975 --> 00:38:01,343
Go back and find
your clothes, Hodor.

422
00:38:01,377 --> 00:38:03,211
<i>Go dress.</i>

423
00:38:03,246 --> 00:38:04,779
Hodor.

424
00:38:07,917 --> 00:38:10,118
Are there really giants
beyond the Wall?

425
00:38:11,487 --> 00:38:14,456
Giants
and worse than giants.

426
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:17,459
I tried telling
your brother,

427
00:38:17,493 --> 00:38:19,294
he's marching
the wrong way.

428
00:38:19,328 --> 00:38:22,831
All these swords,
they should be going North, boy.

429
00:38:22,865 --> 00:38:25,033
North, not south!

430
00:38:27,771 --> 00:38:30,172
The cold winds are rising.

431
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,492
They were touched
by White Walkers.

432
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:51,996
That's why
they came back.

433
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,899
That's why their eyes
turned blue.

434
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:58,068
Only fire will
stop them.

435
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:01,772
How do you know that?

436
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:03,541
I read about it
in a book--

437
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:06,644
a very old book
in Maester Aemon's library.

438
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:11,315
What else
did the book say?

439
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,250
The White Walkers

440
00:39:13,285 --> 00:39:16,053
sleep beneath the ice
for thousands of years.

441
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:18,623
And when they wake up--

442
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:23,461
And when they
wake up, what?

443
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:28,933
I hope The Wall
is high enough.

444
00:40:01,464 --> 00:40:03,765
Summer snows, My Lady.

445
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,835
Robb's brought
the North with him.

446
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:14,910
The River Lords
are falling back

447
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:16,779
with Jaime Lannister
at their heels.

448
00:40:16,813 --> 00:40:20,216
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a
second Lannister army from the South.

449
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,020
Our scouts confirm it's even larger
than the Kingslayer's.

450
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:26,324
One army or two,
the Kings in the North

451
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:30,161
threw back hosts
10 times as large.

452
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:35,332
Mother!

453
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:40,970
You look well.

454
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:46,242
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome
sight in these troubled times.

455
00:40:46,276 --> 00:40:48,745
We had not thought
to meet you here, My Lady.

456
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:52,282
I had not thought
to be here.

457
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:54,384
I would speak
with my son alone.

458
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:56,720
I know you will
forgive me, My Lords.

459
00:40:56,755 --> 00:40:58,989
You heard her!
Move your asses!

460
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:01,359
Come on, out.

461
00:41:01,394 --> 00:41:04,029
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?

462
00:41:04,063 --> 00:41:05,965
Have no fear, My Lady.

463
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:08,767
<i>We'll shove our swords</i>
<i>up Tywin Lannister's bunghole</i>

464
00:41:08,801 --> 00:41:11,570
and then it's on to the Red Keep
to free Ned.

465
00:41:11,604 --> 00:41:14,538
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.

466
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:16,907
You're not
wasting away, are you?

467
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,987
I remember the day
you came into this world

468
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:34,057
red-faced and squalling.

469
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:38,228
And now I find you
leading a host to war.

470
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,665
- There was no one else.
- No one?

471
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,434
Who were those men
I saw here?

472
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:47,538
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.

473
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:50,608
If you think you can send me back
to Winterfell--

474
00:41:50,642 --> 00:41:52,910
Oh, would that I could.

475
00:41:55,981 --> 00:41:57,949
There was...

476
00:41:57,983 --> 00:42:00,418
a letter.

477
00:42:02,855 --> 00:42:04,290
From Sansa.

478
00:42:05,258 --> 00:42:07,559
From the Queen,
you mean.

479
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,635
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.

480
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:31,580
How many men
do you have?

481
00:42:31,614 --> 00:42:34,016
18,000.

482
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,518
If I go to King's Landing
and bend my knee to Joffrey--

483
00:42:36,552 --> 00:42:39,621
you would never
be allowed to leave. No.

484
00:42:39,655 --> 00:42:42,424
Our best hope--
our only hope--

485
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:45,761
is that you can defeat
them in the field.

486
00:42:45,795 --> 00:42:47,829
And if I lose?

487
00:42:47,863 --> 00:42:50,398
Do you know what happened
to the Targaryen children

488
00:42:50,433 --> 00:42:53,436
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.

489
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,172
On the orders
of Tywin Lannister.

490
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:58,909
And the years have
not made him kinder.

491
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:04,182
If you lose,

492
00:43:04,216 --> 00:43:06,918
your father dies,

493
00:43:06,952 --> 00:43:08,486
your sisters die,

494
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,754
<i>we</i> die.

495
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:15,358
Well, that makes it
simple then.

496
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:18,694
I suppose it does.

497
00:43:41,716 --> 00:43:44,951
From here it might be best if
Bronn and I continue alone.

498
00:43:44,986 --> 00:43:47,555
Best for Tyrion
son of Tywin.

499
00:43:47,589 --> 00:43:49,590
Not best for me.

500
00:43:49,624 --> 00:43:52,794
If the half man betrays us,

501
00:43:52,828 --> 00:43:56,264
Shagga Son of Dolf
will cut off his manhood--

502
00:43:56,299 --> 00:43:58,834
and feed it
to the goats, yes.

503
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:03,906
All right then.

504
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:06,142
Time to meet my father.

505
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:41,277
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.

506
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:43,179
Father.

507
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,683
The rumors of your demise
were unfounded.

508
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:51,119
Sorry
to disappoint you.

509
00:44:51,154 --> 00:44:53,689
And who are these...

510
00:44:53,723 --> 00:44:55,957
<i>Companions</i> of yours?

511
00:44:58,027 --> 00:45:00,460
This is Shagga
Son of Dolf,

512
00:45:00,495 --> 00:45:02,863
<i>Chieftain</i>
<i>of the Stone Crows.</i>

513
00:45:02,897 --> 00:45:07,267
<i>Timett Son of Timett,</i>
<i>ruler of the Burned Men.</i>

514
00:45:07,301 --> 00:45:12,039
<i>This fair maid is</i>
<i>Chella daughter of Cheyk,</i>

515
00:45:12,073 --> 00:45:14,442
<i>leader</i>
<i>of the Black Ears.</i>

516
00:45:14,476 --> 00:45:17,845
And here we have
Bronn son of...

517
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,482
You wouldn't know him.

518
00:45:22,485 --> 00:45:25,054
May I present
My Lord Father,

519
00:45:25,088 --> 00:45:27,723
Tywin son of Tytos
of House Lannister,

520
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:30,826
<i>Lord of Casterly Rock</i>
<i>and Warden of the West?</i>

521
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:35,432
Kind of you
to go to war for me.

522
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:40,403
You left us no choice.

523
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:42,505
The honor of the House
was at stake.

524
00:45:44,008 --> 00:45:47,177
Your brother would never have
submitted to capture so meekly.

525
00:45:47,212 --> 00:45:49,746
We have our differences,
Jaime and I.

526
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:51,949
He's braver.
I'm better looking.

527
00:45:51,983 --> 00:45:54,318
He's been covering himself
in glory.

528
00:45:54,353 --> 00:45:57,589
Jaime smashed the River Lords
at the Golden Tooth,

529
00:45:57,623 --> 00:46:01,292
and now lays siege to Riverrun,
Catelyn Stark's homeland.

530
00:46:01,326 --> 00:46:03,427
And the Starks?
Lord Eddard?

531
00:46:03,461 --> 00:46:07,531
--Is our hostage. He will lead
no armies from his dungeon cell.

532
00:46:07,566 --> 00:46:09,600
How did my sweet sister
persuade the King

533
00:46:09,634 --> 00:46:11,502
to imprison
his dear friend Ned?

534
00:46:11,537 --> 00:46:15,507
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.

535
00:46:18,512 --> 00:46:20,480
My sister rules,
you mean.

536
00:46:21,682 --> 00:46:23,983
Stark's son has
called his banners.

537
00:46:24,018 --> 00:46:27,454
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.

538
00:46:27,488 --> 00:46:29,255
One taste of battle
and he'll run

539
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:31,859
back to Winterfell
wi his tail between his legs.

540
00:46:33,061 --> 00:46:34,561
Maybe.

541
00:46:34,595 --> 00:46:37,164
Though the boy does have
a certain belligerence.

542
00:46:37,198 --> 00:46:39,700
You'd like him.

543
00:46:39,734 --> 00:46:43,771
While we're on
the subject of war,

544
00:46:43,805 --> 00:46:46,507
I made promises
to my friends here

545
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:48,909
and a Lannister
always pays his debts.

546
00:46:48,943 --> 00:46:52,012
<i>We shall require</i>
<i>3,000 helms and shields,</i>

547
00:46:52,047 --> 00:46:54,281
plus swords, pikes,

548
00:46:54,315 --> 00:46:56,116
gorgets, maces--

549
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:58,718
if it please My Lord,

550
00:46:58,752 --> 00:47:00,820
Ser Addam bids me report
that the Northmen

551
00:47:00,854 --> 00:47:02,254
have crossed the neck.

552
00:47:04,257 --> 00:47:06,725
The wolf rushes
into the lion's jaws.

553
00:47:06,759 --> 00:47:10,996
So be it. Kevan, command the
drummers beat assembly.

554
00:47:12,499 --> 00:47:15,635
And send word to Jaime that
I am moving against Robb Stark.

555
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:17,637
At once, My Lord.

556
00:47:30,586 --> 00:47:33,554
It is said that the men of the
Mountain clans are great warriors.

557
00:47:33,589 --> 00:47:35,323
Ride with me
against my enemies

558
00:47:35,357 --> 00:47:38,393
and you shall have all
my son promised you and more.

559
00:47:38,428 --> 00:47:40,662
Only if the half man
fights with us.

560
00:47:40,697 --> 00:47:44,133
Until we hold the steel
he pledged us,

561
00:47:44,168 --> 00:47:46,569
the little lion's
life is ours.

562
00:47:52,142 --> 00:47:54,811
<i>The scouts report</i>
<i>Lord Tywin moves north.</i>

563
00:47:54,845 --> 00:47:56,679
We need to get him
on broken ground,

564
00:47:56,714 --> 00:47:58,381
put his Knights
at a disadvantage.

565
00:47:58,415 --> 00:48:00,517
No, we need to get
around him

566
00:48:00,551 --> 00:48:03,453
and break Jaime Lannister's
siege of Riverrun.

567
00:48:03,488 --> 00:48:06,323
Do that and the River Lords
will join us.

568
00:48:06,357 --> 00:48:08,225
To do either we need to cross
the river

569
00:48:08,259 --> 00:48:09,926
and the only crossing
is at The Twins.

570
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,995
<i>Lord Frey controls</i>
<i>that bridge.</i>

571
00:48:12,029 --> 00:48:13,596
Your father's bannerman.

572
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:16,866
"The late Lord Frey"
my father calls him.

573
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:20,403
At the Trident, he didn't appear
until the battle was done.

574
00:48:20,437 --> 00:48:24,474
Some men takes their oaths
more seriously than others.

575
00:48:31,882 --> 00:48:34,617
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.

576
00:48:34,651 --> 00:48:36,752
So what's it going to be?

577
00:48:36,787 --> 00:48:40,189
Do we move against
Jaime or Lord Tywin?

578
00:48:44,361 --> 00:48:45,895
Your pardon, my lords.

579
00:48:45,929 --> 00:48:48,598
<i>We've captured</i>
<i>a Lannister scout.</i>

580
00:48:50,501 --> 00:48:53,837
Don't worry, lad. He won't b
leaving this tent with his head.

581
00:48:55,173 --> 00:48:56,840
Where did you find him?

582
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:59,009
In the brush above
the encampment.

583
00:48:59,043 --> 00:49:00,911
<i>He looked to be counting.</i>

584
00:49:11,356 --> 00:49:13,157
How high did you get?

585
00:49:15,527 --> 00:49:17,528
20,000.
Maybe more.

586
00:49:18,563 --> 00:49:20,297
You don't have
to do this yourself.

587
00:49:20,331 --> 00:49:21,898
Your father
would understand--

588
00:49:21,933 --> 00:49:25,969
My father unrstands mercy,
when there is room for it.

589
00:49:27,371 --> 00:49:29,205
And he understands honor...

590
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:34,277
and courage.

591
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,014
Let him go.

592
00:49:38,983 --> 00:49:41,384
Robb.

593
00:49:53,396 --> 00:49:56,364
Tell Lord Tywin
Winter is coming for him.

594
00:49:56,398 --> 00:50:01,335
20,000 Northerners marching south
to find out if he really does shit gold.

595
00:50:03,405 --> 00:50:04,905
Yes, My Lord.

596
00:50:04,939 --> 00:50:06,741
Thank you, My Lord.

597
00:50:16,185 --> 00:50:19,887
Are you touched, boy?!
Letting him go?

598
00:50:19,922 --> 00:50:21,957
You call me boy again.

599
00:50:23,459 --> 00:50:25,093
Go on.

600
00:50:42,109 --> 00:50:45,311
Oi.

601
00:50:50,383 --> 00:50:53,052
<i>It is also the wish</i>
<i>of His Grace</i>

602
00:50:53,087 --> 00:50:58,392
<i>that his loyal servant</i>
<i>Janos Slynt,</i>

603
00:50:58,426 --> 00:51:01,529
- <i>Commander of the City Watch...</i>
- Ser Aron.

604
00:51:01,563 --> 00:51:05,133
<i>...Be at once raised</i>
<i>to the rank of Lord...</i>

605
00:51:05,167 --> 00:51:10,638
- Lord Gyles.
- <i>...And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal,</i>

606
00:51:10,672 --> 00:51:14,508
<i>and that his sons and grandsons</i>
<i>shall hold this honor</i>

607
00:51:14,542 --> 00:51:19,646
<i>after him</i>
<i>until the end of time.</i>

608
00:51:23,483 --> 00:51:26,818
In the place of the traitor
Eddard Stark,

609
00:51:26,853 --> 00:51:31,523
<i>it is the wish of his Grace</i>
<i>that Tywin Lannister,</i>

610
00:51:31,557 --> 00:51:35,360
<i>Lord of Casterly Rock</i>
<i>and Warden of the West,</i>

611
00:51:35,395 --> 00:51:39,498
<i>be appointed</i>
<i>Hand of the King.</i>

612
00:51:39,532 --> 00:51:41,433
Lastly,

613
00:51:41,468 --> 00:51:44,302
in these times
of treason and turmoil,

614
00:51:44,336 --> 00:51:47,572
<i>it is the view</i>
<i>of the Council</i>

615
00:51:47,607 --> 00:51:50,141
that the life and safety

616
00:51:50,176 --> 00:51:52,844
of King Joffrey

617
00:51:52,878 --> 00:51:57,115
be of paramount importance.

618
00:51:58,718 --> 00:52:01,252
Ser Barristan Selmy.

619
00:52:07,593 --> 00:52:11,096
Your Grace, I am
yours to command.

620
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:13,232
Rise, Ser Barristan.

621
00:52:14,101 --> 00:52:16,202
You may remove
your helm.

622
00:52:21,143 --> 00:52:23,745
<i>You have served the Realm</i>
<i>long and faithfully.</i>

623
00:52:23,779 --> 00:52:27,749
<i>Every man and woman in the</i>
<i>Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.</i>

624
00:52:27,784 --> 00:52:31,052
But it is time to put aside
your armor and your sword.

625
00:52:31,086 --> 00:52:33,989
<i>It is time to rest</i>
<i>and look back with pride</i>

626
00:52:34,023 --> 00:52:35,657
on your many years
of service.

627
00:52:37,861 --> 00:52:40,295
Your Grace, the Kingsguard
is a sworn brotherhood.

628
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:42,497
<i>Our vows are</i>
<i>taken for life.</i>

629
00:52:42,532 --> 00:52:45,034
Only death relieves us
of our sacred trust.

630
00:52:45,068 --> 00:52:48,771
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your King's?

631
00:52:48,805 --> 00:52:51,674
<i>You let my father die.</i>

632
00:52:51,708 --> 00:52:54,644
You're too old
to protect anybody.

633
00:52:56,948 --> 00:52:59,683
- Your Grace--
- The Council has determined

634
00:52:59,717 --> 00:53:02,152
that Ser Jaime Lannister
will take your place

635
00:53:02,187 --> 00:53:04,455
<i>as Lord Commander</i>
<i>of the Kingsguard.</i>

636
00:53:04,489 --> 00:53:06,023
The man who
profaned his blade

637
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:08,259
with the blood of the King
he had sworn to defend!

638
00:53:08,293 --> 00:53:10,227
Careful, Ser.

639
00:53:10,261 --> 00:53:11,962
We have nothing
but gratitude

640
00:53:11,996 --> 00:53:14,465
for your long service,
good Ser.

641
00:53:14,499 --> 00:53:16,967
You shall be given
a stout Keep beside the sea,

642
00:53:17,001 --> 00:53:19,336
with servants
to look after your every need.

643
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:21,571
A hall to die in

644
00:53:21,606 --> 00:53:24,007
<i>and men to bury me.</i>

645
00:53:25,609 --> 00:53:28,645
I am a Knight.

646
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:31,715
I shall die a Knight.

647
00:53:37,655 --> 00:53:39,790
A naked Knight,
apparently.

648
00:53:50,935 --> 00:53:54,371
Even now I could cut through
the five of you like carving a cake!

649
00:53:58,543 --> 00:54:01,077
Here, boy!

650
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:03,547
Melt it down and add it
to the others.

651
00:54:20,063 --> 00:54:22,398
If any man in this hall
has other matters

652
00:54:22,432 --> 00:54:25,567
to set before His Grace,
let him speak now

653
00:54:25,602 --> 00:54:28,838
or go forth and hold
his silence.

654
00:54:31,509 --> 00:54:33,644
Your Grace.

655
00:54:33,678 --> 00:54:36,047
Come forward,
My Lady.

656
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:40,552
<i>The Lady Sansa</i>
<i>of House Stark.</i>

657
00:54:42,088 --> 00:54:45,490
Do you have some business for
the King and the Council, Sansa?

658
00:54:45,525 --> 00:54:47,359
I do.

659
00:54:52,231 --> 00:54:55,333
As it please Your Grace,
I ask mercy for my father,

660
00:54:55,367 --> 00:54:58,837
Lord Eddard Stark,
who was Hand of the King.

661
00:54:58,871 --> 00:55:01,739
Treason is a noxious weed.

662
00:55:01,774 --> 00:55:05,944
- It should be torn out, root--
- Let her speak.

663
00:55:05,979 --> 00:55:08,681
I want to hear
what she says.

664
00:55:08,715 --> 00:55:10,850
Thank you, Your Grace.

665
00:55:10,884 --> 00:55:13,487
Do you deny
your father's crime?

666
00:55:13,521 --> 00:55:17,992
No, My Lords.
I know he must be punished.

667
00:55:18,026 --> 00:55:20,027
All I ask is mercy.

668
00:55:20,062 --> 00:55:22,931
<i>I know My Lord father</i>
<i>must regret what he did.</i>

669
00:55:22,965 --> 00:55:25,267
He was King Robert's friend
and he loved him.

670
00:55:25,301 --> 00:55:27,502
You all know he loved him.

671
00:55:27,537 --> 00:55:31,139
He never wanted to be Hand
until the King asked him.

672
00:55:31,173 --> 00:55:34,575
They must have lied to him--
Lord Renly or Lord Stannis

673
00:55:34,609 --> 00:55:37,411
or somebody.
They must have lied!

674
00:55:37,446 --> 00:55:39,914
He said
I wasn't the King.

675
00:55:39,948 --> 00:55:42,015
Why did he say that?

676
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:44,318
He was badly hurt.

677
00:55:44,352 --> 00:55:47,220
Maester Pycelle was giving
him milk of the poppy.

678
00:55:47,254 --> 00:55:51,424
He wasn't himself. Otherwise h
never would have said it.

679
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,630
A child's faith...
Such sweet innocence.

680
00:55:57,664 --> 00:56:01,334
<i>And yet they say</i>
<i>wisdom oft comes</i>

681
00:56:01,369 --> 00:56:03,203
from the mouths of babes.

682
00:56:03,237 --> 00:56:07,374
Treason
is treason!

683
00:56:10,512 --> 00:56:12,679
Anything else?

684
00:56:14,249 --> 00:56:17,651
If you still have any affection
in your heart for me,

685
00:56:17,685 --> 00:56:21,187
please do me
this kindness, Your Grace.

686
00:56:30,764 --> 00:56:33,031
Your sweet words
have moved me.

687
00:56:35,435 --> 00:56:38,002
But your father has
to confess.

688
00:56:38,037 --> 00:56:41,639
He has to confess
and say that I'm the King...

689
00:56:44,542 --> 00:56:46,677
Or there'll be
no mercy for him.

690
00:56:51,149 --> 00:56:53,250
He will.
