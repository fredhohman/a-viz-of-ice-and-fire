(cawing)

00:02:56,314 --> 00:02:58,732
<i>(dog barking)</i>

5
00:03:17,752 --> 00:03:20,671
— You’re wearing a black cloak again.

6
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:23,557
— I’ve been sent to negotiate with you.

7
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:54,922
— It appears my trusting nature got the better of me.

8
00:03:54,956 --> 00:03:57,174
— It’s happened before.

9
00:03:57,208 --> 00:04:01,011
— I was hoping your loyalty was real when
you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow.

10
00:04:01,046 --> 00:04:02,796
— Truly I was.

11
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:04,682
— The Halfhand ordered me to join your army

12
00:04:04,716 --> 00:04:07,468
— and bring back whatever information
I could to Castle Black.

13
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,970
— He made me kill him so you’d trust me.

14
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:11,605
— I was loyal…

15
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:14,274
— to him and to my Night’s Watch vows.

16
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:16,226
— All your vows?

17
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:21,982
— She wasn’t enough to turn you, eh?

18
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:24,151
— Were you enough to turn her?

19
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:26,987
— She put three arrows in me

20
00:04:26,989 --> 00:04:29,073
— when I escaped.

21
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,659
— Did you see her again at Castle Black?

22
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:35,913
— Yes.
— And?

23
00:04:35,964 --> 00:04:38,132
— She’s dead.

24
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,503
— Your doing?
— No.

25
00:04:44,506 --> 00:04:46,006
— We’ll drink to her.

26
00:05:09,414 --> 00:05:11,582
— Of all the ways I’d kill you,

27
00:05:11,616 --> 00:05:14,034
— poison would be the last.

28
00:05:17,172 --> 00:05:19,423
— Ygritte.
— Ygritte.

29
00:05:23,762 --> 00:05:26,764
— (coughs)

30
00:05:28,883 --> 00:05:30,134
— That’s not wine.

31
00:05:30,185 --> 00:05:33,220
— No, it’s a proper northern drink, Jon Snow.

32
00:05:33,222 --> 00:05:36,440
— You did well. Fought hard.

33
00:05:36,474 --> 00:05:38,559
— Killed some of our strongest men.

34
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:41,311
— One of our giants went into your tunnel

35
00:05:41,362 --> 00:05:43,614
— and never came out again.

36
00:05:43,648 --> 00:05:45,566
— Mag the Mighty.

37
00:05:45,617 --> 00:05:47,451
— He’s dead.

38
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:49,620
— He killed my friend Grenn.

39
00:05:49,654 --> 00:05:51,038
— He was their king.

40
00:05:51,072 --> 00:05:53,707
— The last of a bloodline that stretches back

41
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:55,793
— before the First Men.

42
00:05:55,827 --> 00:05:57,744
— Grenn came from a farm.

43
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,918
— Mag and Grenn.
— Grenn and Mag.

44
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:10,257
— Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat?

45
00:06:10,308 --> 00:06:13,227
— I don’t imagine our guest has eaten anything

46
00:06:13,261 --> 00:06:15,095
— for quite some time.

47
00:06:16,314 --> 00:06:20,400
— So, you’re here to strike a bargain?

48
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:24,154
— Turn your army around and go home.

49
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:26,440
— You know I know you’re low on arrows,

50
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:28,522
— you’re low on oil, you’re low on men.

51
00:06:28,526 --> 00:06:30,410
— How many are left, 50?

52
00:06:30,445 --> 00:06:32,446
— I told Tormund and Orell.

53
00:06:32,448 --> 00:06:34,198
— We have more than 1,000 men.

54
00:06:34,249 --> 00:06:35,999
— I showed you everything I had.

55
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:37,835
— The whole army, 100,000 strong.

56
00:06:37,869 --> 00:06:41,121
— And what did you do? You fired
on us with everything you had.

57
00:06:41,123 --> 00:06:43,790
— It wasn’t much. As soon as I saw that,

58
00:06:43,842 --> 00:06:47,127
— I sent 400 men to climb the Wall,

59
00:06:47,178 --> 00:06:49,546
— an unmanned stretch five miles west of here.

60
00:06:49,597 --> 00:06:51,465
— A lot of them will die climbing,

61
00:06:51,516 --> 00:06:53,517
— but most of them will be over by the end of the day.

62
00:06:53,551 --> 00:06:56,803
— <i>It’s me being honest with you, Jon Snow,</i>

63
00:06:56,805 --> 00:06:59,306
— <i>which is more than you’ve ever done for me.</i>

64
00:06:59,357 --> 00:07:01,141
— My people have bled enough.

65
00:07:01,192 --> 00:07:02,976
— We’re not here to conquer.

66
00:07:03,027 --> 00:07:06,029
— We’re here to hide behind your Wall.

67
00:07:06,064 --> 00:07:10,317
— Just like you. We need your tunnel.

68
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,537
— Now we both know that winter is coming.

69
00:07:13,571 --> 00:07:17,157
— And if my people aren’t south of
the Wall when it comes in earnest,

70
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,159
— we’ll all end up worse than dead.

71
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:22,045
— You want to strike a bargain with me?

72
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,547
— Here’s the bargain.

73
00:07:23,581 --> 00:07:25,999
— You go back, you open the gates to us,

74
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,336
— and I swear to you that no one else will die.

75
00:07:29,387 --> 00:07:31,672
— Refuse,

76
00:07:31,723 --> 00:07:34,558
— and we’ll kill every last man at Castle Black.

77
00:07:36,761 --> 00:07:37,928
— Ah!

78
00:07:40,732 --> 00:07:44,985
— Oh, that’s why you’re here.

79
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:48,655
— I reckon you could do it before
any of them could stop you.

80
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,657
— They’d kill you, of course.

81
00:07:50,692 --> 00:07:51,932
— They’d kill you slow.

82
00:07:51,943 --> 00:07:55,195
— But you knew that when you came in here.

83
00:07:56,364 --> 00:07:59,449
— Are you capable of that, Jon Snow?

84
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,370
— Killing a man in his own tent
when he’s just offered you peace?

85
00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:05,422
— Is that what the Night’s Watch is?

86
00:08:05,456 --> 00:08:07,874
— Is that what you are?

87
00:08:10,678 --> 00:08:14,047
— <i> (horn blows)</i>
— Man:<i> Riders coming!</i>

88
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:15,716
— Are you attacking us?
— No.

89
00:08:15,718 --> 00:08:17,718
— It’s like you said, we don’t have the men.

90
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,470
— <i> (horn blowing)</i>
— <i> (dogs barking)</i>

91
00:08:24,225 --> 00:08:26,777
(men shouting)

92
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:33,617
(horse whinnies)

93
00:08:45,213 --> 00:08:47,748
— Hold! To me! To me!

94
00:09:00,395 --> 00:09:02,396
(men shouting)

95
00:09:59,987 --> 00:10:02,122
— Stand down!

96
00:10:03,574 --> 00:10:05,876
— I said my people have bled enough

97
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,245
— and I meant it.

98
00:10:36,607 --> 00:10:38,492
(shouting)

99
00:10:42,196 --> 00:10:44,197
Man: — <i>Round them up.</i>

100
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:45,866
— <i>Stay with the horses.</i>

101
00:10:55,376 --> 00:10:57,761
— You’re the King-beyond-the-Wall?

102
00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:03,049
— Do you know who I am?
— Never had the pleasure.

103
00:11:03,051 --> 00:11:04,468
— This is Stannis Baratheon,

104
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:06,269
— the one true king of the Seven Kingdoms.

105
00:11:06,304 --> 00:11:09,344
— We’re not in the Seven Kingdoms and
you’re not dressed for this weather.

106
00:11:10,641 --> 00:11:13,777
— It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.

107
00:11:20,118 --> 00:11:22,035
— We do not kneel.

108
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:24,571
— I’ll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall,

109
00:11:24,573 --> 00:11:26,790
— have nowhere to put them, have nothing to feed them.

110
00:11:26,824 --> 00:11:29,793
— I’m not here to slaughter beat dogs.

111
00:11:29,827 --> 00:11:33,130
— Their fate depends on their king.

112
00:11:33,164 --> 00:11:37,134
— All the same, we do not kneel.

113
00:11:39,754 --> 00:11:42,422
— Take these men away.

114
00:11:42,424 --> 00:11:45,175
— What’s a man of the Night’s
Watch doing in a wildling camp?

115
00:11:47,094 --> 00:11:49,930
— I was sent to discuss terms
with the King-beyond-the-Wall.

116
00:11:49,981 --> 00:11:51,621
— You’re speaking to the one true king, boy.

117
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:54,151
— You will address him as Your Grace.

118
00:11:54,185 --> 00:11:57,487
— I know he’s the king. My father died for him.

119
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,192
— My name is Jon Snow, Your Grace.

120
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:04,578
— I’m Ned Stark’s son.

121
00:12:06,948 --> 00:12:09,583
— Your father was an honorable man.

122
00:12:09,617 --> 00:12:11,501
— He was, Your Grace.

123
00:12:11,536 --> 00:12:13,737
— What do you think he’d have done with him?

124
00:12:19,343 --> 00:12:21,795
— I was this man’s prisoner once.

125
00:12:21,846 --> 00:12:25,098
— He could have tortured me. He could have killed me.

126
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,718
— <i>But he spared my life.</i>

127
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:30,971
— I think my father would have taken him prisoner,

128
00:12:30,973 --> 00:12:33,056
— listened to what he had to say.

129
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:38,728
— Very well, then. Take him.

130
00:12:44,869 --> 00:12:47,070
— Your Grace.

131
00:12:47,121 --> 00:12:49,873
— <i>If my father had seen the things that I’ve seen,</i>

132
00:12:49,907 --> 00:12:53,293
— he’d also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall.

133
00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:56,329
— All of them.

134
00:13:02,003 --> 00:13:05,005
<i>(flies buzzing)</i>

135
00:13:05,056 --> 00:13:07,674
— I would suggest milk of the poppy

136
00:13:07,725 --> 00:13:10,343
— to ease his pain, but he is completely insensate.

137
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:11,811
— Bloody Martells.

138
00:13:11,846 --> 00:13:13,847
— The cause appears to be manticore venom.

139
00:13:13,898 --> 00:13:16,182
— It is. The Death’s Head manticore.

140
00:13:16,234 --> 00:13:19,853
— Yes, I’ve read a great deal about it.

141
00:13:19,904 --> 00:13:21,855
— It’s a horrible poison.

142
00:13:21,857 --> 00:13:24,574
— Usually Mantari in origin.

143
00:13:24,609 --> 00:13:26,493
— Oh! Yes, yes.

144
00:13:26,527 --> 00:13:28,028
— There’s nothing to be done.

145
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,496
— Yes, there is.

146
00:13:30,865 --> 00:13:33,867
— May I ask what you think you’re doing?

147
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:35,285
— Saving him.

148
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:37,254
— Your Grace, I wish it were otherwise,

149
00:13:37,288 --> 00:13:39,706
— but Ser Gregor is beyond saving.

150
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,259
— Well, well beyond.

151
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:44,878
— This man is not even a maester,

152
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,713
— let alone Grand Maester.

153
00:13:46,764 --> 00:13:48,465
— That’s for the best.

154
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:49,883
— No maester knows how to save him.

155
00:13:49,885 --> 00:13:52,018
— That is exactly the sort of arrogance

156
00:13:52,053 --> 00:13:55,021
— that had him expelled from the Citadel, Your Grace.

157
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:58,892
— His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural.

158
00:13:58,943 --> 00:14:01,144
— Rightly so, in my opinion.

159
00:14:01,195 --> 00:14:03,730
— You’re dismissed, Grand Maester.

160
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,286
— But, Your Grace, this is my laboratory.

161
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,072
— Not anymore.
Pycelle: — <i>But I…</i>

162
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,242
(scoffs)

163
00:14:17,128 --> 00:14:18,995
<i>(door opens)</i>

164
00:14:19,046 --> 00:14:22,082
— You can save him?
— Difficult to say, Your Grace.

165
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:24,374
— <i>But if my past work is any guide…</i>

166
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:26,136
<i>(door slams)</i>

167
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,921
— …we stand a chance.

168
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:30,557
— Do everything you can.

169
00:14:30,591 --> 00:14:32,258
— Come to me for anything you need.

170
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,760
— Thank you, Your Grace.

171
00:14:33,811 --> 00:14:35,729
— <i>You should know,</i>

172
00:14:35,763 --> 00:14:38,815
— the process may change him…

173
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:41,935
— somewhat.

174
00:14:44,105 --> 00:14:46,056
— Will it weaken him?

175
00:14:47,191 --> 00:14:48,775
— Oh, no.

176
00:14:48,826 --> 00:14:50,944
— Very well, then.

177
00:15:09,296 --> 00:15:11,297
Tywin: — <i>Not another word.</i>

178
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:13,800
— We’ve been over this. The matter’s closed.

179
00:15:13,802 --> 00:15:16,886
— I’m opening it again.

180
00:15:16,937 --> 00:15:19,973
— You were betrothed to Loras Tyrell.

181
00:15:20,024 --> 00:15:22,525
— You’re still betrothed to Loras Tyrell.

182
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,644
— And you will marry Loras Tyrell

183
00:15:24,695 --> 00:15:26,980
— as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.

184
00:15:27,064 --> 00:15:28,398
— I will not.

185
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:31,434
— Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands.

186
00:15:31,469 --> 00:15:34,710
— Tyrion’s sentence will be carried out tomorrow.

187
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,826
— You have on several occasions made great claims

188
00:15:39,828 --> 00:15:42,495
— about your commitment to this family’s future.

189
00:15:42,546 --> 00:15:44,381
— Your role in that future

190
00:15:44,415 --> 00:15:46,583
— is more vital now than it ever was.

191
00:15:46,634 --> 00:15:48,501
— I don’t care.

192
00:15:48,552 --> 00:15:51,971
— I will stay in King’s Landing where
I belong with my son the king.

193
00:15:52,006 --> 00:15:55,225
— When you were nine years old,
I was called to the capital.

194
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:58,011
— I decided to take your
brother with me and not you.

195
00:15:58,045 --> 00:16:01,564
— You insisted that you would
not be left at Casterly Rock

196
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:04,401
— under any circumstances. And if you recall–

197
00:16:04,435 --> 00:16:06,519
— I’m not interested in hearing
another one of your smug stories

198
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,738
— about the time you won.

199
00:16:08,773 --> 00:16:10,740
— This isn’t going to be one of those times.

200
00:16:10,775 --> 00:16:12,826
— Do you think you’ll be the first person

201
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,912
— dragged into a sept to be married against her will?

202
00:16:15,946 --> 00:16:17,914
— When you marched into the throne room to tell me

203
00:16:17,948 --> 00:16:21,149
— we’d won the Battle of Blackwater… Do you remember?

204
00:16:22,503 --> 00:16:25,588
— I was sitting on the Iron Throne with Tommen.

205
00:16:25,623 --> 00:16:27,290
— I was about to give him essence of nightshade.

206
00:16:27,341 --> 00:16:29,209
— That’s how far I was willing to go when I thought

207
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,011
— someone awful had come to take my son away.

208
00:16:34,048 --> 00:16:36,433
— Someone awful is coming to take him away.

209
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:38,635
— No.
— Joffrey is dead.

210
00:16:38,686 --> 00:16:41,054
— Myrcella’s been sold like livestock.

211
00:16:41,105 --> 00:16:44,057
— And now you want to ship me off
to Highgarden and steal my boy.

212
00:16:44,108 --> 00:16:46,526
— My last boy.

213
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,561
— Margaery will dig her claws in,

214
00:16:48,612 --> 00:16:51,030
— you will dig your claws in
and you’ll fight over him

215
00:16:51,065 --> 00:16:53,233
— like beasts until you rip him apart.

216
00:16:53,235 --> 00:16:56,986
— I will burn our house to the
ground before I let that happen.

217
00:16:57,037 --> 00:17:00,073
— And how will you do that?

218
00:17:00,075 --> 00:17:03,076
— I’ll tell everyone the truth.

219
00:17:03,078 --> 00:17:05,245
— <i>What truth would that be?</i>

220
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,417
— You don’t know, do you?

221
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:16,005
— You never believed it.

222
00:17:16,974 --> 00:17:19,092
— How is that possible?

223
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:23,179
— What am I saying? Of course it’s possible.

224
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:26,983
— How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family

225
00:17:27,017 --> 00:17:30,017
— have any conception what his actual family was doing?

226
00:17:31,438 --> 00:17:34,324
— We were right there in front
of you and you didn’t see us.

227
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:36,493
— One look in the past 20 years,

228
00:17:36,527 --> 00:17:39,496
— one real look at your own children
and you would have known.

229
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,031
— Known what?

230
00:17:42,082 --> 00:17:44,450
— Everything they say is true.

231
00:17:44,502 --> 00:17:46,119
— About Jaime and me.
— No.

232
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:48,922
— Your legacy is a lie.
— No, no, no, no.

233
00:17:48,956 --> 00:17:51,791
— I don’t believe you.

234
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:56,963
— Yes, you do.

235
00:18:14,064 --> 00:18:16,816
— Jaime.

236
00:18:16,818 --> 00:18:19,068
— You won.

237
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:21,871
— One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself.

238
00:18:21,906 --> 00:18:24,207
— There’s really nothing you wouldn’t do, is there?

239
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:25,992
— For my family, no, nothing.

240
00:18:25,994 --> 00:18:28,378
— I would do things for my
family you couldn’t imagine.

241
00:18:28,412 --> 00:18:30,914
— Tyrion is your family.
— He’s not.

242
00:18:30,965 --> 00:18:33,833
— You don’t get to choose.
— I do. So do you.

243
00:18:33,835 --> 00:18:37,170
— You can choose the creature that killed
our mother to come into this world–

244
00:18:37,221 --> 00:18:39,505
— Are you really mad enough to blame him for that?

245
00:18:39,557 --> 00:18:42,425
— <i>He didn’t decide to kill her. He was an infant.</i>

246
00:18:42,476 --> 00:18:44,310
— A disease doesn’t decide to kill you.

247
00:18:44,345 --> 00:18:47,063
— All the same, you cut it out before it does.

248
00:18:47,097 --> 00:18:50,066
— What do you decide? What do you choose?

249
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,601
— The things I did to get back to you,

250
00:18:51,652 --> 00:18:54,520
— to endure all that, only to find you–

251
00:18:57,441 --> 00:18:59,492
— I choose you.

252
00:18:59,526 --> 00:19:01,160
— Those are words.
— Yes.

253
00:19:01,195 --> 00:19:03,496
— Like the ones I just said to Father.

254
00:19:04,615 --> 00:19:06,199
— I told him.

255
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,084
— Told him what?

256
00:19:08,118 --> 00:19:10,169
— I told him about us.

257
00:19:11,422 --> 00:19:12,872
— You told him?

258
00:19:12,874 --> 00:19:14,924
— I told him I won’t marry Loras Tyrell.

259
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:18,628
— I told him I’m staying right here
with Tommen, with you.

260
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:20,096
— You think he’ll just accept that?

261
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:24,523
— Go and ask him.

262
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:25,825
— What did you say?

263
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:28,194
— I don’t want to talk about Tywin Lannister.

264
00:19:28,196 --> 00:19:30,830
— I don’t choose Tywin Lannister.

265
00:19:30,864 --> 00:19:32,615
— I don’t love Tywin Lannister.

266
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,867
— I love my brother.

267
00:19:34,918 --> 00:19:36,836
— I love my lover.

268
00:19:38,121 --> 00:19:40,289
— People will whisper, they’ll make their jokes.

269
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,707
— Let them.

270
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:44,376
— They’re all so small, I can’t even see them.

271
00:19:44,427 --> 00:19:46,679
— I only see what matters.

272
00:19:55,555 --> 00:19:57,022
— Someone will walk in.

273
00:19:57,057 --> 00:19:58,557
— I don’t care.

274
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,402
—

275
00:20:10,522 --> 00:20:11,707
—

276
00:20:11,827 --> 00:20:13,317
—

277
00:20:13,557 --> 00:20:17,125
—

278
00:20:17,711 --> 00:20:20,193
—

279
00:20:20,746 --> 00:20:23,662
—

280
00:20:24,134 --> 00:20:30,358
—

281
00:20:35,182 --> 00:20:38,347
— I can speak the common tongue if you wish.

282
00:20:38,398 --> 00:20:39,982
— You speak it very well.

283
00:20:40,016 --> 00:20:43,936
— Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal.

284
00:20:43,938 --> 00:20:45,988
— I was tutor to his children.

285
00:20:46,022 --> 00:20:48,023
— <i>I taught them languages and history.</i>

286
00:20:48,074 --> 00:20:52,111
— They know a great deal about your family because of me.

287
00:20:52,162 --> 00:20:55,281
— <i>Little Calla is only seven,</i>

288
00:20:55,315 --> 00:20:57,666
— but she admires you very much.

289
00:20:57,701 --> 00:21:00,486
— I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration.

290
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,838
— What can I do for you?

291
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,709
— When you took the city, the children begged me

292
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,295
— not to leave the house.

293
00:21:09,297 --> 00:21:13,048
— But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must.

294
00:21:13,099 --> 00:21:15,935
— So I lost my home.

295
00:21:17,804 --> 00:21:19,855
— Now I live on the streets.

296
00:21:19,889 --> 00:21:21,473
— I have outfitted mess halls

297
00:21:21,524 --> 00:21:23,976
— to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.

298
00:21:24,027 --> 00:21:26,745
— I do not mean to offend, Your Grace.

299
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,615
— <i>I went to one of these places.</i>

300
00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:31,951
— The young prey on the old.

301
00:21:31,985 --> 00:21:35,504
— Take what they want and beat us if we resist.

302
00:21:35,538 --> 00:21:37,856
— My Unsullied will make them
safe again in short order,

303
00:21:37,891 --> 00:21:39,625
— my friend, this I promise you.

304
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:43,429
— Even if they are safe, who would I be there?

305
00:21:43,463 --> 00:21:46,165
— What purpose would I serve?

306
00:21:46,216 --> 00:21:49,635
— <i>With my master, I was a teacher.</i>

307
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:53,505
— I had the respect and love of his children.

308
00:21:53,507 --> 00:21:55,541
— What is it that you want from me?

309
00:21:55,575 --> 00:21:58,560
— Your Grace, I ask you

310
00:21:58,595 --> 00:22:01,563
— to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal.

311
00:22:01,598 --> 00:22:04,149
— You want to return to a man who owned you

312
00:22:04,184 --> 00:22:06,685
— like a goat or a chair?

313
00:22:06,736 --> 00:22:08,437
— Please, Your Grace.

314
00:22:08,488 --> 00:22:11,440
— The young may rejoice in the new
world you have built for them,

315
00:22:11,491 --> 00:22:14,493
— but for those of us too old to change,

316
00:22:14,527 --> 00:22:18,597
— there is only fear and squalor.

317
00:22:19,532 --> 00:22:21,533
— I am not alone.

318
00:22:21,535 --> 00:22:25,170
— There are many outside waiting to beg the same of you.

319
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:27,089
— I did not take this city to preside

320
00:22:27,123 --> 00:22:29,541
— over the injustice I fought to destroy.

321
00:22:29,592 --> 00:22:33,270
— I took it to bring people freedom.

322
00:22:33,304 --> 00:22:36,723
— But freedom means making your own choices.

323
00:22:36,774 --> 00:22:40,694
— I will allow you to sign a
contract with your former master.

324
00:22:40,728 --> 00:22:44,231
— It may not cover a period
lasting longer than a year.

325
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:46,566
— Thank you, Your Grace.

326
00:22:48,403 --> 00:22:50,070
— Thank you.

327
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:58,569
— The masters will take advantage of this situation.

328
00:22:59,464 --> 00:23:01,248
— The men serving them

329
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,884
— will be slaves in all but name.

330
00:23:10,591 --> 00:23:12,893
— Approach, my friend.

331
00:23:18,802 --> 00:23:20,523
—

332
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:24,403
—

333
00:23:24,523 --> 00:23:26,940
—

334
00:23:32,764 --> 00:23:34,781
(sobbing)

335
00:23:34,832 --> 00:23:37,033
(speaking low Valyrian)

336
00:23:37,085 --> 00:23:39,169
Missandei: — <i>I have brought you–</i>

337
00:23:43,357 --> 00:23:45,292
— He came from the sky.

338
00:23:47,011 --> 00:23:49,296
— <i>The black one.</i>

339
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:54,935
— The winged shadow.

340
00:23:56,304 --> 00:23:58,638
— <i>He came from the sky and…</i>

341
00:24:04,028 --> 00:24:06,229
— <i>My girl.</i>

342
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,898
— My little girl.

343
00:24:07,949 --> 00:24:10,484
(sobbing)

344
00:24:12,987 --> 00:24:14,204
Daenerys: — <i>What was her name?</i>

345
00:24:14,238 --> 00:24:16,289
Missandei: — <i>Zala, Your Grace.</i>

346
00:24:16,324 --> 00:24:19,493
— How old was she?
— Three.

347
00:24:19,495 --> 00:24:21,661
— Three.

348
00:24:23,831 --> 00:24:26,500
—

349
00:24:28,443 --> 00:24:33,408
—

350
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:35,291

(screeching)

357
00:27:10,097 --> 00:27:14,217
Aemon: — <i> They came to us from
White Harbor and Barrowton,</i>

358
00:27:14,251 --> 00:27:17,971
— from Fairmarket and King’s Landing,

359
00:27:18,005 --> 00:27:20,507
— from north and south,

360
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:23,009
— from east and west.

361
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:28,231
— They died protecting men, women, and children

362
00:27:28,265 --> 00:27:30,850
— who will never know their names.

363
00:27:30,852 --> 00:27:33,436
— <i>It is for us to remember them.</i>

364
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:34,904
— <i>Our brothers,</i>

365
00:27:34,939 --> 00:27:38,108
— <i>we shall never see their like again.</i>

366
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,444
All: — And now their watch is ended.

367
00:27:41,495 --> 00:27:45,865
Aemon: — And now their watch is ended.

368
00:28:57,021 --> 00:29:00,323
— Your old blind man patched me up.

369
00:29:00,357 --> 00:29:01,941
— <i>Why?</i>

370
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:05,111
— He’s sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe.

371
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:07,530
— You want me alive so you can torture me?

372
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:08,832
— No one’s gonna torture you.

373
00:29:08,866 --> 00:29:12,685
— So how do we die? Hanging? Beheading?

374
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,671
— <i>Drop us from the top of the Wall?</i>

375
00:29:14,705 --> 00:29:16,840
— I don’t know what happens to the prisoners.

376
00:29:16,874 --> 00:29:18,792
— Who decides?

377
00:29:18,843 --> 00:29:21,344
— I suppose Stannis does.

378
00:29:21,378 --> 00:29:23,630
— He your king now?

379
00:29:23,632 --> 00:29:26,066
— I don’t have a king.

380
00:29:27,384 --> 00:29:30,603
— You spent too much time with us, Jon Snow.

381
00:29:31,722 --> 00:29:34,224
— You can never be a kneeler again.

382
00:29:34,275 --> 00:29:36,810
— We’re gonna burn the bodies of your dead.

383
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:40,363
— Do you want to say any words over them?

384
00:29:40,397 --> 00:29:42,782
— Words? What kind of words?

385
00:29:42,817 --> 00:29:46,119
— Funeral words. I don’t know how the free folk do it.

386
00:29:46,153 --> 00:29:47,737
— <i>Do what?</i>

387
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:49,489
— Say farewell.

388
00:29:49,523 --> 00:29:53,159
— The dead can’t hear us, boy.

389
00:29:58,332 --> 00:29:59,666
— Snow.

390
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:05,839
— Did you love her?

391
00:30:08,576 --> 00:30:10,660
— She loved you.

392
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,012
— She told you?

393
00:30:13,014 --> 00:30:14,264
— <i>No.</i>

394
00:30:14,315 --> 00:30:17,400
— All she ever talked about was killing you.

395
00:30:17,434 --> 00:30:19,686
— <i>That’s how I know.</i>

396
00:30:22,406 --> 00:30:24,908
— She belongs in the North.

397
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,894
— <i>The real North.</i>

398
00:30:29,196 --> 00:30:31,698
— You understand me?

399
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:54,697
<i>(wind howling)</i>

400
00:32:07,378 --> 00:32:10,096
(groaning)

401
00:32:16,687 --> 00:32:18,187
— We can stop. We can rest.

402
00:32:18,222 --> 00:32:20,290
— We’ll rest with the three-eyed raven.

403
00:32:31,068 --> 00:32:33,236
— We’re not going to make it.

404
00:32:37,574 --> 00:32:39,242
— We’re already here.

405
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:41,244
Bran: — <i>Jojen.</i>

406
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:44,163
— <i>Jojen.</i>

407
00:32:44,214 --> 00:32:46,416
— Look, Jojen. Look.

408
00:32:48,168 --> 00:32:50,470
(groaning)

409
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:10,249
— Jojen! Come on!

410
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:12,635
— Help them! Now!

411
00:34:12,669 --> 00:34:14,387
Meera: — <i>Hold on to me!</i>

412
00:34:19,009 --> 00:34:21,477
— Hang on!

413
00:34:21,512 --> 00:34:23,596
— Hodor.
— Help them!

414
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:25,515
— Hodor.

415
00:34:29,403 --> 00:34:31,738
— (growling)
— Hodor!

416
00:34:34,274 --> 00:34:36,692
— (screeching)

417
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:41,914
— (grunts)

418
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:47,837
— Hodor!

419
00:35:05,122 --> 00:35:08,141
— (growling)

420
00:35:08,143 --> 00:35:11,644
— Hodor. (whimpering)

421
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:13,613
— Hodor!

422
00:35:44,511 --> 00:35:47,146
Jojen: — <i>Bran!</i>

423
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,851
— Save yourself, now!

424
00:36:01,078 --> 00:36:03,362
— (grunting)

425
00:36:05,032 --> 00:36:07,166
— (shouts)

426
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,480
Girl: — <i> Come with me, Brandon Stark.</i>

427
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,468
— (gasping)

428
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:28,971
— He is lost.

429
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:30,890
— Come with me or die with him.

430
00:36:30,941 --> 00:36:33,643
— Go with them.

431
00:36:44,655 --> 00:36:47,540
— <i>(ice bursting)</i>

432
00:36:50,494 --> 00:36:52,578
— <i>(slices)</i>

433
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,463
— (growling)

434
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:38,691
— <i>They cannot follow us.</i>

435
00:37:38,725 --> 00:37:41,010
— The power that moves them is powerless here.

436
00:37:41,044 --> 00:37:43,379
— Who are you?

437
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,932
— The First Men called us the children,

438
00:37:45,966 --> 00:37:48,868
— but we were born long before them.

439
00:37:48,902 --> 00:37:51,437
— Come, he waits for you.

440
00:38:18,382 --> 00:38:20,633
— <i>(crow caws)</i>

441
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:04,510
— (caws)

442
00:39:15,972 --> 00:39:18,441
— You’re the three-eyed raven?

443
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:24,780
— I’ve been many things.

444
00:39:24,815 --> 00:39:28,401
— Now I am what you see.

445
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,322
— My brother, he led us to you and now he–

446
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:35,491
— He knew what would happen.

447
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:38,377
— From the moment he left,

448
00:39:38,412 --> 00:39:41,414
— he knew and he went anyway.

449
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:42,965
— How do you know?

450
00:39:42,999 --> 00:39:44,917
— I’ve been watching you.

451
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:47,219
— All of you.

452
00:39:47,254 --> 00:39:49,422
— All of your lives.

453
00:39:49,424 --> 00:39:52,091
— With 1,000 eyes and one.

454
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:56,729
— <i>Now you’ve come to me at last,</i>

455
00:39:56,763 --> 00:39:59,265
— Brandon Stark.

456
00:39:59,267 --> 00:40:01,767
— Though the hour is late.

457
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:04,987
— I didn’t want anyone to die for me.

458
00:40:05,021 --> 00:40:08,491
— He died so you could find what you have lost.

459
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:12,078
— You’re going to help me walk again?

460
00:40:13,246 --> 00:40:15,614
— <i>You will never walk again.</i>

461
00:40:17,367 --> 00:40:20,369
— But you will fly.

462
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:31,881
— <i>(bird squawks)</i>

463
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:38,020
— Podrick.

464
00:40:38,054 --> 00:40:40,139
— Podrick.

465
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,475
— Where are the horses?

466
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:45,394
— I hobbled them last night.

467
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:47,196
— What sort of hobble?

468
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,998
— A figure eight like you taught me.

469
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:51,367
— If you did it like I taught you,

470
00:40:51,401 --> 00:40:52,735
— then the horses would be here.

471
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:54,286
— Thieves, maybe?

472
00:40:54,321 --> 00:40:56,761
— It’s at least 30 miles to the Eyrie from here.

473
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,408
— You’re carrying the saddlebags.

474
00:41:11,087 --> 00:41:14,340
— <i>(grunting)</i>

475
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,771
— People coming.

476
00:41:30,524 --> 00:41:33,359
— You can shit later. There’s people coming.

477
00:41:35,846 --> 00:41:37,246
— Morning.

478
00:41:38,949 --> 00:41:41,083
— Morning.

479
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:44,436
— I like your sword.

480
00:41:44,471 --> 00:41:47,456
— <i>Are we getting close to the Bloody Gate?</i>

481
00:41:47,507 --> 00:41:49,458
— About 10 more miles.

482
00:41:49,509 --> 00:41:51,343
— Did you hear that, Podrick?

483
00:41:51,378 --> 00:41:53,929
— Only 10 more miles to the Bloody Gate.

484
00:41:55,465 --> 00:41:57,216
— Are you a knight?

485
00:41:57,218 --> 00:41:59,218
— No.

486
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,487
— But you know how to use that sword?

487
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:04,223
— I do.

488
00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:06,275
— Does it have a name?

489
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:08,644
— Oathkeeper.

490
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:10,446
— Mine’s Needle.

491
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,481
— Good name.

492
00:42:14,784 --> 00:42:16,402
— Who taught you how to fight?

493
00:42:16,404 --> 00:42:19,238
— My father.

494
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,324
— Mine never wanted to.

495
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:26,295
— Said fighting was for boys.

496
00:42:26,329 --> 00:42:28,330
— Mine said the same.

497
00:42:28,381 --> 00:42:30,583
— But I kept fighting the boys anyway.

498
00:42:30,634 --> 00:42:32,785
— <i>Kept losing.</i>

499
00:42:32,819 --> 00:42:35,421
— Finally my father said, «If you’re going to do it,

500
00:42:35,423 --> 00:42:37,256
— you might as well
do it right.»

501
00:42:41,344 --> 00:42:42,811
— Seven blessings.

502
00:42:42,846 --> 00:42:45,347
— I’m Brienne of Tarth. This is Podrick Payne.

503
00:42:47,868 --> 00:42:49,602
— You want something?

504
00:42:49,653 --> 00:42:52,938
— That’s Sandor Clegane. The Hound.

505
00:43:03,533 --> 00:43:06,035
— You’re Arya Stark.

506
00:43:06,069 --> 00:43:09,371
— I asked if you wanted something.

507
00:43:09,422 --> 00:43:11,991
— I swore to your mother I would bring you home to her.

508
00:43:13,226 --> 00:43:14,460
— My mother’s dead.

509
00:43:14,494 --> 00:43:16,061
— <i>I know.</i>

510
00:43:16,096 --> 00:43:19,214
— I wish I could have been there to protect her.

511
00:43:20,467 --> 00:43:21,934
— You’re not a northerner.

512
00:43:21,968 --> 00:43:25,804
— No, but I swore a sacred vow to protect her.

513
00:43:25,855 --> 00:43:27,890
— Why didn’t you?

514
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:34,480
— She commanded me to bring Jaime
Lannister back to King’s Landing.

515
00:43:34,531 --> 00:43:36,282
— You’re paid by the Lannisters.

516
00:43:36,316 --> 00:43:38,951
— <i>You’re here for the bounty on me.</i>

517
00:43:38,985 --> 00:43:41,704
— I’m not paid by the Lannisters.

518
00:43:41,738 --> 00:43:43,572
— No?

519
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:46,742
— Fancy sword you’ve got there.

520
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:48,577
— Where’d you get it?

521
00:43:51,247 --> 00:43:54,527
— I’ve been looking at Lannister gold all my life.

522
00:43:55,802 --> 00:43:58,170
— Go on, Brienne of fucking Tarth.

523
00:43:58,221 --> 00:44:00,839
— Tell me that’s not Lannister gold.

524
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:04,893
— Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.

525
00:44:04,928 --> 00:44:06,729
— The Bloody Gate is 10 miles.

526
00:44:06,763 --> 00:44:08,564
— I swore to your mother by the old gods–

527
00:44:08,598 --> 00:44:09,848
— I don’t care what you swore.

528
00:44:09,899 --> 00:44:11,600
— Arya!
Hound: — <i>You heard the girl.</i>

529
00:44:11,651 --> 00:44:14,603
— She’s not coming with you.
— She is.

530
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:18,574
— You’re not a good listener.

531
00:44:18,608 --> 00:44:20,693
— That Valyrian steel?

532
00:44:20,695 --> 00:44:22,778
— I always wanted some Valyrian steel.

533
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:25,664
— Come with me, Arya. I’ll take you to safety.

534
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:28,167
— Safety? Where the fuck’s that?

535
00:44:28,201 --> 00:44:30,769
— Her aunt in the Eyrie is dead. Her mother’s dead.

536
00:44:30,804 --> 00:44:32,788
— Her father’s dead. Her brother’s dead.

537
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:34,957
— Winterfell is a pile of rubble.

538
00:44:35,008 --> 00:44:37,343
— There is no safety, you dumb bitch.

539
00:44:38,628 --> 00:44:40,129
— You don’t know that by now,

540
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,765
— you’re the wrong one to watch over her.

541
00:44:42,799 --> 00:44:44,767
— And that’s what you’re doing?

542
00:44:44,801 --> 00:44:46,885
— Watching over her?

543
00:44:46,936 --> 00:44:49,855
— Aye, that’s what I’m doing.

544
00:45:04,237 --> 00:45:06,705
— (grunts)

545
00:45:11,077 --> 00:45:12,828
— (panting)

546
00:45:33,099 --> 00:45:34,983
— (grunts)

547
00:45:57,674 --> 00:46:00,175
— I have no wish to kill you, Ser.

548
00:46:13,473 --> 00:46:15,190
— I’m not a knight.

549
00:46:15,225 --> 00:46:17,142
— (grunts)

550
00:46:18,778 --> 00:46:20,562
— (groans)

551
00:46:25,485 --> 00:46:27,319
— (screams)

552
00:46:35,745 --> 00:46:38,213
— (screaming)

553
00:46:38,248 --> 00:46:40,783
— (groans)

554
00:47:05,642 --> 00:47:08,694
— (shouting)

555
00:47:32,336 --> 00:47:34,454
— Arya!

556
00:47:34,538 --> 00:47:36,706
— Arya!

557
00:47:37,875 --> 00:47:39,809
— Arya!

558
00:47:41,212 --> 00:47:43,213
— Where is she?
Podrick: — <i>She was just here.</i>

559
00:47:43,215 --> 00:47:44,631
— Why weren’t you watching her?

560
00:47:44,682 --> 00:47:46,843
— I was watching you. I thought you might need some help.

561
00:47:46,851 --> 00:47:48,768
— Which way, Pod? Which way did she go?

562
00:47:48,802 --> 00:47:50,637
— I think that way.

563
00:47:50,688 --> 00:47:52,555
Brienne: — <i>Arya!</i>

564
00:47:52,606 --> 00:47:54,691
— <i>Arya!</i>

565
00:48:17,381 --> 00:48:19,666
— (panting)

566
00:48:23,304 --> 00:48:25,421
— You still here?

567
00:48:27,341 --> 00:48:29,259
— (coughs)

568
00:48:35,816 --> 00:48:37,400
— Big bitch saved you.

569
00:48:37,434 --> 00:48:39,569
— I don’t need saving.

570
00:48:39,603 --> 00:48:42,322
— No, not you. You’re a real killer.

571
00:48:42,356 --> 00:48:44,574
— With your water dancing

572
00:48:44,608 --> 00:48:46,609
— and your Needle.

573
00:48:47,945 --> 00:48:49,746
— You gonna die?

574
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:52,532
— Unless there’s a maester hiding behind that rock,

575
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:54,667
— aye,

576
00:48:54,702 --> 00:48:57,120
— I’m done.

577
00:49:00,841 --> 00:49:03,760
— I’d skin you alive for wine.

578
00:49:04,712 --> 00:49:06,846
— Fuck water.

579
00:49:08,215 --> 00:49:10,383
— Killed by a woman.

580
00:49:10,434 --> 00:49:12,135
— (chuckles)

581
00:49:12,186 --> 00:49:14,771
— I bet you like that.

582
00:49:16,523 --> 00:49:18,358
— Go on,

583
00:49:18,392 --> 00:49:20,443
— go after her.

584
00:49:20,477 --> 00:49:22,946
— <i>She’ll help you.</i>

585
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:28,284
— Going it alone,

586
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,820
— <i>you won’t last a day out there.</i>

587
00:49:30,822 --> 00:49:33,740
— I’ll last longer than you.

588
00:49:40,414 --> 00:49:43,082
— You remember where the heart is?

589
00:49:50,507 --> 00:49:52,175
— Fuck it.

590
00:49:52,226 --> 00:49:54,060
— I’m ready.

591
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:58,648
— Go on, girl.

592
00:49:58,682 --> 00:50:00,900
— Another name off your list.

593
00:50:02,069 --> 00:50:04,237
— You kept promising me.

594
00:50:10,361 --> 00:50:12,862
— I cut down your butcher’s boy.

595
00:50:12,864 --> 00:50:14,781
— The ginger.

596
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,534
— He was begging for mercy.

597
00:50:18,585 --> 00:50:21,871
— «Please, Ser. Please don’t kill me.

598
00:50:21,922 --> 00:50:23,873
— Please, please.»

599
00:50:25,426 --> 00:50:27,877
— <i>Bled all over my horse.</i>

600
00:50:27,928 --> 00:50:31,014
— <i>Saddle stunk of butcher’s
boy for weeks.</i>

601
00:50:33,684 --> 00:50:35,468
— And your sister.

602
00:50:36,804 --> 00:50:38,888
— Your pretty sister.

603
00:50:40,107 --> 00:50:42,692
— <i>I should have taken her.</i>

604
00:50:42,726 --> 00:50:45,478
— That night the Blackwater burned.

605
00:50:47,064 --> 00:50:49,232
— I should have fucked her bloody.

606
00:50:50,651 --> 00:50:53,286
— <i>At least I’d have one happy memory.</i>

607
00:51:03,247 --> 00:51:05,415
— Do I have to beg you?

608
00:51:10,054 --> 00:51:12,004
— Do it.

609
00:51:16,677 --> 00:51:18,644
— Do it.

610
00:51:21,815 --> 00:51:23,683
— Do it.

611
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,598
— Kill me.

612
00:51:58,769 --> 00:52:01,270
— Kill me!

613
00:52:02,606 --> 00:52:05,141
— Kill me!

614
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:07,810
— Kill me!

615
00:52:07,861 --> 00:52:10,313
— <i>(door opens)</i>

616
00:52:12,649 --> 00:52:14,734
— <i>(door closes)</i>

617
00:52:14,785 --> 00:52:16,903
— <i>(footsteps)</i>

618
00:52:18,122 --> 00:52:20,790
— Oh, get on with it, you son of a whore.

619
00:52:20,824 --> 00:52:22,992
— Is that any way to speak about our mother?

620
00:52:23,043 --> 00:52:24,961
— What are you doing?

621
00:52:24,995 --> 00:52:26,662
— What do you think I’m doing?

622
00:52:26,713 --> 00:52:28,714
— A galley’s waiting in the bay bound for the Free Cities.

623
00:52:28,749 --> 00:52:30,049
— Who’s helping you?
— Varys.

624
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:32,443
— Varys?
– You have more friends than you thought.

625
00:52:44,181 --> 00:52:45,681
— There’s a locked door at the top of the stairs.

626
00:52:45,683 --> 00:52:48,351
— Knock on it twice, then twice again.

627
00:52:49,486 --> 00:52:51,270
— Varys will open.

628
00:52:51,321 --> 00:52:54,190
— I suppose this is good-bye, then.

629
00:53:09,256 --> 00:53:11,374
— Farewell, little brother.

630
00:53:12,843 --> 00:53:16,128
— Jaime.

631
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:19,098
— Thank you for my life.

632
00:53:21,718 --> 00:53:23,719
— Quickly now.

633
00:54:43,226 --> 00:54:45,294
— Tywin?

634
00:54:47,831 --> 00:54:50,166
— My lion.

635
00:55:02,763 --> 00:55:04,847
— (grunting)

636
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:25,701
— (choking)

637
00:55:27,537 --> 00:55:29,004
— (grunts)

638
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:31,924
— (gasping)

639
00:55:36,713 --> 00:55:39,882
— (whimpers)

640
00:56:08,462 --> 00:56:10,913
— I’m sorry.

641
00:56:20,674 --> 00:56:23,426
— (exhales)

642
00:56:23,428 --> 00:56:25,261
— I’m sorry.

643
00:56:38,408 --> 00:56:40,075
— <i>(crossbow lever dragging)</i>

644
00:57:06,803 --> 00:57:09,305
— (door creaks)

645
00:57:12,108 --> 00:57:14,026
— Tyrion.

646
00:57:15,195 --> 00:57:16,979
— Put down the crossbow.

647
00:57:20,617 --> 00:57:22,902
— Who released you?

648
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:25,321
— Your brother, I expect.

649
00:57:25,372 --> 00:57:27,656
— He always had a soft spot for you.

650
00:57:28,825 --> 00:57:31,494
— Come, we’ll go and talk in my chambers.

651
00:57:35,916 --> 00:57:38,884
— This is how you want to speak to me, hmm?

652
00:57:38,919 --> 00:57:41,387
— <i>Shaming your father has always given you pleasure.</i>

653
00:57:41,421 --> 00:57:43,172
— All my life

654
00:57:43,223 --> 00:57:45,758
— you’ve wanted me dead.

655
00:57:47,477 --> 00:57:49,512
— Yes.

656
00:57:49,514 --> 00:57:52,181
— <i>But you refused to die.</i>

657
00:57:52,232 --> 00:57:54,016
— I respect that.

658
00:57:54,018 --> 00:57:55,901
— Even admire it.

659
00:57:55,936 --> 00:57:57,937
— <i>You fight for what’s yours.</i>

660
00:57:57,988 --> 00:58:00,356
— I’d never let them execute you.

661
00:58:00,407 --> 00:58:01,690
— Is that what you fear?

662
00:58:01,741 --> 00:58:04,577
— <i>I’ll never let Ilyn Payne take your head.</i>

663
00:58:04,611 --> 00:58:06,695
— You’re a Lannister.

664
00:58:08,665 --> 00:58:11,700
— You’re my son.

665
00:58:13,203 --> 00:58:14,837
— I loved her.

666
00:58:14,871 --> 00:58:16,872
— Who?

667
00:58:16,874 --> 00:58:19,291
— Shae.

668
00:58:19,342 --> 00:58:21,377
— Oh, Tyrion.

669
00:58:22,629 --> 00:58:25,130
— Put down that crossbow.
— I murdered her.

670
00:58:27,551 --> 00:58:29,418
— With my own hands.

671
00:58:32,606 --> 00:58:35,858
— It doesn’t matter.
— Doesn’t matter?

672
00:58:35,892 --> 00:58:38,477
— She was a whore.

673
00:58:39,779 --> 00:58:41,697
— Say that word again…
— <i>And what?</i>

674
00:58:41,731 --> 00:58:44,149
— You’ll kill your own father in the privy?

675
00:58:45,485 --> 00:58:47,453
— No.

676
00:58:47,487 --> 00:58:49,738
— You’re my son.

677
00:58:49,789 --> 00:58:51,490
— Now, enough of this nonsense.

678
00:58:51,541 --> 00:58:54,793
— I am your son and you sentenced me to die.

679
00:58:54,828 --> 00:58:58,247
— You knew I didn’t poison Joffrey,

680
00:58:58,298 --> 00:59:01,584
— but you sentenced me all the same.

681
00:59:01,586 --> 00:59:04,219
— Why?
— Enough.

682
00:59:04,254 --> 00:59:05,804
— <i>We’ll go back to my chambers</i>

683
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:07,256
— and speak with some dignity.

684
00:59:07,258 --> 00:59:10,092
— I can’t go back there. She’s in there.

685
00:59:10,143 --> 00:59:12,183
— You’re afraid of a dead whore?

686
00:59:13,313 --> 00:59:15,347
— (groans)

687
00:59:24,074 --> 00:59:25,941
— You shot me.

688
00:59:31,164 --> 00:59:33,282
— (groans)

689
00:59:34,868 --> 00:59:37,119
— You’re no son of mine.

690
00:59:37,121 --> 00:59:38,704
— I am your son.

691
00:59:39,789 --> 00:59:43,092
— I have always been your son.

692
00:59:43,126 --> 00:59:45,044
— (groans)

693
00:59:57,023 --> 00:59:59,391
— What have you done?

694
01:00:00,527 --> 01:00:02,645
— Quickly.

695
01:00:05,949 --> 01:00:08,651
— Trust me, my friend. I brought you this far.

696
01:00:39,482 --> 01:00:42,351
— <i>(bells tolling)</i>

697
01:02:03,566 --> 01:02:05,400
— I want to see the captain.

698
01:02:05,435 --> 01:02:07,102
— You’re seeing him.

699
01:02:07,104 --> 01:02:09,655
— I want to go north to the Wall.

700
01:02:09,689 --> 01:02:11,857
— No, you don’t.

701
01:02:12,859 --> 01:02:14,193
— I can pay.

702
01:02:14,244 --> 01:02:17,696
— There is nothing in the North
but ice and war and pirates.

703
01:02:17,747 --> 01:02:20,032
— I wouldn’t need a cabin. Please.

704
01:02:20,083 --> 01:02:22,334
— I could work scrubbing the floors.

705
01:02:22,368 --> 01:02:25,087
— I’m not going north, child. I’m going home.

706
01:02:25,121 --> 01:02:28,507
— Where’s home?
— The Free City of Braavos.

707
01:02:29,509 --> 01:02:31,126
— Wait. I have something else.

708
01:02:31,177 --> 01:02:32,878
— More silver won’t make a difference.

709
01:02:32,929 --> 01:02:38,300
— It’s not silver. It’s iron.

710
01:02:38,351 --> 01:02:40,302
— This…

711
01:02:44,357 --> 01:02:45,641
— How did you–
