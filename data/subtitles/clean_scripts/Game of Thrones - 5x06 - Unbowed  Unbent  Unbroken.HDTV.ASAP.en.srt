1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:03,738
My son, Jorah, fled Westeros.

2
00:00:03,858 --> 00:00:05,919
He brought dishonor to our house.

3
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:10,561
I need to turn this bunch of thieves and
runaways into men of the Night's Watch.

4
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:12,368
And how's this going, Commander Mormont?

5
00:00:13,512 --> 00:00:15,381
I shall have your head!

6
00:00:18,407 --> 00:00:20,077
You're taking us through Valyria.

7
00:00:20,426 --> 00:00:22,594
The Doom still rules Valyria.

8
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:27,545
Stone Men!

9
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:32,381
Had any touch you?

10
00:00:33,316 --> 00:00:34,375
You?

11
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:39,422
The Eyrie is mine.

12
00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:43,933
The last time the Lords of the Eyrie formed
an alliance with the Lords of the North,

13
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:46,861
they brought down the greatest
dynasty this world has ever known.

14
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:50,612
Cersei sent for me.

15
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:53,561
I expect I'll be a married
woman by the time you return.

16
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:55,492
I hope I can make her happy.

17
00:00:55,612 --> 00:00:56,664
She suffered enough.

18
00:00:56,784 --> 00:00:58,446
I'll never hurt her!

19
00:00:58,873 --> 00:01:01,209
All sinners are equal before the Gods.

20
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:05,290
What would you say if I told you
of a great sinner in our very midst?

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,996
May the Father judge him justly.

22
00:01:08,116 --> 00:01:10,313
- Who do you think you are?
- Justice.

23
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:15,122
Your brother was murdered,
while you sit here, doing nothing.

24
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,475
The Sand Snakes are with me.

25
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:19,646
Without Doran we have no army
to march against the Lannisters.

26
00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:22,337
Queen Cersei loves her children.

27
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,692
And we have one of them.

28
00:01:23,812 --> 00:01:26,347
We rescue my niece,
bring her back to the family.

29
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:27,842
You ever been to Dorne?

30
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:32,592
The Dornish are crazy.

31
00:01:32,712 --> 00:01:36,261
If he gets to her before we do, we
lose our only chance for revenge.

32
00:01:38,309 --> 00:01:40,443
Here we serve the Many-Faced God.

33
00:01:40,563 --> 00:01:42,966
To serve well, a girl must become no one.

34
00:01:43,214 --> 00:01:45,239
What do we with them after you wash them?

35
00:03:27,348 --> 00:03:37,775


36
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,241
What are they doing
with the bodies?

37
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:43,437
Get back to work.

38
00:05:43,897 --> 00:05:46,515
No. I've been here
for weeks.

39
00:05:46,517 --> 00:05:48,017
I'm not scrubbing
one more corpse

40
00:05:48,068 --> 00:05:50,586
until you tell me
why I'm doing it.

41
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,521
You will know why.

42
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:56,826
- When?
- When it's time, not before.

43
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,327
Get back to work.

44
00:05:58,361 --> 00:05:59,829
When do I get to play the game?

45
00:05:59,863 --> 00:06:01,497
Game?

46
00:06:01,531 --> 00:06:04,116
The game.
The Game of Faces.

47
00:06:04,151 --> 00:06:07,536
You tried already.
You failed.

48
00:06:07,587 --> 00:06:09,004
I didn't even know
I was playing.

49
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,423
Who are you?

50
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,108
No one.

51
00:06:14,377 --> 00:06:15,628
Get back to work.

52
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:17,129
Who are you?

53
00:06:17,214 --> 00:06:20,382
What are you doing here?
How did you get here?

54
00:06:21,601 --> 00:06:24,954
I'm from Westeros just like you.

55
00:06:26,156 --> 00:06:28,707
Daughter of a lord
just like you.

56
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,544
Except I was an only child.

57
00:06:31,578 --> 00:06:34,797
Heir to his fortune.

58
00:06:34,831 --> 00:06:37,399
My mother died.

59
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:39,652
My father remarried
and his new wife

60
00:06:39,736 --> 00:06:42,555
gave birth to a girl.

61
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:47,142
My stepmother didn't want any
rivals for her precious daughter,

62
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,211
so she tried
to kill me with poison.

63
00:06:49,246 --> 00:06:51,480
I found out.

64
00:06:51,515 --> 00:06:53,749
Sought help from
the Faceless Men.

65
00:06:55,952 --> 00:06:58,637
And my father was widowed again.

66
00:07:00,307 --> 00:07:02,675
I've been serving them
ever since.

67
00:07:13,887 --> 00:07:17,172
Was that true or a lie?

68
00:07:19,876 --> 00:07:21,327
What?

69
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:23,162
Did you believe
every word I said?

70
00:07:28,001 --> 00:07:29,585
Get back to work.

71
00:07:44,184 --> 00:07:46,235
<i>Who are you?

72
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,813
Who are you?

73
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:04,236
Arya.

74
00:08:05,405 --> 00:08:07,539
And where did you come from?

75
00:08:07,624 --> 00:08:09,041
<i>Westeros.

76
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:15,164
My family home is Winterfell.

77
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,800
I'm the youngest daughter
of a great lord,

78
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:19,034
Eddard Stark.

79
00:08:19,085 --> 00:08:20,669
He died in battle.

80
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:23,339
A lie.

81
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,442
After he was executed,
I fled the capital.

82
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:29,678
Had to kill a stable boy.

83
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:31,513
Drove my sword through his back.

84
00:08:33,016 --> 00:08:34,650
A lie.

85
00:08:34,684 --> 00:08:36,602
I stabbed him in the gut.

86
00:08:36,636 --> 00:08:39,171
<i>I tried to find</i>
<i>my mother and brother,

87
00:08:39,205 --> 00:08:40,839
<i>but I never did.

88
00:08:40,907 --> 00:08:43,275
<i>They were murdered</i>
<i>by Walder Frey.

89
00:08:44,694 --> 00:08:46,912
An outlaw kidnapped me,
a man called Polliver.

90
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:52,368
A man called the Hound.
Sandor Clegane.

91
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,503
He tried to sell me,
but was wounded in a fight.

92
00:08:54,537 --> 00:08:56,538
He begged me to kill him,
but I wouldn't.

93
00:08:56,573 --> 00:08:58,674
I left him
in the mountains to die.

94
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:01,176
I wanted him to suffer.
I hated him.

95
00:09:03,296 --> 00:09:04,763
I hated him.

96
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:09,218
That's not a lie!

97
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,221
A girl lies to me,

98
00:09:12,272 --> 00:09:15,724
to the Many-Faced God,
to herself.

99
00:09:15,726 --> 00:09:17,910
Does she truly
want to be no one?

100
00:09:17,978 --> 00:09:20,145
Yes.

101
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:28,153
I'm not playing
this stupid game anymore!

102
00:09:28,204 --> 00:09:30,372
We never stop playing.

103
00:09:52,645 --> 00:09:56,265
So, those villages
we were supposed to find?

104
00:09:56,316 --> 00:09:58,150
We can't live on
berries and roots.

105
00:09:58,184 --> 00:10:00,903
I can.

106
00:10:00,937 --> 00:10:02,738
You're not hungry?

107
00:10:02,772 --> 00:10:05,024
Of course I'm hungry.

108
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:07,609
You're an awful travelling
companion, do you know that?

109
00:10:07,611 --> 00:10:09,862
Possibly the least
charming man I've ever met.

110
00:10:09,913 --> 00:10:11,547
I'm not your travelling
companion.

111
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:14,867
We are travelling together in
each other's company, therefore--

112
00:10:14,951 --> 00:10:16,785
Do you ever shut up?

113
00:10:16,836 --> 00:10:19,955
I sailed from King's Landing
to Pentos in a crate

114
00:10:20,006 --> 00:10:22,458
<i>without ever saying a word.

115
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:24,209
Why?

116
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:30,299
It never occurred to you
to ask why until now?

117
00:10:32,635 --> 00:10:34,603
You never wondered
why Tyrion Lannister

118
00:10:34,637 --> 00:10:37,306
decided to visit
a brothel in Volantis?

119
00:10:37,357 --> 00:10:40,309
I'm sure you visited many
brothels in many cities.

120
00:10:42,445 --> 00:10:44,146
I killed my father.

121
00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:50,035
He wanted to execute me
for a crime I didn't commit.

122
00:10:52,655 --> 00:10:54,907
And he was fucking
the woman I loved.

123
00:11:05,552 --> 00:11:07,102
As miserable
as you are, Mormont,

124
00:11:07,137 --> 00:11:08,670
at least your father
was a good man.

125
00:11:08,672 --> 00:11:10,506
What do you know
about my father?

126
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,093
I met him.
I visited the Wall.

127
00:11:14,144 --> 00:11:17,062
When I asked him about his men,

128
00:11:17,097 --> 00:11:19,338
he knew all their stories,
every one of them.

129
00:11:19,349 --> 00:11:22,935
He actually cared about the
people under his command.

130
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:26,355
How do they put it in the Watch?

131
00:11:26,406 --> 00:11:29,158
"We shall never see
his like again."

132
00:11:38,835 --> 00:11:42,337
Oh, you didn't know.

133
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:50,712
I'm sorry.
I am.

134
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:54,550
How?

135
00:11:56,052 --> 00:11:57,886
I only know what I heard.

136
00:11:57,937 --> 00:11:59,104
How?

137
00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:01,723
<i>He was leading an
expedition beyond the Wall.

138
00:12:02,642 --> 00:12:05,310
There was a mutiny.

139
00:12:05,361 --> 00:12:07,629
He was murdered by his own men.

140
00:12:19,242 --> 00:12:21,493
We better keep moving.

141
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,511
Valar morghulis.

142
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:14,646
Valar dohaeris.

143
00:13:16,082 --> 00:13:18,383
I have nowhere else to go.

144
00:13:18,418 --> 00:13:22,087
I've taken her to every
healer in Braavos.

145
00:13:22,121 --> 00:13:25,123
I've spent every penny I had.

146
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,265
She suffers every day
of her life.

147
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:36,285
I just want it to end.

148
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,847
It hurts.

149
00:14:05,898 --> 00:14:08,267
I know.

150
00:14:10,403 --> 00:14:12,854
Don't be afraid.

151
00:14:12,905 --> 00:14:16,308
I used to be like you.

152
00:14:16,342 --> 00:14:18,477
I was sick.

153
00:14:19,746 --> 00:14:21,747
I was dying.

154
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,287
But my father
never gave up on me.

155
00:14:30,707 --> 00:14:33,492
He loved me

156
00:14:33,526 --> 00:14:35,127
more than anything in the world,

157
00:14:35,178 --> 00:14:37,913
just like your father loves you.

158
00:14:37,947 --> 00:14:41,199
So he brought me here.

159
00:14:41,234 --> 00:14:43,885
My father prayed
to the Many-Faced God.

160
00:14:46,022 --> 00:14:48,223
And I drank the water
from his fountain.

161
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:51,293
It healed me.

162
00:15:03,906 --> 00:15:06,491
I've devoted my life to him now.

163
00:15:08,011 --> 00:15:10,172
You don't want to hurt anymore?

164
00:15:12,265 --> 00:15:13,965
Drink.

165
00:17:58,297 --> 00:18:00,248
<i>Is a girl ready?

166
00:18:01,918 --> 00:18:04,803
To give up her ears,
her nose, her tongue?

167
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:09,257
<i>Her hopes and dreams,</i>
<i>her loves and hates?

168
00:18:09,308 --> 00:18:12,093
All that makes a girl
who she is?

169
00:18:13,229 --> 00:18:15,397
Forever?

170
00:18:18,518 --> 00:18:20,936
No.

171
00:18:20,938 --> 00:18:24,105
A girl is not ready
to become no one.

172
00:18:29,595 --> 00:18:32,264
But she is ready
to become someone else.

173
00:18:45,545 --> 00:18:48,597
Why Daenerys? Why is
she worth all this?

174
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:53,435
As I recall, the Mormonts
fought against the Targaryens

175
00:18:53,469 --> 00:18:55,353
during Robert's Rebellion.

176
00:18:55,388 --> 00:18:57,522
Do you believe in anything?

177
00:18:57,557 --> 00:18:59,224
I believe in lots of things.

178
00:18:59,308 --> 00:19:01,192
In something greater
than ourselves, I mean.

179
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:03,311
The gods, destiny.

180
00:19:03,362 --> 00:19:06,565
Do you believe there's
a plan for this world?

181
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:09,067
No.

182
00:19:09,118 --> 00:19:10,368
Neither did I.

183
00:19:10,403 --> 00:19:12,787
I was a cynic just like you.

184
00:19:12,822 --> 00:19:15,957
Then I saw a girl
step into a great fire

185
00:19:15,992 --> 00:19:17,876
with three stone eggs.

186
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,712
When the fire burned out, I thought
I'd find her blackened bones.

187
00:19:20,746 --> 00:19:24,833
Instead, I saw her, Daenerys,

188
00:19:24,884 --> 00:19:28,887
alive and unhurt,
holding her baby dragons.

189
00:19:31,223 --> 00:19:34,009
Have you ever heard
baby dragons singing?

190
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,760
No.

191
00:19:35,811 --> 00:19:38,263
It's hard to be
a cynic after that.

192
00:19:40,182 --> 00:19:42,434
Doesn't mean she's going
to be a great queen.

193
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:44,352
<i>No, it doesn't.

194
00:19:44,403 --> 00:19:46,688
The Targaryens
are famously insane.

195
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,608
What if she conquers the world?
Then what?

196
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:51,910
1,000 years of peace
and prosperity?

197
00:19:51,944 --> 00:19:53,945
First we have
to conquer the world.

198
00:19:53,996 --> 00:19:55,864
We?

199
00:19:55,866 --> 00:19:58,083
All right, let's assume
your dreams come true.

200
00:19:58,167 --> 00:20:01,453
<i>She's ecstatic when you</i>
<i>bring her this enemy dwarf.

201
00:20:01,504 --> 00:20:04,673
<i>She hacks off my head</i>
<i>and restores your position.

202
00:20:04,707 --> 00:20:07,008
You command her army,
sail to Westeros,

203
00:20:07,043 --> 00:20:09,961
defeat all your enemies and
watch her climb those steps

204
00:20:10,012 --> 00:20:11,463
and sit on the Iron Throne.

205
00:20:11,514 --> 00:20:13,765
Hurrah. Long live the queen.
Then what?

206
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,383
Then she rules.

207
00:20:15,434 --> 00:20:18,603
So a woman who has not spent a
single day of her adult life

208
00:20:18,638 --> 00:20:21,356
in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros?
That's justice?

209
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,942
- She's the rightful heir.
- Why?

210
00:20:23,976 --> 00:20:27,812
Because her father, who burned living
men for amusement, was the king?

211
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,485
- That's a slave ship.
- Why are they anchored?

212
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:35,320
They probably
came ashore for--

213
00:20:35,371 --> 00:20:37,822
<i>Water.

214
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:51,169
Got a lot of fight in you, huh?

215
00:20:59,428 --> 00:21:01,479
Salt mines?

216
00:21:01,564 --> 00:21:04,816
Yeah, that or a galley slave.

217
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,735
<i>He looks strong enough.

218
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:09,571
What about the dwarf?

219
00:21:09,605 --> 00:21:11,906
Worthless.

220
00:21:11,941 --> 00:21:14,526
Cut his throat.

221
00:21:14,577 --> 00:21:16,578
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait!
Let's discuss this.

222
00:21:16,612 --> 00:21:19,030
And then chop off his cock.

223
00:21:19,115 --> 00:21:20,281
We'll sell it for a fortune.

224
00:21:20,332 --> 00:21:22,450
A dwarf's cock has magic powers.

225
00:21:22,501 --> 00:21:24,869
Wait! Wait!

226
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,287
Wait, wait, wait!

227
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:28,923
You can't just hand
a dry cock to a merchant

228
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,458
and expect him to pay for it.

229
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,460
He has to know
it came from a dwarf.

230
00:21:32,511 --> 00:21:35,814
And how could he know
unless he sees the dwarf?

231
00:21:35,848 --> 00:21:37,599
It will be
a dwarf-sized cock.

232
00:21:37,633 --> 00:21:39,634
Guess again.

233
00:21:44,473 --> 00:21:47,559
The dwarf lives until we
find a cock merchant.

234
00:21:56,235 --> 00:21:58,737
Queen Daenerys
has outlawed slavery.

235
00:21:58,788 --> 00:22:01,823
We're bound for Volantis,
not Slaver's Bay.

236
00:22:01,825 --> 00:22:05,543
Besides, she reopened
the fighting pits.

237
00:22:05,578 --> 00:22:08,246
I've never heard of free men
fighting in the pits.

238
00:22:08,297 --> 00:22:10,498
<i>The fighting pits in Meereen?

239
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,501
You're in luck, then.
You're about to be rich.

240
00:22:13,503 --> 00:22:17,472
You are looking at one of the great
warriors in the Seven Kingdoms.

241
00:22:19,175 --> 00:22:20,759
Him.

242
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:24,729
Him? He's got to
be 60 years old.

243
00:22:24,764 --> 00:22:27,482
Sure, he's a bit
long in the tooth,

244
00:22:27,516 --> 00:22:30,318
a bit withered,
been in the sun too long.

245
00:22:30,352 --> 00:22:33,822
We can all see that. But he
is a veteran of 100 battles.

246
00:22:33,856 --> 00:22:36,157
They wrote songs about him.

247
00:22:42,331 --> 00:22:44,082
That true?

248
00:22:49,371 --> 00:22:52,257
He won the tournament
at Lannisport.

249
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:54,926
Unseating Ser Jaime
Lannister himself.

250
00:22:56,178 --> 00:22:59,214
The Kingslayer.

251
00:22:59,216 --> 00:23:02,634
Jousting. You're talking
about jousting.

252
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:05,019
A fancy game for fancy lads.

253
00:23:05,054 --> 00:23:07,806
The men who fight in the pits of
Meereen will swallow him whole.

254
00:23:07,857 --> 00:23:10,897
I killed a Dothraki
bloodrider in single combat.

255
00:23:21,403 --> 00:23:22,821
Liar.

256
00:23:22,872 --> 00:23:25,540
It's no lie.
His name was Qotho.

257
00:23:25,574 --> 00:23:28,459
He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo.

258
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:32,463
Take me to Slaver's Bay,
put a sword in my hand,

259
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:34,132
I'll prove my worth.

260
00:23:45,845 --> 00:23:49,063
For my children.
Money.

261
00:23:52,685 --> 00:23:54,736
Lord Baelish.

262
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,905
Yes?

263
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,275
Lancel Lannister.

264
00:24:02,444 --> 00:24:04,412
Brother Lancel.

265
00:24:04,446 --> 00:24:06,030
We abandon our family names.

266
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:07,866
Quite a family to abandon.

267
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:11,085
The city has changed
since you were here last.

268
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,004
We flooded the gutters
with wine,

269
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:15,506
smashed the false idols,

270
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:18,042
and set the godless on the run.

271
00:24:18,093 --> 00:24:19,594
Well done.

272
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:28,269
I'm here on urgent business
for the Queen Mother.

273
00:24:28,304 --> 00:24:31,272
Should I send word
that I'll be delayed?

274
00:24:35,027 --> 00:24:36,694
Step carefully, Lord Baelish.

275
00:24:36,729 --> 00:24:39,147
You'll find there's little
tolerance for flesh peddlers

276
00:24:39,198 --> 00:24:40,732
in the new King's Landing.

277
00:24:40,783 --> 00:24:43,618
We both peddle fantasies,
Brother Lancel.

278
00:24:43,652 --> 00:24:46,154
Mine just happen
to be entertaining.

279
00:24:55,464 --> 00:24:58,800
Do you think it's wise,
Your Grace,

280
00:24:58,834 --> 00:25:00,635
arresting the heir
to Highgarden?

281
00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:03,504
The Faith arrested
the heir to Highgarden.

282
00:25:03,506 --> 00:25:06,667
Of course, and the Faith
were armed on your orders.

283
00:25:06,675 --> 00:25:08,476
The king's orders.

284
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,595
Is the king to blame
for Ser Loras's perversion?

285
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:12,547
House Tyrell won't
tolerate this insult.

286
00:25:12,581 --> 00:25:15,683
House Tyrell won't tolerate it?

287
00:25:15,734 --> 00:25:17,685
I'm the insulted party,
Lord Baelish.

288
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,554
Ser Loras was promised to me.

289
00:25:19,588 --> 00:25:21,572
Instead he chose
the company of boys.

290
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:23,927
One's choice of companion
is a curious thing.

291
00:25:26,629 --> 00:25:28,196
Most curious.

292
00:25:30,366 --> 00:25:32,533
Lysa Arryn, for instance.

293
00:25:32,535 --> 00:25:34,569
Thoroughly repellant woman.

294
00:25:35,971 --> 00:25:37,922
Forgive me.

295
00:25:37,957 --> 00:25:39,924
I know you're still in mourning.

296
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:43,344
Lysa was a good woman.

297
00:25:43,379 --> 00:25:44,679
A kind woman.

298
00:25:44,713 --> 00:25:47,682
<i>She was neither of those things.
We both know it.

299
00:25:47,716 --> 00:25:49,717
Still, I pity her son.

300
00:25:49,752 --> 00:25:52,020
How fortunate the young
Lord of the Vale

301
00:25:52,054 --> 00:25:54,355
<i>has a new father to counsel him.

302
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,391
I know how hard it can be

303
00:25:56,393 --> 00:25:59,227
to lose both your parents
at such a young age.

304
00:25:59,229 --> 00:26:02,229
If war comes to Westeros, will the Knights
of the Vale fight for their king?

305
00:26:03,315 --> 00:26:05,650
Young Lord Robin
heeds my advice.

306
00:26:07,202 --> 00:26:09,604
And I have always counseled
loyalty to the throne.

307
00:26:09,638 --> 00:26:11,439
Good.

308
00:26:15,744 --> 00:26:17,628
If there's nothing else.

309
00:26:18,747 --> 00:26:20,581
There is another matter,
Your Grace.

310
00:26:20,632 --> 00:26:23,334
Something so urgent I couldn't
trust the words to a raven.

311
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:26,270
You once charged me
with finding Arya Stark.

312
00:26:26,305 --> 00:26:29,223
To my shame, I failed you.

313
00:26:29,258 --> 00:26:31,559
But I have found Sansa Stark.

314
00:26:33,095 --> 00:26:36,481
Alive and well and home again

315
00:26:36,515 --> 00:26:37,982
living at Winterfell.

316
00:26:38,017 --> 00:26:40,268
That's not possible.

317
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:42,653
My sources are well placed.

318
00:26:43,822 --> 00:26:45,857
They tell me Roose Bolton

319
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:48,359
plans to marry her
to his son Ramsay,

320
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:51,079
a bastard recently
legitimized by King Tommen.

321
00:26:51,113 --> 00:26:55,083
Roose Bolton is Warden of the
North by the grace of my father.

322
00:26:55,117 --> 00:26:59,087
Indeed, his reward for stabbing
his own king in the heart.

323
00:27:00,372 --> 00:27:02,507
We were fools
to trust a turncloak.

324
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:04,959
Marrying his son
to the last of the Starks

325
00:27:04,961 --> 00:27:06,878
gives him more legitimacy
in the North

326
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:08,846
than an alliance with
a hated southern house.

327
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:12,266
I will skin him and his bastard

328
00:27:12,301 --> 00:27:14,135
like that wretch
on their bloody sigil.

329
00:27:14,137 --> 00:27:15,970
I would counsel
patience, Your Grace.

330
00:27:15,972 --> 00:27:17,855
Patience?

331
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,440
Sansa helped murder my son.

332
00:27:19,475 --> 00:27:21,025
Roose Bolton is a traitor.

333
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,027
Stannis Baratheon
is also a traitor,

334
00:27:23,112 --> 00:27:24,679
marching with his army
on Winterfell.

335
00:27:24,713 --> 00:27:27,198
Let Stannis and Roose battle.

336
00:27:27,232 --> 00:27:29,867
Let the enemies of the
throne slaughter each other.

337
00:27:29,902 --> 00:27:33,271
And when they're done, seize Winterfell
from whichever thief survives.

338
00:27:33,305 --> 00:27:35,790
Winterfell is 1,000 miles
away from here.

339
00:27:35,824 --> 00:27:37,992
The weather has already
begun to turn.

340
00:27:37,994 --> 00:27:40,928
That is why it is critical
to strike soon

341
00:27:40,963 --> 00:27:43,381
while the victor
still licks his wounds.

342
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:47,468
Surely your Uncle Kevan
could muster a force.

343
00:27:47,503 --> 00:27:50,838
My Uncle Kevan has all the
courage of a kitchen mouse.

344
00:27:50,873 --> 00:27:52,457
Ser Jaime, then.

345
00:27:52,491 --> 00:27:55,093
<i>Jaime's away on a sensitive
diplomatic mission.

346
00:27:55,127 --> 00:27:57,845
I have no idea
when he'll be back.

347
00:27:57,896 --> 00:28:00,348
<i>Perhaps I can help.

348
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:03,518
The Knights of the Vale are some
of the best fighters in Westeros,

349
00:28:03,569 --> 00:28:05,787
trained to battle
in the ice and the snow.

350
00:28:05,821 --> 00:28:08,689
Forgive me, Lord Baelish,

351
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,942
you have a reputation
as a moneylender

352
00:28:10,993 --> 00:28:13,528
and a brothel keeper,
not a military man.

353
00:28:13,579 --> 00:28:15,713
You wouldn't risk
a single Lannister soldier

354
00:28:15,747 --> 00:28:19,167
or a single coin
from the royal treasury.

355
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:20,918
What do you have to lose?

356
00:28:20,953 --> 00:28:22,820
A brothel keeper?

357
00:28:22,855 --> 00:28:24,372
And if you succeed?

358
00:28:24,374 --> 00:28:26,541
Name me Warden of the North.

359
00:28:30,963 --> 00:28:34,432
I'll speak to the king
this evening,

360
00:28:34,466 --> 00:28:36,634
have him issue a royal decree.

361
00:28:36,668 --> 00:28:39,520
I'll not rest until the
lion flies over Winterfell.

362
00:28:39,555 --> 00:28:41,839
And I'll know
you're a man of your word

363
00:28:41,874 --> 00:28:44,892
when I see Sansa Stark's
head on a spike.

364
00:28:44,943 --> 00:28:47,028
As I said...

365
00:28:47,062 --> 00:28:49,013
I live to serve.

366
00:28:54,486 --> 00:28:57,655
I'm going to ask him tomorrow.

367
00:28:59,241 --> 00:29:00,958
- What if he says no?
- He won't.

368
00:29:01,043 --> 00:29:03,411
We've waited long enough.

369
00:29:03,462 --> 00:29:05,663
I want you to be my wife.

370
00:29:05,714 --> 00:29:07,748
Now.

371
00:29:09,051 --> 00:29:10,668
What is it?

372
00:29:10,702 --> 00:29:13,638
Do you want to marry me because
our families arranged it?

373
00:29:13,672 --> 00:29:15,556
Or do you--

374
00:29:22,981 --> 00:29:25,600
We can't.
Not yet.

375
00:29:25,602 --> 00:29:26,817
Why not?

376
00:29:26,852 --> 00:29:28,903
You know why not.
Someone will see.

377
00:29:28,937 --> 00:29:31,272
You are going to be my wife.

378
00:29:31,323 --> 00:29:35,359
I am going to be your husband.

379
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:38,946
We're allowed to walk through
the gardens together.

380
00:29:38,948 --> 00:29:41,616
How many other girls have you
walked through these gardens?

381
00:29:43,585 --> 00:29:46,254
I like the way your eyes go
squinty when you're jealous.

382
00:29:46,288 --> 00:29:49,840
They do not go squinty and you
didn't answer the question.

383
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:52,310
They make a lovely couple.

384
00:29:52,344 --> 00:29:55,513
A Lannister and a Martell.

385
00:29:55,547 --> 00:29:58,966
<i>They have no idea</i>
<i>how dangerous that is.

386
00:29:59,001 --> 00:30:01,202
We must protect them.

387
00:30:01,236 --> 00:30:03,204
Yes, my prince.

388
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,942
You haven't had to use that
axe of yours in a long time.

389
00:30:09,645 --> 00:30:11,279
I hope you remember how.

390
00:30:11,313 --> 00:30:13,981
I remember how.

391
00:30:16,318 --> 00:30:20,197
<i> The Dornishman's
wife was as fair as the sun 

392
00:30:20,231 --> 00:30:25,319
 And her kisses
were warmer than spring 

393
00:30:25,353 --> 00:30:27,271
 The Dornishman's blade 

394
00:30:27,322 --> 00:30:29,606
 It was made of black steel 

395
00:30:29,657 --> 00:30:34,111
 And its kiss
was a terrible thing 

396
00:30:34,162 --> 00:30:38,365
 The Dornishman's wife
would sing as she bathed 

397
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:42,453
-  In a voice that was sweet as a peach-- 
- All right, that's enough.

398
00:30:42,504 --> 00:30:44,621
I'm coming to the best part.

399
00:30:44,672 --> 00:30:46,623
We're trying to blend in.

400
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:48,709
Don't want everyone in
Dorne to hear your accent.

401
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,544
This song really is
all about the ending.

402
00:30:50,628 --> 00:30:52,930
It can wait.
There.

403
00:30:56,301 --> 00:30:58,135
That's the Water Gardens.

404
00:30:58,137 --> 00:31:00,687
<i>And once we've got
the princess, then what?

405
00:31:03,108 --> 00:31:05,859
I like to improvise.

406
00:31:05,894 --> 00:31:08,245
That explains the golden hand.

407
00:31:27,715 --> 00:31:32,136
Unbowed. Unbent.
Unbroken.

408
00:31:33,671 --> 00:31:34,671
For Oberyn.

409
00:31:34,722 --> 00:31:36,673
For Oberyn.

410
00:32:16,214 --> 00:32:18,498
Well, she's made
herself at home.

411
00:32:24,189 --> 00:32:26,440
Myrcella.

412
00:32:28,977 --> 00:32:30,861
Uncle Jaime?

413
00:32:30,895 --> 00:32:32,896
I--

414
00:32:32,947 --> 00:32:35,148
I don't understand.
What are you doing here?

415
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,401
Let's speak in private.

416
00:32:37,403 --> 00:32:40,237
- I am Trystane Martell.
- Trystane is my intended.

417
00:32:40,288 --> 00:32:43,207
Excellent.
Good to meet you.

418
00:32:43,241 --> 00:32:45,209
We weren't expecting you,
Lord Jaime.

419
00:32:45,243 --> 00:32:47,995
Why don't you let them
have some time alone, son?

420
00:32:52,467 --> 00:32:54,668
Let's not do something stupid.

421
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,974
That was something stupid.

422
00:33:01,009 --> 00:33:02,559
We have to go, Myrcella, now.

423
00:33:02,594 --> 00:33:04,678
- You hurt him!
- He'll be fine, I promise.

424
00:33:04,729 --> 00:33:06,430
But we have to--

425
00:33:10,435 --> 00:33:12,319
Oh, for fuck's sake.

426
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:55,395
Take her!

427
00:33:58,032 --> 00:33:59,783
- You're coming with me.
- I don't want to.

428
00:33:59,817 --> 00:34:02,018
I wasn't asking, princess.

429
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,411
- Ah!
- Drop your weapons!

430
00:34:19,587 --> 00:34:21,922
<i>I am Obara Sand.

431
00:34:21,973 --> 00:34:24,341
Daughter of Oberyn Martell.

432
00:34:24,392 --> 00:34:27,678
I fight for Dorne.
Who do you fight for?

433
00:34:27,729 --> 00:34:29,680
Drop your weapons.

434
00:34:47,081 --> 00:34:51,034
When you were whole, it would
have been a good fight.

435
00:35:01,462 --> 00:35:03,547
You fight pretty good
for a little girl.

436
00:35:30,408 --> 00:35:32,459
Halt!

437
00:35:34,746 --> 00:35:38,665
Oh, you can smell the shit
from five miles away.

438
00:35:38,716 --> 00:35:40,884
Well, why have we stopped?
Go on.

439
00:35:44,772 --> 00:35:47,224
Rumors and gossip,
that's all they've got.

440
00:35:47,258 --> 00:35:49,393
It's theater, nothing more.

441
00:35:49,427 --> 00:35:52,562
If they arrested all the pillow
biters in King's Landing,

442
00:35:52,597 --> 00:35:55,599
there'd be no room left in the
dungeons for anyone else.

443
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,517
Everyone knew
about him and Renly.

444
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:01,104
Renly Baratheon shagged half the
stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms.

445
00:36:01,106 --> 00:36:02,989
Everyone knew, no one cared.

446
00:36:03,024 --> 00:36:04,608
But he was the king's brother.

447
00:36:04,659 --> 00:36:06,443
And Loras
is the queen's brother.

448
00:36:06,445 --> 00:36:08,912
No, no, no, no.
This is unacceptable.

449
00:36:08,946 --> 00:36:11,026
- Cersei's behind it.
- Yeah, of course she is.

450
00:36:11,032 --> 00:36:13,450
She wants to drag our
name through the dirt,

451
00:36:13,501 --> 00:36:15,335
put us in our place.

452
00:36:15,369 --> 00:36:17,454
Get some rest, dear.
You look appalling.

453
00:36:17,505 --> 00:36:19,673
Let me deal
with Cersei Lannister.

454
00:36:25,713 --> 00:36:29,182
Your Grace, I have
travelled a long way.

455
00:36:29,217 --> 00:36:31,685
You must be exhausted.

456
00:36:34,021 --> 00:36:36,857
Put the pen down, dear. We both
know you're not writing anything.

457
00:36:36,891 --> 00:36:40,227
Ah, yes. The famously
tart-tongued Queen of Thorns.

458
00:36:40,294 --> 00:36:43,280
And the famous tart
Queen Cersei.

459
00:36:46,984 --> 00:36:48,568
I beg your pardon?

460
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:52,205
I know you're behind this absurd
incarceration of my grandson.

461
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,075
If you apologize for that
comment, perhaps I'll--

462
00:36:55,126 --> 00:36:57,994
You'll get your apology
when I get Loras.

463
00:36:59,213 --> 00:37:01,081
I was as shocked as anyone

464
00:37:01,132 --> 00:37:03,750
when the Faith
arrested Ser Loras.

465
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:06,386
I have no love
for these fanatics,

466
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,022
but what can a Queen Mother do?

467
00:37:10,341 --> 00:37:12,259
Has the crown
suddenly stopped needing

468
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:15,562
the troops, gold, and
wheat my house supplies?

469
00:37:15,646 --> 00:37:17,647
I can assure you,

470
00:37:17,682 --> 00:37:19,683
our alliance with
House Tyrell remains--

471
00:37:19,734 --> 00:37:21,351
Do you expect
the alliance to continue

472
00:37:21,402 --> 00:37:24,104
after you've thrown
our future into prison?

473
00:37:24,188 --> 00:37:26,490
As I said,

474
00:37:26,524 --> 00:37:28,975
I didn't imprison anyone.

475
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:30,410
As for your
veiled threats--

476
00:37:30,444 --> 00:37:31,895
What veil?

477
00:37:34,248 --> 00:37:38,752
The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought
peace to a war-torn country.

478
00:37:38,819 --> 00:37:42,038
Do you really want to see the Seven
Kingdoms slide back into warfare?

479
00:37:45,176 --> 00:37:46,710
I didn't trust your father.

480
00:37:46,761 --> 00:37:49,379
<i>I didn't particularly like him.

481
00:37:49,381 --> 00:37:52,933
<i>But I respected him.</i>
<i>He was no fool.

482
00:37:52,967 --> 00:37:56,686
He understood that sometimes
we must work with our rivals

483
00:37:56,721 --> 00:37:58,271
rather than destroy them.

484
00:37:58,306 --> 00:38:00,524
House Lannister has no rival.

485
00:38:02,944 --> 00:38:06,429
The High Septon has called
for an inquest, not a trial.

486
00:38:06,464 --> 00:38:08,148
Just a small hearing
to determine

487
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:11,034
whether the charges
against Loras have merit,

488
00:38:11,068 --> 00:38:13,086
which I'm sure they don't.

489
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,606
Loras will be freed, our happy
alliance will continue...

490
00:38:18,326 --> 00:38:21,244
and we'll forget this unfortunate
conversation ever happened.

491
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:24,581
Good day, Lady Olenna.

492
00:38:44,235 --> 00:38:46,987
You are aware of the rumors
concerning you and Renly?

493
00:38:48,105 --> 00:38:50,690
I don't pay attention to rumors.

494
00:38:50,741 --> 00:38:54,060
<i>You were said to be
despondent when he died.

495
00:38:54,095 --> 00:38:57,631
Witnesses state that you
refused to leave his bedside

496
00:38:57,665 --> 00:39:00,200
even as Stannis's army
closed in.

497
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:04,087
He was my friend.
He was my king.

498
00:39:04,121 --> 00:39:06,539
Wasn't Joffrey your king?

499
00:39:06,591 --> 00:39:09,593
<i>He was anointed</i>
<i>by the Seven, not Renly.

500
00:39:09,627 --> 00:39:14,180
I was wrong to support
Renly's claim, I know that.

501
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:17,767
But I was forgiven by Joffrey.

502
00:39:17,802 --> 00:39:20,270
I fought for him at the
Battle of Blackwater.

503
00:39:20,304 --> 00:39:23,974
Yes, wearing Renly's armor.

504
00:39:23,976 --> 00:39:26,359
Why does it matter what I wore?

505
00:39:26,394 --> 00:39:29,029
Do you deny all
the charges against you?

506
00:39:29,063 --> 00:39:31,114
Fornication.

507
00:39:31,148 --> 00:39:33,316
<i>Buggery.</i>
<i>Blasphemy.

508
00:39:33,318 --> 00:39:34,951
Of course I deny them.

509
00:39:34,986 --> 00:39:37,037
You never lay
with Renly Baratheon?

510
00:39:37,071 --> 00:39:39,022
Never.

511
00:39:39,056 --> 00:39:41,207
<i>Nor any other man?

512
00:39:41,242 --> 00:39:42,859
Never.

513
00:39:45,212 --> 00:39:47,831
That will be all, Ser Loras.

514
00:39:55,006 --> 00:39:57,724
Well, I think that's
quite enough of that.

515
00:39:57,758 --> 00:40:00,343
The Faith calls
Queen Margaery forward.

516
00:40:00,394 --> 00:40:02,345
You call me forward?

517
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,731
Yes, we have some
questions for you.

518
00:40:04,765 --> 00:40:08,868
- I am the queen.
- You are.

519
00:40:08,903 --> 00:40:11,338
And according
to the law of the Seven,

520
00:40:11,372 --> 00:40:13,773
neither kings
nor queens are exempt

521
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:16,693
from testimony
at a holy inquest.

522
00:40:34,712 --> 00:40:38,381
How do you respond to these
charges against your brother?

523
00:40:38,383 --> 00:40:40,150
They are lies.

524
00:40:40,184 --> 00:40:41,851
- All of them?
- All of them.

525
00:40:41,886 --> 00:40:44,838
<i>Queen Margaery,

526
00:40:44,872 --> 00:40:46,389
<i>in the presence of the gods,

527
00:40:46,424 --> 00:40:48,641
do you swear that your
brother is innocent

528
00:40:48,693 --> 00:40:50,560
of these charges against him

529
00:40:50,611 --> 00:40:52,228
to the best of your knowledge?

530
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:54,314
Yes, I swear it.

531
00:40:55,566 --> 00:40:57,817
Thank you, Your Grace.

532
00:41:23,344 --> 00:41:25,095
Do you know this man?

533
00:41:25,146 --> 00:41:28,648
Yes, very well.

534
00:41:28,682 --> 00:41:31,434
<i>He is Ser Loras Tyrell,</i>
<i>heir to Highgarden.

535
00:41:31,436 --> 00:41:34,104
How did you come to meet?

536
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:36,773
<i>I squired for him.

537
00:41:36,807 --> 00:41:38,608
He took a liking to me.

538
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:41,820
He summoned me to his chamber
the first day we met.

539
00:41:42,863 --> 00:41:46,616
And what occurred
in his chamber?

540
00:41:46,618 --> 00:41:51,121
We engaged
in intimate relations.

541
00:41:51,123 --> 00:41:52,956
You lay with him?

542
00:41:53,007 --> 00:41:54,541
That night and many others.

543
00:41:54,592 --> 00:41:57,043
Liar.
He's a liar.

544
00:41:58,596 --> 00:42:00,463
Is there anyone else
who can support your claim?

545
00:42:00,465 --> 00:42:02,766
Yes.

546
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,685
Yes, Queen Margaery.

547
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:09,105
<i>She walked in on us once</i>
<i>not long ago.

548
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,808
She didn't seem surprised.

549
00:42:11,859 --> 00:42:15,779
This testimony is an insult
to a great house.

550
00:42:15,813 --> 00:42:18,982
Why should the Faith or anyone
else take the word of a squire

551
00:42:18,984 --> 00:42:20,650
over the heir to Highgarden?

552
00:42:20,701 --> 00:42:22,702
<i>He has a birthmark, Your Grace.

553
00:42:22,787 --> 00:42:25,655
<i>Quite high on his thigh.

554
00:42:25,706 --> 00:42:28,725
Wine-colored and roughly
the shape of Dorne.

555
00:42:28,793 --> 00:42:31,294
No! Liar!

556
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:37,000
What are you doing?
Let us pass.

557
00:42:37,002 --> 00:42:39,502
The Faith is satisfied
there is enough evidence

558
00:42:39,553 --> 00:42:41,471
to bring a formal trial

559
00:42:41,505 --> 00:42:43,756
<i>for Ser Loras

560
00:42:43,808 --> 00:42:45,592
and Queen Margaery.

561
00:42:45,643 --> 00:42:46,893
What?

562
00:42:46,927 --> 00:42:48,978
Bearing false witness
before the gods

563
00:42:49,013 --> 00:42:51,648
<i>is as grave a sin</i>
<i>as any, my lady.

564
00:42:51,682 --> 00:42:53,399
Take her.

565
00:42:53,484 --> 00:42:56,152
<i>No. Tommen.

566
00:42:56,187 --> 00:42:57,937
Tommen!

567
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:01,274
You can't do this.
I am the queen.

568
00:43:01,325 --> 00:43:03,993
Tommen!
Tommen!

569
00:43:04,028 --> 00:43:06,529
<i>I am your queen.</i>
<i>How dare you?

570
00:43:06,531 --> 00:43:08,064
<i>Take your hands off me!

571
00:43:08,132 --> 00:43:10,750
<i>Tommen!

572
00:43:33,974 --> 00:43:36,142
What do you want?

573
00:43:36,193 --> 00:43:39,028
Lord Ramsay sent me to
draw you a bath, my lady.

574
00:43:39,063 --> 00:43:41,798
You want to be clean and fresh

575
00:43:41,832 --> 00:43:43,872
for your new husband, don't you?

576
00:44:00,467 --> 00:44:03,086
You're so beautiful,

577
00:44:03,088 --> 00:44:06,139
but you need to keep him happy.

578
00:44:06,173 --> 00:44:10,426
Ramsay gets bored easily.

579
00:44:10,477 --> 00:44:12,595
You don't want
to end up like--

580
00:44:14,565 --> 00:44:17,183
well, like the others.

581
00:44:17,234 --> 00:44:19,569
What others?

582
00:44:19,603 --> 00:44:21,854
I shouldn't gossip.

583
00:44:21,906 --> 00:44:24,490
Oh, it's good to see
the red again.

584
00:44:24,525 --> 00:44:26,526
No point hiding anymore.

585
00:44:26,577 --> 00:44:28,027
What others?

586
00:44:28,078 --> 00:44:30,663
Let's see, there was Kyra

587
00:44:30,698 --> 00:44:32,665
the blacksmith's daughter.

588
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:35,285
She was tall like you,
lovely figure.

589
00:44:35,336 --> 00:44:39,789
But she talked
and talked and talked

590
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,209
and Ramsay grew tired of that.

591
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,762
Then there was Violet.

592
00:44:45,796 --> 00:44:48,298
She had gorgeous blonde hair.

593
00:44:48,349 --> 00:44:51,301
But she got pregnant.

594
00:44:51,303 --> 00:44:54,220
And, well, that was boring.

595
00:44:54,271 --> 00:44:57,941
Then Tansy.

596
00:44:57,975 --> 00:44:59,609
Such a sweet girl.

597
00:44:59,643 --> 00:45:04,814
Of course, sweet girls
get a bit dull

598
00:45:04,865 --> 00:45:06,950
after a while, don't they?

599
00:45:06,984 --> 00:45:09,285
Ramsay let me come
with him on that hunt.

600
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,453
Hunt?

601
00:45:10,487 --> 00:45:12,322
Mmm.

602
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:18,661
Have you ever seen a body after
the dogs have been at it?

603
00:45:18,712 --> 00:45:20,580
Not so pretty.

604
00:45:22,549 --> 00:45:25,718
But, well, it's your
wedding day.

605
00:45:26,134 --> 00:45:28,253
Why am I talking
about such things?

606
00:45:30,557 --> 00:45:32,342
What was your name again?

607
00:45:32,393 --> 00:45:34,010
Myranda.

608
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,848
And how long have yo
loved him, Myranda?

609
00:45:42,236 --> 00:45:45,357
Did you imagine that he would be
with you forever, is that it?

610
00:45:45,406 --> 00:45:47,573
And I came along and ruined it.

611
00:45:50,778 --> 00:45:54,197
I'm Sansa Stark of Winterfell.

612
00:45:54,248 --> 00:45:58,668
This is my home
and you can't frighten me.

613
00:46:04,475 --> 00:46:07,260
Are you done with
your bath, my lady?

614
00:46:08,262 --> 00:46:10,262
Go. I can finish
on my own.

615
00:46:34,705 --> 00:46:37,240
Yes?

616
00:46:44,715 --> 00:46:49,268
I've come to escort you
to the godswood, my lady.

617
00:46:53,841 --> 00:46:57,143
If you please, my lady,
will you take my arm?

618
00:46:57,227 --> 00:46:59,679
No.

619
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:03,015
Lord Ramsay, he said
I'm to take your arm.

620
00:47:03,067 --> 00:47:04,567
I'm not touching you.

621
00:47:06,487 --> 00:47:08,404
Please.

622
00:47:08,439 --> 00:47:10,406
He'll punish me.

623
00:47:12,276 --> 00:47:14,944
You think I care
what he does to you?

624
00:48:32,022 --> 00:48:34,991
Who comes before
the old gods this night?

625
00:48:36,193 --> 00:48:39,612
Sansa of the House Stark

626
00:48:39,663 --> 00:48:42,365
comes here to be wed.

627
00:48:44,535 --> 00:48:48,287
A woman grown,
trueborn and noble.

628
00:48:48,338 --> 00:48:52,758
She comes to beg the
blessings of the gods.

629
00:48:54,595 --> 00:48:56,712
Who comes to claim her?

630
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:07,607
Ramsay of House Bolton.

631
00:49:08,942 --> 00:49:11,227
<i>Heir to the Dreadfort</i>
<i>and Winterfell.

632
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:16,199
Who gives her?

633
00:49:18,452 --> 00:49:23,656
Theon of House Greyjoy,
who was--

634
00:49:28,078 --> 00:49:29,629
who was her father's ward.

635
00:49:31,915 --> 00:49:35,468
Lady Sansa,
will you take this man?

636
00:50:05,249 --> 00:50:07,066
I take this man.

637
00:50:38,565 --> 00:50:40,733
Are you pleased, my lady?

638
00:50:43,487 --> 00:50:46,522
Good. I want you
to be happy.

639
00:50:56,717 --> 00:50:59,385
My father said
you're still a virgin.

640
00:51:05,008 --> 00:51:07,677
- Uh, yes.
- Why?

641
00:51:11,348 --> 00:51:14,600
Why are you still a virgin?

642
00:51:15,286 --> 00:51:16,905
Afraid of dwarves?

643
00:51:18,438 --> 00:51:20,523
Lord-- Lord Tyrion was kind.

644
00:51:20,574 --> 00:51:24,126
He was gentle.
He never touched me.

645
00:51:25,762 --> 00:51:27,113
You're not lying to me?

646
00:51:27,197 --> 00:51:28,948
No, my lord.

647
00:51:28,982 --> 00:51:31,717
Lying to your husband
on his wedding night,

648
00:51:31,752 --> 00:51:35,254
that would be a bad way
to start a marriage.

649
00:51:40,177 --> 00:51:43,295
We're man and wife now.

650
00:51:43,347 --> 00:51:45,381
We should be honest
with each other.

651
00:51:45,515 --> 00:51:47,216
Don't you think?

652
00:51:48,218 --> 00:51:50,136
Yes.

653
00:52:00,147 --> 00:52:01,981
Good.

654
00:52:04,234 --> 00:52:06,068
Take off your clothes.

655
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,074
Oh, no, no, no.

656
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:15,127
You stay here, Reek.

657
00:52:15,162 --> 00:52:17,413
You watch.

658
00:52:29,476 --> 00:52:32,495
Do I need to ask a second time?

659
00:52:32,562 --> 00:52:34,764
I hate asking a second time.

660
00:53:02,709 --> 00:53:03,926
Reek...

661
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:07,163
I told you to watch.

662
00:53:12,903 --> 00:53:15,971
You've known Sansa
since she was a girl.

663
00:53:17,274 --> 00:53:18,892
Now watch her become a woman.

664
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:10,860

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
