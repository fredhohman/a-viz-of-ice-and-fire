00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:09,059
<i>Brace the wind.</i>

7
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,781
The Lord of Light has made good
on his promise, my king.

8
00:02:13,816 --> 00:02:16,617
His fires have melted
the snows away.

9
00:02:16,652 --> 00:02:18,235
The way ahead is clear.

10
00:02:18,321 --> 00:02:19,820
We ride for Winterfell.

11
00:02:19,872 --> 00:02:21,288
And you will take it.

12
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:26,293
The Lord has shown me
Bolton banners burning.

13
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:28,963
You will receive
what is yours by right.

14
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:51,769
Your Grace.

15
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,270
Prepare to form up.

16
00:02:53,322 --> 00:02:55,072
Your Grace.

17
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,693
Tell me.

18
00:02:59,745 --> 00:03:03,414
The men, many deserted
before dawn.

19
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,618
<i>How many?</i>

20
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,670
<i>Nearly half.</i>

21
00:03:09,705 --> 00:03:12,590
All the sellswords
with all the horses.

22
00:03:23,352 --> 00:03:25,469
Your Grace.

23
00:03:27,223 --> 00:03:30,858
Speak up.
Can't be worse than mutiny.

24
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,340
Cut her down.

25
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:18,322
<i>Your Grace.</i>

26
00:04:18,357 --> 00:04:21,325
The Lady Melisandre
was just seen riding out of camp.

27
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,706
Get the men
into marching formation.

28
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:39,677
On to Winterfell.

29
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:47,301
He raised his hands

30
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,637
and they all stood up
at once.

31
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:56,026
Tens of thousands of them.
The biggest army in the world.

32
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,695
So what are you
gonna do?

33
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,734
I'm gonna hope they don't
learn how to climb the Wall.

34
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:06,570
But the dragonglass...

35
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,406
No one's ever
getting that back now.

36
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:12,042
<i>It wouldn't have</i>
<i>mattered anyway.</i>

37
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,494
<i>Not unless we had</i>
<i>a mountain of it.</i>

38
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:16,163
But you killed
a white walker.

39
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:17,798
<i>With Longclaw.</i>

40
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:21,585
I saw them shatter steel axes
like they were glass.

41
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:24,588
- But Longclaw...
<i>-  Is Valyrian steel.</i>

42
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,174
How many Valyrian steel swords
are left in the Seven Kingdoms?

43
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,009
Not enough.

44
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:33,097
The first Lord Commander
in history

45
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,516
to sacrifice the lives
of sworn brothers

46
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,651
to save the lives
of wildlings.

47
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,274
How's it feel to be friends
with the most hated man in Castle Black?

48
00:05:44,326 --> 00:05:46,360
<i>You were friends with me</i>
<i>when I first came here.</i>

49
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,495
And I wasn't winning
any elections back then.

50
00:05:48,531 --> 00:05:51,582
Here's to us, then.

51
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,283
Long may they sneer.

52
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:03,510
What?

53
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:07,681
I wanted to ask
you something.

54
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:11,268
To ask something of you.

55
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:17,057
Send me, Gilly,
and the baby to Oldtown

56
00:06:17,109 --> 00:06:19,276
so I can become a maester.

57
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:22,062
That's what I'm meant to be.
Not this.

58
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:25,315
I need you here, Sam.

59
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:27,818
If you leave, who's left
to give me advice I trust?

60
00:06:28,871 --> 00:06:31,238
Well, there's Edd.

61
00:06:34,076 --> 00:06:36,577
I'd be more use
to you as a maester.

62
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:40,581
More use to everyone
now that Maester Aemon is gone.

63
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:43,417
The Citadel has the world's
greatest library.

64
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:46,670
I'll learn about history,

65
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:49,173
strategy, healing.

66
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:50,841
And other things,

67
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:53,844
things that will
help when--

68
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:55,479
when they come.

69
00:06:58,517 --> 00:07:01,185
If Gilly stays here,
then she'll die.

70
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:06,023
And the baby that she named
after me will die.

71
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:09,276
And I'll end up dying, too,
trying to protect them.

72
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,248
Which means that the last thing that
I'll see in this world

73
00:07:14,283 --> 00:07:17,251
will be the look in her eyes
when I fail them.

74
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,175
And I'd rather see
a thousand white walkers than see that.

75
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,725
Thank you.

76
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,395
You know that the Citadel will make you
swear off women, too.

77
00:07:45,447 --> 00:07:47,731
Oh, they'll bloody try.

78
00:07:51,453 --> 00:07:53,787
- Sam.
- What?

79
00:07:55,407 --> 00:07:57,407
Sam.

80
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,245
You had just been
beaten half to death. How did you--

81
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,881
Oh, very carefully.

82
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm glad
the end of the world's

83
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,752
working out well
for someone.

84
00:08:13,592 --> 00:08:15,642
I'll come back.

85
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,096
To your return.

86
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:21,765
To my return.

87
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:03,700
<i>Aye, this way.</i>

88
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,736
<i>My lady!</i>

89
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:43,457
Stannis.

90
00:10:43,492 --> 00:10:45,625
Stannis Baratheon is coming.
His whole army.

91
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:47,077
How do you know
it's Stannis?

92
00:10:47,162 --> 00:10:49,046
They're carrying his
flaming heart banners.

93
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:52,632
From the Blackwater.
I'll never forget it.

94
00:11:29,872 --> 00:11:31,505
Trench here.

95
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,757
Another one 300 yards
from the castle wall.

96
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,959
Hurry them along.

97
00:11:36,011 --> 00:11:37,511
- Right, Curlew.
- Yes, sir.

98
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:38,762
<i>Dig between those two rises.</i>

99
00:11:38,797 --> 00:11:40,680
- Spread out.
<i>-  I'm with you.</i>

100
00:11:40,716 --> 00:11:42,966
<i>- Archers!</i>
<i>- Spread out!</i>

101
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,552
And send out
a foraging party immediately.

102
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,888
Siege begins
at sunrise.

103
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,357
There's not going
to be a siege, Your Grace.

104
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,518
<i>We've got no chance!</i>

105
00:13:43,922 --> 00:13:46,473
<i>No, please, please.</i>

106
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,028
Bolton has women
fighting for him?

107
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:45,315
I don't fight
for the Boltons.

108
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,702
I'm Brienne of Tarth.

109
00:14:50,822 --> 00:14:53,657
I was Kingsguard
to Renly Baratheon.

110
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:03,500
I was there when he was
murdered by a shadow with your face.

111
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:09,673
<i>You murdered him</i>
<i>with blood magic?</i>

112
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,013
I did.

113
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:28,441
In the name of Renly
of House Baratheon,

114
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:30,193
First of His Name,

115
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:33,196
rightful King of the Andals
and the First Men,

116
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:36,499
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm,

117
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:40,587
I, Brienne of Tarth,
sentence you to die.

118
00:15:46,795 --> 00:15:49,045
Do you have
any last words?

119
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,357
Go on, do your duty.

120
00:16:18,293 --> 00:16:20,493
Looks like we're done here.

121
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,346
I surrender!
I surrender!

122
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,398
And I accept
your surrender.

123
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:55,111
Let's head back.

124
00:16:55,113 --> 00:16:57,447
My wife must be lonely.

125
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,198
My lady.

126
00:17:32,234 --> 00:17:34,484
I've come to escort you
back to your chamber.

127
00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:37,070
Go with her, please.

128
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:43,827
I know what Ramsay is.

129
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,045
I know what
he'll do to me.

130
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,334
If I'm going to die,

131
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:54,838
let it happen while there's
still some of me left.

132
00:17:56,892 --> 00:17:58,558
Die?

133
00:17:59,594 --> 00:18:01,010
Who said anything
about dying?

134
00:18:01,062 --> 00:18:02,729
You can't die.

135
00:18:02,764 --> 00:18:04,514
Your father was
Warden of the North.

136
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,516
Ramsay needs you.

137
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,938
Though I suppose
he doesn't need all of you.

138
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,657
Just the parts he'll use
to make his heir,

139
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,827
until you've given him a boy or two
and he's finished using them.

140
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:24,451
Then he's got incredible
plans for those parts.

141
00:18:25,787 --> 00:18:27,704
So, shall we wait
for him to come back

142
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,706
or should we begin now?

143
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,877
You're leaving it to me?

144
00:18:33,962 --> 00:18:35,545
Good.

145
00:18:35,597 --> 00:18:37,347
Let's begin.

146
00:18:39,684 --> 00:18:41,885
Reek-- stop!

147
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,770
Stop!

148
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:53,563
<i>-  Open the gate!</i>

149
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,572
He's coming back.

150
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:41,254
I can see I have
my work cut out for me.

151
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:43,506
You two, out.

152
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:41,648
You were the first person
on my list, you know.

153
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,734
For killing Syrio Forel.
Remember him?

154
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,070
Probably not.

155
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:52,208
I've gotten a few
of the others.

156
00:21:52,243 --> 00:21:55,411
The Many-Faced God stole
a few more from me.

157
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:57,964
But I'm glad
he left me you.

158
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,636
Do you know who I am?

159
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:10,093
I can't hear you.

160
00:22:18,486 --> 00:22:20,820
You know who I am.

161
00:22:20,855 --> 00:22:22,939
I'm Arya Stark.

162
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,500
Do you know
who you are?

163
00:22:36,921 --> 00:22:38,671
You're no one.

164
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,791
You're nothing.

165
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,670
A girl has taken a life.

166
00:23:27,722 --> 00:23:30,173
The wrong life.

167
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,010
I was right about her.

168
00:23:34,095 --> 00:23:35,511
You were.

169
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,348
You're not ready.

170
00:23:40,935 --> 00:23:42,685
Not at all.

171
00:23:46,107 --> 00:23:48,908
That man's life
was not yours to take.

172
00:23:50,411 --> 00:23:52,528
A girl stole from
the Many-Faced God.

173
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,415
Now a debt is owed.

174
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,373
Only death
can pay for life.

175
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,806
No! No!

176
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:23,276
No, you-- don't die!
Don't die!

177
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,616
Why are you crying?

178
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,820
He was my friend.

179
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:36,572
No, he wasn't.
Didn't you listen to him?

180
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,909
<i>He was no one.</i>

181
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:45,164
But if you're--

182
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,135
who's this?

183
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,087
<i>No one at all.</i>

184
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:54,841
Just as a girl should have been
before she took a face from the hall.

185
00:25:00,982 --> 00:25:03,649
<i>The faces are for no one.</i>

186
00:25:03,685 --> 00:25:05,268
You are still someone.

187
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,690
And to someone,

188
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,275
the faces are as good
as poison.

189
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,123
I can't see.

190
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:35,882
What's happening?

191
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:38,017
What's happening?!

192
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:50,980
<i>- I wish you a safe journey home.</i>
- Thank you.

193
00:25:56,037 --> 00:25:58,487
Forgive me, child.

194
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:02,375
I wish you all the happiness
in the world.

195
00:26:19,677 --> 00:26:21,894
Maybe I'll come
visit you sometime.

196
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,846
Maybe I'll come
visit you.

197
00:26:23,898 --> 00:26:25,514
Don't wait too long.

198
00:26:25,566 --> 00:26:27,266
Got a noblewoman
to marry back home.

199
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,019
You want a good girl,

200
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:32,321
but you need
the bad pussy.

201
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,660
<i>Whenever you're</i>
<i>ready, my lord.</i>

202
00:26:53,344 --> 00:26:55,711
Try not to lose it
this time.

203
00:26:57,715 --> 00:27:00,599
I'll never
take it off again.

204
00:27:00,635 --> 00:27:03,636
I know you didn't
want to leave Dorne,

205
00:27:03,721 --> 00:27:05,855
but I'm glad
you're coming home.

206
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,606
Your mother's desperate
to see you.

207
00:27:07,642 --> 00:27:10,026
I'm glad Trystane
is coming with us.

208
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:11,861
He seems like a nice boy.

209
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,646
You're lucky.

210
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:17,033
Arranged marriages
are rarely so--

211
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:19,235
so well arranged.

212
00:27:19,287 --> 00:27:20,987
Do you think Mother
will like him?

213
00:27:22,457 --> 00:27:25,875
If she sees you're happy,
I'm sure she will.

214
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,243
You really believe that?

215
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:30,046
Have you ever known
your mother to like anyone

216
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,415
aside from her children?

217
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,250
She likes you.

218
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:37,136
I'm not so sure
about that.

219
00:27:37,221 --> 00:27:38,754
Listen...

220
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:43,009
there's something
I wanted to tell you.

221
00:27:44,345 --> 00:27:47,513
Something I should
have told you long ago.

222
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:49,398
So...

223
00:27:51,652 --> 00:27:54,270
now that you've seen
more of the world,

224
00:27:54,322 --> 00:27:57,990
you've learned how complicated
things can be,

225
00:27:58,026 --> 00:28:00,109
people can be.

226
00:28:00,161 --> 00:28:03,446
The Lannisters and the Martells have
hated each other for years,

227
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,698
but you've fallen
in love with Trystane.

228
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,451
It was an accident, really.
I mean, what were the chances?

229
00:28:08,503 --> 00:28:10,286
You happen to fall
in love with the man

230
00:28:10,338 --> 00:28:12,455
you were assigned
to marry?

231
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,206
My point is...

232
00:28:16,427 --> 00:28:19,462
we don't choose
whom we love.

233
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,764
It just, well--

234
00:28:23,885 --> 00:28:26,385
it's beyond our control.

235
00:28:26,437 --> 00:28:28,304
- I sound like an idiot.
- No, you don't.

236
00:28:28,356 --> 00:28:30,890
What I'm trying to say--
what I'm trying

237
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:32,224
and failing to say--

238
00:28:32,276 --> 00:28:33,642
I know what
you're trying to say.

239
00:28:33,694 --> 00:28:36,062
No, I'm afraid you don't.

240
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,780
I do.

241
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:43,652
I know.

242
00:28:43,654 --> 00:28:45,237
About you and Mother.

243
00:28:47,658 --> 00:28:50,042
I think a part of me
always knew.

244
00:28:51,829 --> 00:28:54,797
And I'm glad.

245
00:28:57,835 --> 00:29:00,419
I'm glad
that you're my father.

246
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:37,206
Myrcella?

247
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:41,844
Myrcella?

248
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:51,103
Myrcella?
Myrcella?

249
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,467
You love her,
don't you?

250
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,606
How could you not?

251
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:21,060
Of course it's hopeless
for the both of you.

252
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:24,647
A sellsword from the fighting pits,
a disgraced knight.

253
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,782
Neither one of you
is fit consort for a queen.

254
00:31:28,986 --> 00:31:33,072
But we always want
the wrong woman.

255
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:35,207
Does he always
talk so much?

256
00:31:38,045 --> 00:31:40,296
Jorah the Andal.

257
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:42,498
Torgo Nudho.

258
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:44,049
He should not be here.

259
00:31:44,085 --> 00:31:45,417
No, but he is.

260
00:31:45,469 --> 00:31:48,137
Our queen ordered him
exiled from city.

261
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:50,422
Our queen would be dead
if not for him.

262
00:32:12,947 --> 00:32:15,698
<i>Puñila.</i>
Thank you.

263
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:18,500
I am sorry.

264
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:21,036
Sorry I not there
to fight for our queen.

265
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:23,038
You missed a good scrap.

266
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,040
None of that matters now.

267
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:25,507
The longer we sit
here bantering,

268
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:28,093
the longer Daenerys is out there
in the wilderness.

269
00:32:28,129 --> 00:32:30,512
He's right.
The dragon headed north.

270
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:32,548
If we're going to find her,
that's where we'll have to go.

271
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,682
We?

272
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,601
You're a Lannister.

273
00:32:35,636 --> 00:32:38,554
The queen intends to remove
your family from power.

274
00:32:38,606 --> 00:32:40,306
And I intend
to help her do it.

275
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:42,975
You've been here
for how many days now?

276
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,560
I've fought
for her for years.

277
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:46,145
Since she was little
more than a child.

278
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,447
- You betrayed her.
- Careful now.

279
00:32:48,482 --> 00:32:50,899
And she exiled you.
Twice, I believe.

280
00:32:50,951 --> 00:32:52,534
The second time
thanks to you.

281
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,903
Don't blame me
for your crimes, Mormont.

282
00:32:54,905 --> 00:32:57,623
He's right.
Our queen exiled Jorah.

283
00:32:57,658 --> 00:33:00,659
And he's right.
Jorah saved her life.

284
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:02,711
Perhaps she feels
differently about him now.

285
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:05,247
Perhaps not. The only way
we'll know is if we ask her.

286
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:08,967
<i>Fine, fine.</i>
<i>I suppose he can join us.</i>

287
00:33:09,003 --> 00:33:11,553
Just as long as he promises
not to kill me in my sleep.

288
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:14,807
If I ever kill you,
your eyes will be wide open.

289
00:33:14,842 --> 00:33:17,593
Forgive me, but why would
we bring you?

290
00:33:19,096 --> 00:33:20,429
Pardon me?

291
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:22,564
Have you ever tracked
animals in the wilderness?

292
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,434
Not precisely, but I have other skills
that would be useful.

293
00:33:25,486 --> 00:33:27,486
Can you fight?

294
00:33:27,571 --> 00:33:28,937
I have fought.

295
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:30,773
I don't claim to be
a great warrior.

296
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:32,858
Are you good
on a horse?

297
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,276
Middling.

298
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:36,412
So mainly you talk.

299
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,614
And drink.
I've survived so far.

300
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:42,034
Which I respect, but you would
not help us on this expedition.

301
00:33:43,954 --> 00:33:46,004
You would help us
here in Meereen, though.

302
00:33:47,124 --> 00:33:48,874
None of us have experience
governing a city

303
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:50,125
except for him.

304
00:33:50,177 --> 00:33:52,177
You want to prove
your value to the queen?

305
00:33:52,213 --> 00:33:53,545
Prove it right here
in Meereen.

306
00:33:53,597 --> 00:33:56,348
He's a foreign dwarf
that barely speaks the language.

307
00:33:56,384 --> 00:33:57,850
Why would the Meereenese
listen to him?

308
00:33:57,885 --> 00:33:59,768
They wouldn't.

309
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,687
They will listen
to Grey Worm.

310
00:34:01,722 --> 00:34:03,355
I'll come with you.

311
00:34:03,391 --> 00:34:05,441
I'll find our queen.

312
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:07,893
- You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
- I am.

313
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:10,195
He is. He's the toughest man
with no balls I ever met.

314
00:34:10,231 --> 00:34:13,365
But you still can't go.

315
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,117
The people believe in you.

316
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:16,952
They know you speak
for the queen.

317
00:34:16,987 --> 00:34:18,904
It's true.

318
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:20,989
Only the Unsullied can keep
the peace in Meereen.

319
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:24,326
If you leave, half this city will
consume the other half.

320
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:26,578
And Missandei.

321
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,548
Our queen trusts no one
more than Missandei.

322
00:34:29,583 --> 00:34:32,334
Certainly not me.

323
00:34:32,386 --> 00:34:34,503
The queen's
closest confidante,

324
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:37,172
the commander
of the Unsullied,

325
00:34:37,224 --> 00:34:39,975
and a foreign dwarf
with a scarred face.

326
00:34:41,178 --> 00:34:42,644
Good fortune,
my friends.

327
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,563
Meereen is ancient
and glorious.

328
00:34:44,598 --> 00:34:46,648
Try not to ruin her.

329
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:50,185
Looks like it's you and me,
Jorah the Andal.

330
00:34:50,187 --> 00:34:52,271
Let's find
some good horses.

331
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,690
We have so much
to talk about.

332
00:35:27,641 --> 00:35:29,641
Hello, old friend.

333
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:35,197
I thought we were so happy together
until you abandoned me.

334
00:35:37,067 --> 00:35:39,868
I suppose there's no point
asking how you found me.

335
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,237
The birds sing in the west,
the birds sing in the east,

336
00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:44,540
if one knows
how to listen.

337
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:47,409
They tell me you've
already found favor

338
00:35:47,461 --> 00:35:49,578
with the Mother
of Dragons.

339
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,331
Well, she didn't
execute me,

340
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:55,717
so that's
a promising start.

341
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:57,836
Now the heroes
are off to find her

342
00:35:57,888 --> 00:36:00,055
and I'm stuck here

343
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:03,675
trying to placate a city
on the brink of civil war.

344
00:36:03,727 --> 00:36:05,477
Any advice
for an old comrade?

345
00:36:05,513 --> 00:36:07,012
Information is the key.

346
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,598
You need to learn
your enemy's strengths and strategies.

347
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:14,152
You need to learn which of your friends
are not your friends.

348
00:36:14,188 --> 00:36:17,489
If only I knew someone
with a vast network of spies.

349
00:36:17,525 --> 00:36:19,575
If only.

350
00:36:21,278 --> 00:36:24,363
A grand old city

351
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:27,115
choking on violence,
corruption, and deceit.

352
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:30,118
Who could possibly
have any experience

353
00:36:30,204 --> 00:36:33,005
managing such a massive,
ungainly beast?

354
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:40,963
I did miss you.

355
00:36:42,132 --> 00:36:43,849
Oh, I know.

356
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,322
We have to go home.

357
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:16,832
Oh, my poor,
sweet thing.

358
00:37:16,884 --> 00:37:19,001
Does it hurt?

359
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,672
We have to go home.

360
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:28,260
Drogon.

361
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:30,512
Can you take me
back to Meereen?

362
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:37,185
How far
did you carry me?

363
00:37:45,245 --> 00:37:47,696
Drogon, we need
to return.

364
00:37:47,748 --> 00:37:49,498
My people need me.

365
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:23,782
Well, there's no food.

366
00:38:23,817 --> 00:38:26,902
At the very least,
you could hunt us some supper.

367
00:41:04,394 --> 00:41:05,861
Confess.

368
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:11,867
Confess.

369
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:25,247
I have sinned.

370
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:28,083
I see that now.

371
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:30,802
How can I have been
so blind for so long?

372
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:35,006
I want to be clean again.

373
00:41:36,226 --> 00:41:38,426
I want absolution.

374
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:44,232
The Crone came to me
with her lamp raised high.

375
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:45,934
And by its holy light--

376
00:41:45,986 --> 00:41:48,520
You wish to make
a confession?

377
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:54,192
Once I've confessed,
will I be free?

378
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:57,279
Your Grace will be
dealt with according to her sins.

379
00:41:59,616 --> 00:42:01,833
The Mother have
mercy, then.

380
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:06,955
I lay with a man outside
the bonds of marriage. I confess.

381
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:08,707
Name him.

382
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,296
Lancel Lannister.

383
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:17,549
Your cousin
and the king's squire.

384
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:20,468
- I was lonely and afraid.
- You had a husband.

385
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,470
A husband off whoring
every chance he--

386
00:42:22,522 --> 00:42:25,440
His sins do not
pardon your own.

387
00:42:27,477 --> 00:42:29,527
May the gods forgive me.

388
00:42:31,698 --> 00:42:33,398
Other men?

389
00:42:34,484 --> 00:42:35,784
No.

390
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:37,986
No others?

391
00:42:39,406 --> 00:42:41,239
No.

392
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:44,826
<i>Speaking falsehoods</i>
<i>before the gods is a great crime.</i>

393
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:46,378
<i>You understand this?</i>

394
00:42:46,413 --> 00:42:48,079
I do.

395
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,217
There are those
that say your children

396
00:42:52,252 --> 00:42:55,086
were not fathered
by King Robert,

397
00:42:55,138 --> 00:42:58,723
that they are bastards
born of incest and adultery.

398
00:42:58,759 --> 00:43:00,675
A lie.

399
00:43:00,677 --> 00:43:02,978
A lie from the lips
of Stannis Baratheon.

400
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:05,680
He wants the throne, but his brother's
4 children stand in his way.

401
00:43:05,732 --> 00:43:09,017
So he claims they are
not his brother's.

402
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:11,019
That filth.

403
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:14,606
There is not one shred
of truth to it.

404
00:43:14,691 --> 00:43:16,775
I deny it.

405
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,278
Good.

406
00:43:21,415 --> 00:43:24,866
But these
are terrible charges.

407
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:27,535
And the realm must know
the truth of them.

408
00:43:27,537 --> 00:43:30,005
If Your Grace has given
honest testimony,

409
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,207
your trial will prove
your innocence.

410
00:43:32,259 --> 00:43:34,709
Trial?
I have confessed.

411
00:43:34,761 --> 00:43:36,378
To a single sin.

412
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:38,380
Others you have denied.

413
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:42,183
Your trial will separate the truths
from the falsehoods.

414
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:47,722
I bow to the wisdom
of Your High Holiness.

415
00:43:49,726 --> 00:43:52,027
But if I might beg

416
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:54,646
for just one drop
of the Mother's mercy.

417
00:43:56,733 --> 00:43:59,701
I haven't seen my son--

418
00:43:59,736 --> 00:44:02,487
I don't know
how long it's been.

419
00:44:02,572 --> 00:44:04,406
I need to see him, please.

420
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:08,243
You have taken the first step on the path
back to righteousness.

421
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,080
In light of this,

422
00:44:12,132 --> 00:44:14,833
I will permit you
to return to the Red Keep.

423
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:19,054
Thank you.

424
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:21,089
Thank you.

425
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:22,557
The Mother is merciful.

426
00:44:22,592 --> 00:44:24,843
It is her
you should thank.

427
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:26,895
I will. I will.

428
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,180
I swear it,
day and night.

429
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:33,234
Good.

430
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:38,773
Am I free to go?

431
00:44:38,775 --> 00:44:41,109
After your atonement.

432
00:44:43,697 --> 00:44:45,613
My atonement?

433
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:03,501
A sinner
comes before you.

434
00:47:03,553 --> 00:47:06,754
Cersei of House Lannister.

435
00:47:08,008 --> 00:47:09,924
Mother to His Grace
King Tommen.

436
00:47:09,926 --> 00:47:13,261
Widow of His Grace
King Robert.

437
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:17,398
She has committed
the acts of falsehood

438
00:47:17,484 --> 00:47:19,684
and fornication.

439
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:22,353
<i>She has confessed</i>
<i>her sins</i>

440
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,272
<i>and begged</i>
<i>for forgiveness.</i>

441
00:47:24,324 --> 00:47:26,991
<i>To demonstrate</i>
<i>her repentance,</i>

442
00:47:27,027 --> 00:47:31,246
<i>she will cast aside</i>
<i>all pride, all artifice,</i>

443
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:34,616
<i>and present herself</i>
<i>as the gods made her</i>

444
00:47:34,668 --> 00:47:37,118
to you,

445
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,754
the good people
of the city.

446
00:47:39,789 --> 00:47:43,174
She comes before you
with a solemn heart,

447
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:45,960
shorn of secrets,

448
00:47:46,012 --> 00:47:49,964
<i>naked before the eyes</i>
<i>of gods and men...</i>

449
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:54,636
to make her walk
of atonement.

450
00:48:15,242 --> 00:48:18,326
Shame.
Shame.

451
00:48:18,378 --> 00:48:20,545
<i>Shame.</i>

452
00:48:22,048 --> 00:48:23,414

00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,755
I've had half as many
cocks as the queen.

487
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:56,140
- Bitch!
- Shame.

488
00:49:56,176 --> 00:49:58,296
- Shame.
- Sinner! Whore! Slut!

489
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,896
Shame.

490
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:06,401
Shame. Shame.

491
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:09,821
- Whore!
- Whore, whore.

492
00:50:09,856 --> 00:50:11,939
I'm a Lannister.
Suck me off!

493
00:50:11,941 --> 00:50:13,825
- Suck me off, you bitch!
- Back!

494
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,109
- Whore!
- Shame.

495
00:50:15,161 --> 00:50:17,612
Shame.

496
00:50:17,664 --> 00:50:20,998
Whore!

497
00:50:21,034 --> 00:50:24,285
Whore! Whore! Whore!

498
00:50:24,337 --> 00:50:29,374
- <i> Shame. Shame.</i>

Shame. Shame.

506
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,820

Shame.

529
00:52:57,273 --> 00:52:59,240
Your Grace.

530
00:53:04,998 --> 00:53:07,248
It's good
to have you back.

531
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:11,452
Come.

532
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:13,170
We'll take you inside.

533
00:53:13,206 --> 00:53:14,922
I need to have a look
at those feet.

534
00:53:20,129 --> 00:53:24,966
May I have the honor of presenting
the newest member of the Kingsguard?

535
00:53:40,533 --> 00:53:44,368
If it please Your Grace,
he has taken a holy vow of silence.

536
00:53:44,404 --> 00:53:46,821
He has sworn
that he will not speak

537
00:53:46,873 --> 00:53:49,657
until all His Grace's
enemies are dead

538
00:53:49,709 --> 00:53:52,577
and evil has been
driven from the realm.

539
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:01,752
Who came to your aid?
Stannis.

540
00:54:01,804 --> 00:54:02,970
Now he needs you.

541
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:04,639
We don't have enough men
to make any difference.

542
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:06,390
The wildlings will make
a difference.

543
00:54:06,426 --> 00:54:07,842
The wildlings will never
fight for Stannis.

544
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:11,262
- I told him before.
- You saved their bloody lives.

545
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:13,180
If they're gonna live
in the Seven Kingdoms,

546
00:54:13,232 --> 00:54:17,018
safe behind<i> our</i> Wall,
they ought to fight for the damn place.

547
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:20,021
- It's not their fight.
<i>-  Open the gates!</i>

548
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:40,758
Stannis?

549
00:54:46,849 --> 00:54:49,800
Shireen?
The princess?

550
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:45,606
Lord Commander.

551
00:55:45,658 --> 00:55:47,775
<i>It's one of the wildlings</i>
<i>you brought back.</i>

552
00:55:47,827 --> 00:55:49,443
<i>Says he knows</i>
<i>your Uncle Benjen.</i>

553
00:55:49,529 --> 00:55:51,162
Says he's still alive.

554
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:54,832
Are you sure
he's talking about Benjen?

555
00:55:54,867 --> 00:55:56,784
Said he was
First Ranger.

556
00:55:58,921 --> 00:56:00,871
Said he knows
where to find him.

557
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:09,714
Man says he saw
your uncle at Hardhome

558
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:11,348
at the last full moon.

559
00:56:11,384 --> 00:56:13,434
- Could be lying.
- Could be.

560
00:56:13,469 --> 00:56:14,802
There are ways
to find out.

561
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:16,804
- Where is he?
- Over there.

562
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:35,489
For the Watch.

563
00:56:40,213 --> 00:56:41,662
For the Watch.

564
00:56:44,417 --> 00:56:45,800
For the Watch.

565
00:56:47,503 --> 00:56:49,420
For the Watch.

566
00:56:50,757 --> 00:56:53,224
For the Watch.

567
00:57:37,019 --> 00:57:38,435
Olly...

568
00:57:46,395 --> 00:57:48,395
For the Watch.
