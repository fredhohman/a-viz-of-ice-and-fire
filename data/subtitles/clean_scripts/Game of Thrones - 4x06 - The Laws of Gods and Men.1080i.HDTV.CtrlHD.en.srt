1
00:00:00,573 --> 00:00:02,856
You're accused of killing the king.

2
00:00:02,976 --> 00:00:04,217
I didn't do it.

3
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:05,789
Which is why we're having a trial.

4
00:00:05,909 --> 00:00:08,011
One of my three judges is my father.

5
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:12,189
Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge.
I want you to be the third.

6
00:00:12,309 --> 00:00:15,077
I will also invite you to sit
on the Small Council.

7
00:00:15,197 --> 00:00:18,485
I never realized you had
such respect for Dorne.

8
00:00:18,605 --> 00:00:21,438
What good is power if you cannot
protect the ones you love?

9
00:00:21,558 --> 00:00:22,702
You can avenge them.

10
00:00:22,974 --> 00:00:25,082
You really believe
Tyrion murdered your son?

11
00:00:25,202 --> 00:00:27,720
You're still interested
in being queen, I take it?

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,880
It would be a great honor.

13
00:00:28,971 --> 00:00:31,260
But I will have to speak
to my father about it.

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,786
I will speak to mine.

15
00:00:32,906 --> 00:00:35,670
You started wars
to protect this family's future.

16
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,163
Tyrion deserves
for lighting our future to fire.

17
00:00:38,422 --> 00:00:40,958
What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?

18
00:00:41,078 --> 00:00:42,483
The kind who serves his king.

19
00:00:42,603 --> 00:00:44,939
The next time Ser Meryn speaks,
kill him.

20
00:00:46,064 --> 00:00:48,087
How many Hands have you betrayed,
Pycelle?

21
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:51,298
- I am loyal servant!
- Throw him in one of the black cells.

22
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:52,626
Oh no, no, no, no.

23
00:00:52,746 --> 00:00:56,909
There are many who know that without you,
this city faced certain defeat.

24
00:00:57,029 --> 00:01:01,077
The king won't give you any honors,
but we will not forget.

25
00:01:01,197 --> 00:01:04,364
The city is yours.
All these people are your subjects now.

26
00:01:04,484 --> 00:01:07,668
Sometimes it is better
to answer injustice with mercy.

27
00:01:07,788 --> 00:01:11,244
I will answer injustice with justice.

28
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:15,880
"Find a special gift."

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,382
"Theon's favorite toy."

30
00:01:18,805 --> 00:01:21,135
"He cried when I took it away from him."

31
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,232
I'm going to pick
the fastest ship in our fleet

32
00:01:24,352 --> 00:01:26,422
and I'm going to bring him home.

33
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:28,769
We need to look East for ships and men.

34
00:01:29,087 --> 00:01:30,993
- Soldiers win wars.
- We don't have any gold.

35
00:01:31,113 --> 00:01:34,799
I'm running out of time, Ser Davos,
which means you're running out of time.

36
00:03:13,956 --> 00:03:21,956

37
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:25,420
Your Grace, if you'd like
to sit, I'm sure that...

38
00:04:25,472 --> 00:04:27,723
We've been here since midday.

39
00:04:36,516 --> 00:04:39,852
Easterners have a difference
sense of time, I've often found.

40
00:04:39,854 --> 00:04:43,856
Once I was waiting for Salladhor
Saan here in Braavos.

41
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:46,525
Together, we were going to run

42
00:04:46,576 --> 00:04:49,077
three shiploads of the finest...

43
00:05:16,306 --> 00:05:18,490
Welcome to the Iron Bank.

44
00:05:18,525 --> 00:05:21,777
Please, sit.

45
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:46,885
What can we do
for you, Lord Stannis?

46
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,887
This is Stannis
of the House Baratheon,

47
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:51,156
<i>King of the Andals</i>
<i>and the First Men,</i>

48
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,126
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

49
00:05:57,981 --> 00:06:00,315
<i>The Iron Throne</i>
<i>is currently occupied</i>

50
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,234
by Tommen
of the House Baratheon,

51
00:06:02,268 --> 00:06:03,769
King of the Andals
and the First Men,

52
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:06,688
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

53
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:09,408
He shares no blood with me.

54
00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:12,828
He is a bastard born of incest.

55
00:06:12,862 --> 00:06:14,913
<i>As was his brother before him.</i>

56
00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:17,699
Yes, we have heard this story.

57
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,369
It's not a story.
It's the truth.

58
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,755
The king's grandfather
tells a different story.

59
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,174
A story about a jealous uncle

60
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:28,410
whose attempts to usurp the
throne from the rightful king

61
00:06:28,444 --> 00:06:33,382
cost the Seven Kingdoms
dearly in blood and gold.

62
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:35,133
Gold you loaned him.

63
00:06:35,135 --> 00:06:39,371
And you feel your blood gives
you a claim on our gold?

64
00:06:39,405 --> 00:06:42,024
More than any man living.

65
00:06:42,058 --> 00:06:44,977
Across the Narrow Sea,
your books are filled

66
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:48,146
with words like
"usurper" and "madman"

67
00:06:48,181 --> 00:06:50,682
and "blood right."

68
00:06:50,717 --> 00:06:53,852
Here, our books
are filled with numbers.

69
00:06:53,886 --> 00:06:56,071
We prefer the stories they tell.

70
00:06:56,105 --> 00:06:58,023
More plain.

71
00:06:58,057 --> 00:07:01,493
Less open to interpretation.

72
00:07:03,663 --> 00:07:06,615
How many fighting men
remain loyal to you?

73
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:08,000
4,000.

74
00:07:08,051 --> 00:07:10,002
<i>And how many ships do you have?</i>

75
00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:12,304
<i>The ones still afloat,</i>
<i>Ser Davos,</i>

76
00:07:12,338 --> 00:07:14,806
not at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay.

77
00:07:16,426 --> 00:07:18,176
32.

78
00:07:18,227 --> 00:07:19,978
And how much wheat
and barley and beef

79
00:07:20,013 --> 00:07:22,347
and pork do you produce
on Dragonstone

80
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:27,135
to feed your 4,000 men
on your 32 ships?

81
00:07:29,322 --> 00:07:31,156
None.

82
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:34,026
You can see why these numbers
seem unlikely to add up

83
00:07:34,028 --> 00:07:37,195
to a happy ending
from our perspective.

84
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:40,966
<i>I'm afraid we must respectfully</i>

85
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,052
<i>decline your request.</i>

86
00:07:44,087 --> 00:07:47,205
<i>But we thank you for paying</i>
<i>us the honor of your visit.</i>

87
00:07:56,182 --> 00:07:57,382
My lord.

88
00:07:57,433 --> 00:08:00,135
I'm not a lord,
Ser Davos Seaworth.

89
00:08:00,186 --> 00:08:02,304
You would not be either here.

90
00:08:02,338 --> 00:08:04,256
In Braavos,

91
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,526
thieves are not
rewarded with titles.

92
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,061
Well, strictly speaking,
I didn't do the thieving.

93
00:08:09,112 --> 00:08:10,696
That would be the pirates.

94
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,116
I just moved what they stole
from one place to another.

95
00:08:15,618 --> 00:08:17,652
This is the payment
that was demanded

96
00:08:17,704 --> 00:08:18,987
by King Stannis for my crimes.

97
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:21,406
I consider it
an honest accounting.

98
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:23,909
He's an honest man
and he's your best chance

99
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,411
to get back the money
you've sunk into Westeros.

100
00:08:26,413 --> 00:08:29,214
Which is a lot, I imagine.
Wars are expensive.

101
00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:30,582
The war is over.

102
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:33,085
As long as Stannis lives,
the war is not over.

103
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:35,087
Who's the real power
in King's Landing?

104
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:37,255
- Ser Davos...
- Humor me.

105
00:08:37,257 --> 00:08:40,892
- <i> Tywin Lannister.</i>
- How old is Tywin Lannister?

106
00:08:40,927 --> 00:08:44,329
- 67.
- 67. And when he dies, who's in command?

107
00:08:44,363 --> 00:08:46,431
A half-grown boy,

108
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:48,767
<i>the product of incest?</i>

109
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:51,603
Cersei Lannister, a queen
whose people despise her?

110
00:08:51,605 --> 00:08:54,306
Jaime Lannister, a man best
known for killing the king

111
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,441
<i>he was sworn to protect?</i>

112
00:08:56,476 --> 00:09:00,112
When Tywin's gone,
who do you back?

113
00:09:00,163 --> 00:09:02,781
That is a problem
for another time.

114
00:09:02,832 --> 00:09:05,083
Begging your pardon,
I think it's a problem for now.

115
00:09:06,452 --> 00:09:09,254
There's only one reliable
leader left in Westeros.

116
00:09:09,288 --> 00:09:11,089
Stannis.

117
00:09:11,124 --> 00:09:12,958
He's got the birthright.

118
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:15,127
He's in his prime.

119
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:16,878
He's a tried and tested
battle commander.

120
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:19,131
And he doesn't just talk
about paying people back,

121
00:09:19,182 --> 00:09:20,515
he does it.

122
00:09:24,387 --> 00:09:27,639
<i> The lookout sees a
pirate ship sailing their way.</i>

123
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:29,641
<i>The captain shouts</i>
<i>to his first mate,</i>

124
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:31,526
"Bring me my red shirt."

125
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:34,529
The first mate brings the red
shirt and the captain puts it on.

126
00:09:34,564 --> 00:09:36,481
And when the pirates
try to board,

127
00:09:36,483 --> 00:09:38,867
the brave captain leads
his men to victory.

128
00:09:38,901 --> 00:09:42,287
A few days later,
the lookout screams,

129
00:09:42,321 --> 00:09:44,122
"Two pirate ships!"

130
00:09:44,157 --> 00:09:47,959
The crew is shivering
like scared mice.

131
00:09:47,994 --> 00:09:49,961
But the courageous
captain hollers,

132
00:09:49,996 --> 00:09:51,797
"Bring me my red shirt!"

133
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:54,049
<i>After the battle,</i>
<i>the first mate asks,</i>

134
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,919
"Captain, why do you call for
your red shirt before battle?"

135
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,504
The captain replies,

136
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:03,341
"So that if I am stabbed,
you will not see me bleed."

137
00:10:03,392 --> 00:10:05,594
The next morning
the lookout screams,

138
00:10:05,645 --> 00:10:08,096
"10 pirate ships!

139
00:10:08,147 --> 00:10:10,932
"We are surrounded!"

140
00:10:11,017 --> 00:10:12,734
<i>The crew goes silent.</i>

141
00:10:12,768 --> 00:10:15,270
<i>They all look</i>
<i>to their brave captain,</i>

142
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:17,405
<i>waiting for his usual command.</i>

143
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,441
<i>Calm as ever,</i>
<i>the captain bellows...</i>

144
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:21,860
"Bring me my brown pants!"

145
00:10:24,697 --> 00:10:28,166
You think they ever met a pirate
who didn't tell them that joke?

146
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:31,620
Davos.

147
00:10:31,704 --> 00:10:34,039
I heard you were rotting in
a dungeon in Dragonstone.

148
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,374
Only half rotted.

149
00:10:38,961 --> 00:10:41,096
Join us, my friend. Join us.

150
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:44,049
This is Lhara.

151
00:10:44,051 --> 00:10:45,650
- And this is...
- I am Lhara.

152
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:51,356
She's an artist,
this one, truly.

153
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,726
No time, I'm afraid.
We sail at sunrise.

154
00:10:54,777 --> 00:10:56,194
We?

155
00:10:56,229 --> 00:10:58,396
You, me... we.

156
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:03,735
Once I thought
this man loved me.

157
00:11:03,737 --> 00:11:07,906
<i>Now I know he despises me.</i>

158
00:11:07,908 --> 00:11:12,294
He wants to see me die poor
and alone on some cold...

159
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:23,922
You won't be alone.

160
00:11:23,924 --> 00:11:25,473
And you won't be poor.

161
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:35,850
There's a chest of the good
stuff left back at your house.

162
00:11:35,902 --> 00:11:37,769
I gave it to your wife.

163
00:11:41,073 --> 00:11:43,441
You're not my friend, my friend.

164
00:11:45,244 --> 00:11:47,078
I'll see you at sunrise.

165
00:11:50,082 --> 00:11:52,334
"I give you
until the full moon"

166
00:11:52,368 --> 00:11:55,954
to order all ironborn
scum out of the North

167
00:11:56,005 --> 00:11:59,674
<i>and back to those shit-stained
rocks you call home.</i>

168
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:01,710
On the first night
of the full moon,

169
00:12:01,761 --> 00:12:04,512
I will hunt down every
islander still on our lands

170
00:12:04,547 --> 00:12:06,464
and flay them living,

171
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:09,134
the way I flayed
the 20 ironborn scum

172
00:12:09,185 --> 00:12:10,769
I found at Winterfell.

173
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:14,639
<i>In the box you'll find</i>
<i>a special gift...</i>

174
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:18,143
<i>Theon's favorite toy.</i>

175
00:12:18,194 --> 00:12:20,979
<i>He cried when I took</i>
<i>it away from him.</i>

176
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:25,150
<i>Leave the North now</i>
<i>or more boxes will follow</i>

177
00:12:25,152 --> 00:12:27,319
<i>with more Theon.</i>

178
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,371
<i>Signed Ramsay Snow,</i>

179
00:12:29,405 --> 00:12:32,824
<i>natural born son</i>
<i>of Roose Bolton,</i>

180
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:34,826
<i>Lord of the Dreadfort</i>

181
00:12:34,828 --> 00:12:37,796
<i>"and Warden of the North."</i>

182
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,798
Yes!

183
00:12:39,882 --> 00:12:41,967
<i>They skinned our countrymen</i>

184
00:12:42,001 --> 00:12:44,753
<i>and they mutilated my brother,</i>

185
00:12:44,804 --> 00:12:47,138
<i>your prince.</i>

186
00:12:47,173 --> 00:12:49,224
<i>Your prince.</i>

187
00:12:49,258 --> 00:12:52,010
<i>Everything they've done to him,</i>

188
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:54,095
<i>they've also done to you.</i>

189
00:12:54,146 --> 00:12:55,563
Yes! Yes!

190
00:12:55,598 --> 00:12:59,517
<i>As long as they can hurt
our prince with impunity,</i>

191
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,521
<i>the word ironborn means nothing.</i>

192
00:13:27,463 --> 00:13:29,381
Go left.

193
00:13:37,724 --> 00:13:40,558
- Theon Greyjoy.
- I don't know...

194
00:13:40,643 --> 00:13:41,943
I'm here for Theon Greyjoy.

195
00:13:41,977 --> 00:13:43,311
Take me to the dungeons.

196
00:13:43,362 --> 00:13:45,563
He's not in the dungeons.

197
00:14:09,922 --> 00:14:12,090
- Last cage on the right.
- Thank you.

198
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,594
<i> This way!</i>

199
00:14:30,443 --> 00:14:31,993
We're going home.

200
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:35,747
No!

201
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,920
It's all right. It's me, Yara.

202
00:14:41,954 --> 00:14:44,089
You can't trick me.

203
00:14:44,123 --> 00:14:46,291
Tell him. Tell him you
couldn't trick me.

204
00:14:46,293 --> 00:14:48,126
I'm not tricking you, Theon.
I'm saving you.

205
00:14:48,128 --> 00:14:49,511
Not Theon! Reek!

206
00:14:49,595 --> 00:14:51,296
- Reek! My name is Reek!
<i>-  They're here.</i>

207
00:14:51,298 --> 00:14:52,797
If they catch us
in here, we're trapped.

208
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,466
Help me with him.

209
00:14:54,517 --> 00:14:56,384
No, you can't!

210
00:14:56,435 --> 00:14:58,186
- You can't!
- You're Theon Greyjoy.

211
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,357
No, I don't believe her!
I know who I am!

212
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:05,643
I'm Reek! Reek! Loyal Reek!

213
00:15:05,694 --> 00:15:08,480
Good Reek!
I've always been Reek!

214
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:21,826
This is turning into
a lovely evening.

215
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:39,727
<i>I'm Reek!</i>

216
00:15:39,762 --> 00:15:41,679
Loyal Reek!

217
00:15:48,904 --> 00:15:51,105
Aah! Theon!

218
00:16:07,588 --> 00:16:10,590
Give me my broth You've got
bigger balls than he ever did.

219
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:16,345
But with those big balls
of yours...

220
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:23,519
how fast can you run?

221
00:16:35,082 --> 00:16:36,999
Make for the ship, now.

222
00:16:37,034 --> 00:16:38,701
But your brother.

223
00:16:38,752 --> 00:16:40,703
My brother is dead.

224
00:16:48,295 --> 00:16:51,180
I have a treat for you.

225
00:16:51,215 --> 00:16:52,882
A reward.

226
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:55,468
Reward?

227
00:16:56,603 --> 00:16:57,770
Yes, Reek.

228
00:16:57,805 --> 00:17:00,723
Those creatures
who came in the night,

229
00:17:00,725 --> 00:17:03,392
they wanted to take you away.

230
00:17:03,394 --> 00:17:05,361
And you didn't let them.

231
00:17:05,395 --> 00:17:07,797
You remained loyal.

232
00:17:07,831 --> 00:17:11,734
I... I didn't want
them to take me.

233
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,487
I was so scared.

234
00:17:14,538 --> 00:17:16,823
- I didn't want them...
- Yes, yes, Reek.

235
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,050
It's a bath.

236
00:17:28,085 --> 00:17:30,419
For you.

237
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:36,142
Remove those rags.

238
00:17:37,344 --> 00:17:39,178
Now.

239
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:57,780
The britches, too, Reek.

240
00:17:57,831 --> 00:17:59,448
Take them off.

241
00:19:25,702 --> 00:19:28,371
Do you love me, Reek?

242
00:19:34,261 --> 00:19:36,879
Yes, of course, my lord.

243
00:19:38,632 --> 00:19:40,132
Good.

244
00:19:40,183 --> 00:19:42,518
Because I need you
to do something for me.

245
00:19:42,552 --> 00:19:44,604
Something very important.

246
00:19:44,638 --> 00:19:47,890
There's a castle, you see.

247
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:51,027
Some bad men hold this castle.

248
00:19:52,396 --> 00:19:55,231
I need your help
to take this castle back.

249
00:19:58,785 --> 00:20:00,536
But how can...

250
00:20:02,906 --> 00:20:05,074
I need you to play a role.

251
00:20:06,243 --> 00:20:09,161
To pretend to be someone
you're not.

252
00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:14,917
Pretend to be who?

253
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:17,753
Theon Greyjoy.

254
00:21:26,323 --> 00:21:27,323
_

255
00:21:30,983 --> 00:21:32,505
_

256
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,503
_

257
00:21:33,623 --> 00:21:35,274
_

258
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,744
_

259
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:40,149
_

260
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:43,876
_

261
00:21:44,492 --> 00:21:46,924
_

262
00:21:49,163 --> 00:21:51,296
_

263
00:22:04,244 --> 00:22:05,644
He is a goatherd.

264
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,215
He says he prayed for your victory
against the slave masters.

265
00:22:09,249 --> 00:22:11,851
I thank him for his prayers.

266
00:22:27,384 --> 00:22:29,351
It was your dragons, he says.

267
00:22:29,386 --> 00:22:32,938
<i>They came this morning</i>
<i>for his flock.</i>

268
00:22:36,993 --> 00:22:39,061
He hopes he has not
offended Your Grace,

269
00:22:39,096 --> 00:22:40,729
but now he has nothing.

270
00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:43,949
Tell this man I am sorry
for his hardship.

271
00:22:43,984 --> 00:22:47,803
<i> I cannot bring back his goats,</i>

272
00:22:47,838 --> 00:22:52,658
but I will see he is paid
their value three times over.

273
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:11,260
Send the next one in.

274
00:23:19,113 --> 00:23:20,113
_

275
00:23:25,443 --> 00:23:26,443
_

276
00:23:45,262 --> 00:23:46,929
Queen Daenerys.

277
00:23:46,963 --> 00:23:49,014
Tales of your beauty
were not exaggerated.

278
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:51,100
I thank you.

279
00:23:51,134 --> 00:23:54,136
Mine is one of the oldest and
proudest families in Meereen.

280
00:23:54,171 --> 00:23:56,805
Then it is my honor
to receive you.

281
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,775
My father, one of
Meereen's most respected

282
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:02,778
and beloved citizens,
oversaw the restoration

283
00:24:02,812 --> 00:24:05,114
and maintenance
of its greatest landmarks.

284
00:24:05,148 --> 00:24:06,665
This pyramid included.

285
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,868
For that, he has my gratitude.

286
00:24:08,902 --> 00:24:10,569
I should be honored to meet him.

287
00:24:10,604 --> 00:24:12,054
You have, Your Grace.

288
00:24:12,088 --> 00:24:13,889
You crucified him.

289
00:24:16,126 --> 00:24:18,160
I pray you'll never live to see

290
00:24:18,211 --> 00:24:20,162
a member of your family
treated so cruelly.

291
00:24:20,213 --> 00:24:23,732
Your father crucified
innocent children.

292
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,219
My father spoke out against
crucifying those children.

293
00:24:27,254 --> 00:24:30,456
He decried it as a criminal
act, but was overruled.

294
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:33,826
Is it justice to answer
one crime with another?

295
00:24:33,894 --> 00:24:36,312
I am sorry you no longer
have a father,

296
00:24:36,346 --> 00:24:39,682
but my treatment
of the masters was no crime.

297
00:24:39,733 --> 00:24:42,501
You'd be wise to remember that.

298
00:24:42,535 --> 00:24:45,487
What's done is done.

299
00:24:45,522 --> 00:24:48,657
You are the queen and I
am a servant of Meereen.

300
00:24:48,692 --> 00:24:52,361
A servant who does not wish to
see its traditions eradicated.

301
00:24:52,363 --> 00:24:55,197
And what traditions
do you speak of?

302
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:57,199
<i>The tradition of funeral rite.</i>

303
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,535
Proper burial in
the Temple of the Graces.

304
00:24:59,586 --> 00:25:04,123
My father and 162
noble Meereenese

305
00:25:04,174 --> 00:25:06,508
are still nailed to those posts,

306
00:25:06,543 --> 00:25:09,712
carrion for vultures,
rotting in the sun.

307
00:25:18,922 --> 00:25:21,774
Your Grace, I ask that you
order these men taken down

308
00:25:21,808 --> 00:25:24,026
so that they might receive
proper burials.

309
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:28,230
And what of the slave children
these noble Meereenese crucified?

310
00:25:28,232 --> 00:25:30,733
They were rotting
in the sun as well.

311
00:25:30,735 --> 00:25:34,403
<i>Would you have begged me for
their right to a proper burial?</i>

312
00:25:34,454 --> 00:25:37,156
Your Grace, I cannot defend
the actions of the masters.

313
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,126
I can only speak to you as a
son who loved his father.

314
00:25:41,161 --> 00:25:43,412
<i>Let me take his body down.</i>

315
00:25:43,414 --> 00:25:46,298
<i>Let me have him brought</i>
<i>to the temple</i>

316
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:47,833
and buried with dignity

317
00:25:47,884 --> 00:25:50,252
so that he might find
peace in the next world.

318
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,142
Bury your father,
Hizdahr zo Loraq.

319
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:04,149
Thank you, my queen.

320
00:26:15,695 --> 00:26:17,129
How many more?

321
00:26:17,163 --> 00:26:20,449
There are 212 supplicants
waiting, Your Grace.

322
00:26:20,533 --> 00:26:23,285
212?

323
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,262
Send the next one in.

324
00:26:35,181 --> 00:26:37,883
These meetings aren't always going
to be this early, are they?

325
00:26:37,934 --> 00:26:41,020
I was up late last night.

326
00:26:41,054 --> 00:26:45,057
So, does this mean I am a
master of something now?

327
00:26:45,108 --> 00:26:46,975
Coins, ships?

328
00:26:46,977 --> 00:26:49,228
Lord Tywin and I
already determined

329
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,481
that I shall be the Master
of Ships long before you...

330
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,488
Lord Tywin, it's a great honor

331
00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:01,990
to have been granted a
seat on this council. I...

332
00:27:01,992 --> 00:27:03,992
<i>The trial
begins this afternoon.</i>

333
00:27:04,044 --> 00:27:06,211
We only have the morning
for affairs of state.

334
00:27:06,246 --> 00:27:07,713
Shall we begin?

335
00:27:07,747 --> 00:27:09,748
Sandor Clegane
has been spotted

336
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:12,584
in the Riverlands, my lord.

337
00:27:12,635 --> 00:27:13,969
A coward and a traitor.

338
00:27:14,003 --> 00:27:18,257
My birds tell me the Hound
slaughtered five of our soldiers.

339
00:27:18,308 --> 00:27:21,009
I believe the phrase
"fuck the king" was uttered.

340
00:27:21,011 --> 00:27:22,811
Disgraceful.

341
00:27:22,846 --> 00:27:24,680
<i>What would it take
to make the common soldier</i>

342
00:27:24,682 --> 00:27:26,982
stupid enough to try
his luck with the Hound?

343
00:27:27,016 --> 00:27:29,585
10 silver stags
seems a generous bounty.

344
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:32,438
Make it 100. What else?

345
00:27:32,489 --> 00:27:35,023
More whispers
from the east, my lord.

346
00:27:35,075 --> 00:27:36,608
The Targaryen girl?

347
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:39,445
Daenerys has taken up
residence in Meereen.

348
00:27:39,496 --> 00:27:43,098
She has conquered the city
and rules as its queen.

349
00:27:43,133 --> 00:27:44,700
Conquered with what?

350
00:27:44,751 --> 00:27:46,668
<i>She commands an army
of Unsullied, my queen.</i>

351
00:27:46,703 --> 00:27:48,704
Some 8,000 strong.

352
00:27:48,738 --> 00:27:51,039
She has a company
of sellswords...

353
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:52,424
the Second Sons.

354
00:27:52,459 --> 00:27:54,877
<i>She has two knights</i>
<i>advising her...</i>

355
00:27:54,911 --> 00:27:58,180
Jorah Mormont
and Barristan Selmy.

356
00:27:58,214 --> 00:28:00,215
And she has three dragons.

357
00:28:00,266 --> 00:28:01,683
Baby dragons.

358
00:28:01,718 --> 00:28:03,852
Larger every year, Your Grace.

359
00:28:03,887 --> 00:28:07,356
Mormont is spying on her for us.

360
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:10,359
No longer. He appears
to be fully devoted to her.

361
00:28:10,393 --> 00:28:13,395
As for Ser Barristan,
it would seem

362
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:16,064
he took his dismissal
from the Kingsguard

363
00:28:16,066 --> 00:28:17,900
a bit harder than anticipated.

364
00:28:17,902 --> 00:28:19,818
He's an old man.

365
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:21,770
He wasn't fit to protect my son.

366
00:28:21,805 --> 00:28:23,822
Joffrey didn't die on his watch.

367
00:28:23,873 --> 00:28:27,159
Dismissing him was as
insulting as it was stupid.

368
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:30,312
Don't tell me you're worried about
a child halfway across the world.

369
00:28:30,346 --> 00:28:33,916
A child with two seasoned
warriors counseling her

370
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:37,169
and a powerful army
at her back, Your Grace.

371
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,254
Lord Varys is right.

372
00:28:39,256 --> 00:28:41,757
I have been to Essos and seen
the Unsullied firsthand.

373
00:28:41,808 --> 00:28:45,327
They are very impressive
on the battlefield.

374
00:28:45,361 --> 00:28:47,095
Less so in the bedroom.

375
00:28:47,097 --> 00:28:49,932
Dragons haven't won
a war in 300 years.

376
00:28:49,934 --> 00:28:52,484
Armies win them all the time.

377
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:54,770
She must be dealt with.

378
00:28:54,804 --> 00:28:56,822
How, my lord?

379
00:28:56,856 --> 00:28:58,190
By force?

380
00:28:58,241 --> 00:29:00,259
Eventually, if it comes to that.

381
00:29:02,412 --> 00:29:05,364
Can your little birds
find their way into Meereen?

382
00:29:05,398 --> 00:29:07,416
Most certainly, my Lord Hand.

383
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:10,369
Mmm. Lord Tyrell,
be a good man.

384
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,120
<i>Fetch my quill and paper.</i>

385
00:29:33,026 --> 00:29:35,194
Prince Oberyn.

386
00:29:35,228 --> 00:29:37,646
Lord Varys...

387
00:29:37,648 --> 00:29:40,883
Only Varys.
I'm not actually a nobleman.

388
00:29:40,917 --> 00:29:43,452
No one is under obligation
to call me lord.

389
00:29:43,486 --> 00:29:45,320
And yet everyone does.

390
00:29:47,824 --> 00:29:50,292
You seem quite knowledgeable
about the Unsullied.

391
00:29:50,326 --> 00:29:52,244
Did you spend much time
in Essos?

392
00:29:52,328 --> 00:29:54,963
Five years.

393
00:29:54,998 --> 00:29:56,582
May I ask why?

394
00:29:56,633 --> 00:29:59,468
'Tis a big and beautiful world.

395
00:29:59,502 --> 00:30:02,170
Most of us live and die

396
00:30:02,172 --> 00:30:03,889
in the same corner
where we were born

397
00:30:03,923 --> 00:30:06,842
and never get to see any of it.

398
00:30:06,844 --> 00:30:09,478
I don't want to be most of us.

399
00:30:09,512 --> 00:30:11,513
Most of us aren't princes.

400
00:30:12,882 --> 00:30:16,351
You are from Essos.

401
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,238
Where? Lys?

402
00:30:20,557 --> 00:30:22,274
<i>I have an ear for accents.</i>

403
00:30:22,325 --> 00:30:23,992
I've lost my accent entirely.

404
00:30:24,027 --> 00:30:25,527
I have an ear for that as well.

405
00:30:27,413 --> 00:30:29,581
<i>How did you get here?</i>

406
00:30:29,616 --> 00:30:31,199
It's a long story.

407
00:30:31,284 --> 00:30:34,202
One you don't like
telling people.

408
00:30:34,254 --> 00:30:36,872
People I trust.

409
00:30:36,874 --> 00:30:39,958
My paramour Ellaria, she would
find you very interesting.

410
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:42,294
You should come to
the brothel and meet her.

411
00:30:42,345 --> 00:30:45,380
We brought our own wine, not
the swill they serve here.

412
00:30:45,382 --> 00:30:48,550
We have some lovely
boys on retainer, but...

413
00:30:51,454 --> 00:30:53,855
You did like boys before?

414
00:30:55,942 --> 00:30:57,809
Really?

415
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,728
Girls? Hmm.

416
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:02,397
I hope you won't be offended when
I say I never would have guessed.

417
00:31:02,448 --> 00:31:03,899
Not at all.

418
00:31:03,901 --> 00:31:06,735
But I was never interested
in girls, either.

419
00:31:06,786 --> 00:31:09,204
- What then?
- <i> Nothing.</i>

420
00:31:09,238 --> 00:31:12,040
Everybody is interested
in something.

421
00:31:12,075 --> 00:31:13,825
<i>Not me.</i>

422
00:31:13,876 --> 00:31:16,078
When I see what
desire does to people,

423
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,046
what it's done to this country,

424
00:31:18,081 --> 00:31:20,916
I am very glad
to have no part in it.

425
00:31:22,051 --> 00:31:25,387
<i>Besides, the absence of desire</i>

426
00:31:25,421 --> 00:31:28,507
leaves one free to pursue
other things.

427
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:30,225
Such as?

428
00:32:05,345 --> 00:32:08,430
Let me guess,
I've been pardoned.

429
00:32:24,647 --> 00:32:26,481
Really?

430
00:32:27,984 --> 00:32:29,484
Father's orders.

431
00:32:29,535 --> 00:32:33,321
Well, we mustn't
disappoint Father.

432
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,667
<i>Kingslayer!</i>

433
00:33:31,631 --> 00:33:34,800
I, Tommen
of the House Baratheon,

434
00:33:34,851 --> 00:33:36,551
<i>First of my Name,</i>

435
00:33:36,602 --> 00:33:38,887
King of the Andals
and the First Men,

436
00:33:38,938 --> 00:33:41,556
and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,

437
00:33:41,558 --> 00:33:45,310
do hereby recuse myself
from this trial.

438
00:33:45,361 --> 00:33:48,480
Tywin of the House Lannister,
Hand of the King,

439
00:33:48,531 --> 00:33:52,417
Protector of the Realm,
will sit as judge in my stead.

440
00:33:53,736 --> 00:33:56,371
And with him Prince Oberyn
of the House Martell

441
00:33:56,405 --> 00:33:59,691
<i>and Lord Mace</i>
<i>of the House Tyrell.</i>

442
00:33:59,725 --> 00:34:02,077
And if found guilty...

443
00:34:04,247 --> 00:34:05,997
may the gods punish the accused.

444
00:34:41,617 --> 00:34:44,002
Tyrion of the House Lannister,

445
00:34:44,036 --> 00:34:48,123
you stand accused by
the Queen Regent of regicide.

446
00:34:49,425 --> 00:34:51,793
Did you kill King Joffrey?

447
00:34:53,129 --> 00:34:54,429
No.

448
00:34:54,463 --> 00:34:56,798
Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?

449
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,267
Not that I know of.

450
00:34:59,302 --> 00:35:02,604
How would you say he died, then?

451
00:35:02,638 --> 00:35:04,806
Choked on his pigeon pie.

452
00:35:06,275 --> 00:35:08,276
So you would blame the bakers?

453
00:35:08,311 --> 00:35:10,695
Or the pigeons.
Just leave me out of it.

454
00:35:12,698 --> 00:35:16,651
The crown may call
its first witness.

455
00:35:16,653 --> 00:35:18,820
Once we'd got
King Joffrey safely away

456
00:35:18,822 --> 00:35:20,822
from the mob,
the Imp rounded on him.

457
00:35:20,824 --> 00:35:23,158
He slapped the king
across the face

458
00:35:23,209 --> 00:35:25,660
and called him a vicious
idiot and a fool.

459
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,464
<i>It wasn't the first time</i>
<i>the Imp threatened Joffrey.</i>

460
00:35:29,498 --> 00:35:31,383
Right here in this throne room,

461
00:35:31,417 --> 00:35:34,302
he marched up those steps
and called our king a halfwit.

462
00:35:34,337 --> 00:35:36,638
<i>Compared His Grace</i>
<i>to the Mad King</i>

463
00:35:36,672 --> 00:35:38,506
<i>and suggested he'd meet</i>
<i>the same fate.</i>

464
00:35:38,508 --> 00:35:40,342
And when I spoke
in the king's defense,

465
00:35:40,344 --> 00:35:42,677
he threatened to have me killed.

466
00:35:42,728 --> 00:35:44,729
Oh, why don't you tell
them what Joffrey was doing?

467
00:35:44,764 --> 00:35:47,566
<i>- Silence.</i>
- Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark

468
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,240
while you tore at her
clothes and beat her.

469
00:35:49,268 --> 00:35:51,987
Silence!

470
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:55,907
You will not speak
unless called upon.

471
00:35:57,243 --> 00:35:59,444
You're dismissed, Ser Meryn.

472
00:36:05,868 --> 00:36:08,536
Basilisk venom,

473
00:36:08,588 --> 00:36:11,089
widow's blood,

474
00:36:11,123 --> 00:36:13,375
wolfsbane,

475
00:36:13,377 --> 00:36:15,594
essence of nightshade,

476
00:36:15,628 --> 00:36:18,513
sweetsleep,

477
00:36:18,547 --> 00:36:20,632
tears of Lys,

478
00:36:20,683 --> 00:36:22,884
demon's dance...

479
00:36:25,104 --> 00:36:26,638
blind eye...

480
00:36:26,689 --> 00:36:28,890
I think you have made your
point, Grand Maester.

481
00:36:28,892 --> 00:36:30,725
You have a lot of poison
in your store.

482
00:36:30,776 --> 00:36:32,777
<i>Had,</i> Prince Oberyn.

483
00:36:32,812 --> 00:36:35,730
My stores were plundered.

484
00:36:35,732 --> 00:36:37,065
By whom?

485
00:36:37,067 --> 00:36:39,951
<i>By the accused,
Tyrion Lannister,</i>

486
00:36:40,036 --> 00:36:42,404
after he had me
wrongfully imprisoned.

487
00:36:42,406 --> 00:36:44,906
<i>Grand Maester,</i>

488
00:36:44,957 --> 00:36:47,959
you examined
King Joffrey's corpse.

489
00:36:47,994 --> 00:36:52,297
Was it without question
poison that killed him?

490
00:36:52,331 --> 00:36:54,883
Without question.

491
00:36:57,219 --> 00:37:00,755
This was found on the body
of Dontos Hollard,

492
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,374
the king's fool.

493
00:37:02,408 --> 00:37:06,428
He was last seen
spiriting Sansa Stark,

494
00:37:06,479 --> 00:37:10,231
the wife of the accused,
away from the feast.

495
00:37:10,266 --> 00:37:13,685
She wore this necklace

496
00:37:13,736 --> 00:37:15,937
<i>the day of the wedding.</i>

497
00:37:15,939 --> 00:37:19,240
<i>Residue of a most rare</i>

498
00:37:19,275 --> 00:37:23,244
and terrible poison
was found inside.

499
00:37:23,279 --> 00:37:27,248
Was this one of the poisons
stolen from your store?

500
00:37:27,283 --> 00:37:30,335
It was. The Strangler.

501
00:37:30,369 --> 00:37:34,205
A poison few in
the Seven Kingdoms possess.

502
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,843
And used to strike down
the most noble child

503
00:37:38,878 --> 00:37:41,680
the gods ever put
on this good earth.

504
00:37:49,572 --> 00:37:51,890
<i>"I will hurt you for this.</i>

505
00:37:51,941 --> 00:37:54,693
<i>A day will come when you</i>
<i>think you are safe and happy</i>

506
00:37:54,727 --> 00:37:57,145
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth

507
00:37:57,147 --> 00:37:59,314
"and you will know
the debt is paid."

508
00:37:59,316 --> 00:38:02,951
Your own brother
said this to you?

509
00:38:04,236 --> 00:38:07,122
Shortly before the Battle
of Blackwater Bay.

510
00:38:07,156 --> 00:38:11,376
I confronted him about his plans
to put Joffrey on the front lines.

511
00:38:13,913 --> 00:38:15,647
As it turned out,
when the attack came,

512
00:38:15,681 --> 00:38:17,999
Joff insisted on remaining
at the battlements.

513
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:21,920
He believed his presence
would inspire the troops.

514
00:38:23,172 --> 00:38:25,006
Tyrion said,

515
00:38:25,057 --> 00:38:27,726
"And you will know
the debt is paid."

516
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,028
What debt?

517
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,014
I discovered
he'd been keeping whores

518
00:38:33,016 --> 00:38:34,849
in the Tower of the Hand.

519
00:38:34,851 --> 00:38:37,352
I asked him to confine
his salacious acts

520
00:38:37,403 --> 00:38:40,021
<i>to the brothel</i>
<i>where such behavior belongs.</i>

521
00:38:40,023 --> 00:38:41,990
He wasn't pleased.

522
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,745
Thank you, Your Grace,

523
00:38:46,779 --> 00:38:49,080
for the courage
of your testimony.

524
00:39:04,713 --> 00:39:07,132
<i> Do you remember the
precise nature of this threat?</i>

525
00:39:07,183 --> 00:39:09,717
<i>I'm afraid I do, my lord.</i>

526
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:13,721
<i>"He said, " Perhaps you should
speak more softly to me, then.</i>

527
00:39:13,723 --> 00:39:15,640
Monsters are dangerous

528
00:39:15,691 --> 00:39:18,109
"and just now kings
are dying like flies."

529
00:39:18,144 --> 00:39:21,446
And he said this to you at a
meeting of the small council?

530
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,730
Yes.

531
00:39:22,732 --> 00:39:25,867
After we received word
of Robb Stark's death.

532
00:39:25,901 --> 00:39:28,153
He didn't seem gladdened
by the news.

533
00:39:28,204 --> 00:39:30,655
Perhaps his marriage
to Sansa Stark

534
00:39:30,706 --> 00:39:33,124
had made him more sympathetic
to the northern cause.

535
00:39:37,246 --> 00:39:39,581
You're excused, Lord Varys.

536
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:44,669
Father, may I ask
the witness one question?

537
00:39:50,509 --> 00:39:52,427
One.

538
00:39:55,598 --> 00:39:57,565
You once said

539
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,319
that without me, this city would
have faced certain defeat.

540
00:40:01,353 --> 00:40:04,939
You said the histories
would never mention me,

541
00:40:04,941 --> 00:40:07,609
but you would not forget.

542
00:40:08,944 --> 00:40:11,579
Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?

543
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:16,201
Sadly, my lord,

544
00:40:16,252 --> 00:40:18,953
I never forget a thing.

545
00:40:28,631 --> 00:40:31,099
We will adjourn for now.

546
00:40:32,468 --> 00:40:35,053
Toll the bells
in an hour's time.

547
00:40:35,104 --> 00:40:37,272
<i>Clear the court!</i>

548
00:40:57,126 --> 00:40:59,711
<i>You'd condemn
your own son to death?</i>

549
00:40:59,745 --> 00:41:01,913
I've condemned no one.
The trial is not over.

550
00:41:01,964 --> 00:41:03,464
This isn't a trial.
It's a farce.

551
00:41:03,499 --> 00:41:05,800
Cersei has manipulated
everything and you know it.

552
00:41:05,834 --> 00:41:07,252
I know nothing of the sort.

553
00:41:07,303 --> 00:41:09,804
- You've always hated Tyrion.
- He killed his king.

554
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:11,673
As did I.

555
00:41:11,675 --> 00:41:14,259
Do you know the last order
the Mad King gave me?

556
00:41:14,293 --> 00:41:17,161
<i>To bring him your head.</i>

557
00:41:17,229 --> 00:41:19,681
I saved your life so you
could murder my brother?

558
00:41:19,683 --> 00:41:22,483
- It won't be murder. It'll be justice.
- Justice?

559
00:41:22,518 --> 00:41:25,687
I'm performing my sworn
duty as Hand of the King.

560
00:41:25,689 --> 00:41:28,773
If Tyrion is found guilty, he
will be punished accordingly.

561
00:41:28,824 --> 00:41:31,392
- He'll be executed.
- No, he'll be punished accordingly.

562
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:36,998
Once you said family
is what lives on.

563
00:41:37,032 --> 00:41:39,033
All that lives on.

564
00:41:39,035 --> 00:41:42,537
You told me about a dynasty
that would last 1,000 years.

565
00:41:42,588 --> 00:41:45,456
What happens to your dynasty
when Tyrion dies?

566
00:41:46,709 --> 00:41:48,376
I'm a Kingsguard,

567
00:41:48,378 --> 00:41:50,295
forbidden by oath
to carry on the family line.

568
00:41:50,346 --> 00:41:52,046
I'm well aware of your oath.

569
00:41:52,048 --> 00:41:54,182
What happens to your name?

570
00:41:54,216 --> 00:41:57,552
Who carries the lion banner
into future battles?

571
00:41:57,603 --> 00:41:59,554
Your nephews?

572
00:41:59,605 --> 00:42:01,189
Lancel Lannister?

573
00:42:01,223 --> 00:42:03,441
Others whose names
I don't even remember?

574
00:42:03,475 --> 00:42:05,143
What happens to my dynasty

575
00:42:05,194 --> 00:42:07,412
if I spare the life
of my grandson's killer?

576
00:42:07,446 --> 00:42:10,031
It survives through me.

577
00:42:12,568 --> 00:42:14,402
I'll leave the Kingsguard.

578
00:42:14,404 --> 00:42:17,238
I'll take my place
as your son and heir

579
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,124
if you let Tyrion live.

580
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:21,626
Done.

581
00:42:23,162 --> 00:42:26,748
When the testimony's concluded
and a guilty verdict rendered,

582
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,499
Tyrion will be given
the chance to speak.

583
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:32,553
He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow
him to join the Night's Watch.

584
00:42:34,306 --> 00:42:37,091
<i>In three days' time, he'll
depart for Castle Black</i>

585
00:42:37,142 --> 00:42:38,810
<i>and live out his days</i>
<i>at the Wall.</i>

586
00:42:38,844 --> 00:42:41,429
<i>You'll remove your</i>
<i>white cloak immediately.</i>

587
00:42:41,431 --> 00:42:43,431
<i>You will leave King's Landing</i>

588
00:42:43,482 --> 00:42:45,683
<i>to assume your rightful</i>
<i>place at Casterly Rock.</i>

589
00:42:45,734 --> 00:42:48,152
You will marry a suitable woman

590
00:42:48,187 --> 00:42:51,239
and father children
named Lannister.

591
00:42:51,273 --> 00:42:55,159
And you'll never turn your
back on your family again.

592
00:43:00,282 --> 00:43:01,783
You have my word.

593
00:43:01,785 --> 00:43:03,618
And you have mine.

594
00:43:27,726 --> 00:43:29,861
Not going well, is it?

595
00:43:29,895 --> 00:43:32,363
- You're going to be found guilty.
- Oh, you think so?

596
00:43:32,398 --> 00:43:35,149
When you are, you need to
enter a formal plea for mercy

597
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,452
and ask to be sent to the Wall.

598
00:43:37,486 --> 00:43:39,454
Father's agreed to it.

599
00:43:39,488 --> 00:43:42,206
He'll spare your life and allow
you to join the Night's Watch.

600
00:43:42,241 --> 00:43:44,876
Ned Stark was promised
the same thing

601
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:46,878
<i>and we both know</i>
<i>how that turned out.</i>

602
00:43:46,912 --> 00:43:48,830
<i>Father is not Joffrey.
He'll keep his word.</i>

603
00:43:48,832 --> 00:43:50,665
How do you know?

604
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:56,387
Do you trust me?

605
00:43:59,341 --> 00:44:01,926
Keep your mouth shut.
No more outbursts.

606
00:44:01,977 --> 00:44:04,011
This will all be over soon.

607
00:44:19,945 --> 00:44:22,864
The crown may call
its next witness.

608
00:44:57,349 --> 00:44:59,400
State your name.

609
00:44:59,402 --> 00:45:01,402
Shae.

610
00:45:01,404 --> 00:45:03,621
Do you swear by all the gods

611
00:45:03,655 --> 00:45:06,207
that your testimony
will be true and honest?

612
00:45:06,241 --> 00:45:09,076
I swear it.

613
00:45:09,128 --> 00:45:10,912
Do you know this man?

614
00:45:18,587 --> 00:45:21,823
Yes. Tyrion Lannister.

615
00:45:21,857 --> 00:45:23,674
How do you know him?

616
00:45:23,725 --> 00:45:26,978
I was handmaiden
to his wife Lady Sansa.

617
00:45:27,012 --> 00:45:31,098
This man stands accused
of murdering King Joffrey.

618
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,317
What do you know of this?

619
00:45:34,937 --> 00:45:37,238
I know that he's guilty.

620
00:45:38,574 --> 00:45:40,658
He and Sansa
planned it together.

621
00:45:41,945 --> 00:45:44,445
<i>Silence!</i>

622
00:45:44,496 --> 00:45:46,998
<i>Continue.</i>

623
00:45:47,032 --> 00:45:49,951
<i>She wanted revenge
for her father,</i>

624
00:45:49,953 --> 00:45:51,452
<i>her mother, her brother.</i>

625
00:45:51,503 --> 00:45:54,288
<i>She blamed their deaths</i>
<i>on the king.</i>

626
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:56,707
<i>Tyrion was happy to help.</i>

627
00:45:56,758 --> 00:46:00,378
He hated Joffrey.
He hated the queen.

628
00:46:00,429 --> 00:46:03,447
He hated you, my lord.

629
00:46:03,482 --> 00:46:06,634
He stole poison from
the Grand Maester's chamber

630
00:46:06,685 --> 00:46:08,536
to put in Joffrey's wine.

631
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:11,105
<i>How could you
possibly know all this?</i>

632
00:46:11,139 --> 00:46:14,942
Why would he reveal
such plans to his wife's maid?

633
00:46:16,562 --> 00:46:18,996
I wasn't just her maid.

634
00:46:21,817 --> 00:46:23,484
I was his whore.

635
00:46:23,486 --> 00:46:26,487
<i> I beg your pardon?</i>

636
00:46:26,489 --> 00:46:28,155
You said you were his...

637
00:46:28,207 --> 00:46:30,041
His whore.

638
00:46:32,911 --> 00:46:35,379
How did you come
to be in his service?

639
00:46:35,414 --> 00:46:36,714
He stole me.

640
00:46:36,748 --> 00:46:38,249
I was with another man,

641
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,834
a knight in
your lordship's army.

642
00:46:39,836 --> 00:46:42,386
But when Tyrion arrived
at the camp,

643
00:46:42,471 --> 00:46:44,639
he sent one of his cutthroats
into our tent.

644
00:46:44,673 --> 00:46:49,176
<i>He broke the knight's arm</i>
<i>and brought me to Lord Tyrion.</i>

645
00:46:49,178 --> 00:46:51,679
"You belong to me now," he said.

646
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:55,683
"I want you to fuck me like it's
my last night in this world."

647
00:46:58,437 --> 00:47:01,155
Silence. Silence!

648
00:47:02,441 --> 00:47:04,075
And did you?

649
00:47:04,109 --> 00:47:06,611
Did I what?

650
00:47:06,662 --> 00:47:09,330
Fuck him like it was
his last night in this world.

651
00:47:11,366 --> 00:47:13,834
I did everything he wanted.

652
00:47:13,869 --> 00:47:15,920
Whatever he told me
to do to him.

653
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,816
Whatever he felt like doing to me.

654
00:47:18,055 --> 00:47:19,937
<i>I kissed him where he wanted.</i>

655
00:47:20,057 --> 00:47:21,459
<i>I licked him where he wanted.</i>

656
00:47:21,579 --> 00:47:24,894
<i>I let him put himself</i>
<i>where he wanted.</i>

657
00:47:24,945 --> 00:47:26,863
I was his property.

658
00:47:26,897 --> 00:47:29,115
I would wait in his chambers
for hours

659
00:47:29,149 --> 00:47:30,984
so he could use me
when he was bored.

660
00:47:31,035 --> 00:47:34,954
He ordered me to call
him "my lion," so I did.

661
00:47:34,989 --> 00:47:38,658
I took his face
in my hands and said,

662
00:47:38,709 --> 00:47:41,744
"I am yours and you are mine."

663
00:47:45,466 --> 00:47:47,000
Shae.

664
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,255
Please don't.

665
00:47:54,475 --> 00:47:56,809
I am a whore.

666
00:47:56,844 --> 00:47:59,429
<i>Remember?</i>

667
00:48:01,398 --> 00:48:03,433
That was before
he married Sansa.

668
00:48:03,435 --> 00:48:06,102
After that,
all he wanted was her.

669
00:48:06,104 --> 00:48:08,688
But she wouldn't let him
into her bed.

670
00:48:10,157 --> 00:48:12,942
So he promised to kill
King Joffrey for her.

671
00:48:24,171 --> 00:48:26,789
I wish to confess.

672
00:48:28,008 --> 00:48:31,293
I wish... to confess.

673
00:48:33,463 --> 00:48:35,965
You wish to confess?

674
00:48:37,851 --> 00:48:39,468
I saved you.

675
00:48:41,221 --> 00:48:43,522
I saved this city

676
00:48:43,557 --> 00:48:47,059
and all your worthless lives.

677
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:50,613
I should have let
Stannis kill you all.

678
00:48:50,647 --> 00:48:53,282
Tyrion.

679
00:48:56,153 --> 00:48:58,654
Do you wish to confess?

680
00:49:02,209 --> 00:49:04,794
Yes, Father.

681
00:49:04,828 --> 00:49:07,329
I'm guilty.

682
00:49:07,364 --> 00:49:10,332
Guilty. Is that what
you want to hear?

683
00:49:10,334 --> 00:49:12,468
You admit you poisoned the king?

684
00:49:12,502 --> 00:49:15,054
No, of that I'm innocent.

685
00:49:15,088 --> 00:49:19,091
I'm guilty of a far
more monstrous crime.

686
00:49:19,142 --> 00:49:22,595
I am guilty of being a dwarf.

687
00:49:23,763 --> 00:49:26,182
You are not on trial
for being a dwarf.

688
00:49:26,233 --> 00:49:28,451
<i>Oh, yes, I am.</i>

689
00:49:28,485 --> 00:49:32,688
I've been on trial
for that my entire life.

690
00:49:33,907 --> 00:49:35,608
Have you nothing to say
in your defense?

691
00:49:35,642 --> 00:49:37,042
<i>Nothing but this...</i>

692
00:49:37,077 --> 00:49:40,029
I did not do it.

693
00:49:40,031 --> 00:49:42,998
I did not kill Joffrey,

694
00:49:43,033 --> 00:49:45,334
but I wish that I had.

695
00:49:45,368 --> 00:49:48,204
<i>Watching your vicious</i>
<i>bastard die</i>

696
00:49:48,255 --> 00:49:52,341
gave me more relief
than 1,000 lying whores.

697
00:49:55,295 --> 00:49:59,715
I wish I was the monster
you think I am.

698
00:50:01,101 --> 00:50:04,687
I wish I had enough poison
for the whole pack of you.

699
00:50:04,721 --> 00:50:06,889
I would gladly give my life

700
00:50:06,891 --> 00:50:09,225
to watch you all swallow it.

701
00:50:09,227 --> 00:50:11,277
Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn.

702
00:50:11,361 --> 00:50:15,423
Escort the prisoner
back to his cell.

703
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:19,845
I will not give my life
for Joffrey's murder.

704
00:50:19,879 --> 00:50:23,098
<i>And I know I'll get</i>
<i>no justice here.</i>

705
00:50:23,132 --> 00:50:26,384
So I will let
the gods decide my fate.

706
00:50:27,804 --> 00:50:31,273
I demand a trial by combat.

707
00:50:48,474 --> 00:50:55,553
