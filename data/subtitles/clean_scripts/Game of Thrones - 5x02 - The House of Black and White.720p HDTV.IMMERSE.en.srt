1
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:40,524
In old times, whenever
Braavos stood in danger,

2
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:44,316
the Titan would step with fire in its eyes,

3
00:03:44,436 --> 00:03:48,331
wade into the sea and smash the enemies.

4
00:03:49,191 --> 00:03:51,677
It's just a statue.

5
00:03:54,577 --> 00:04:00,302
Haha. Don't be afraid. He's
announcing our arrival.

6
00:04:01,343 --> 00:04:05,060
I'm not afraid.

7
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:14,575
The House of Black and White.

8
00:05:14,695 --> 00:05:18,204
This is where you'll find
the man you seek.

9
00:05:22,368 --> 00:05:25,818
Here, I leave you.

10
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:36,941
- Thank you for bringing me.
- Any man in Braavos would have done the same.

11
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:42,532
- Valar morghulis.
- Valar dohaeris.

12
00:06:17,853 --> 00:06:19,821
Hello.

13
00:06:22,498 --> 00:06:25,294
Valar morghulis.

14
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:37,725
Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.

15
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,395
- No one here by that name.
- Please!

16
00:06:45,515 --> 00:06:48,905
I've crossed the narrow sea.
I have nowhere else to go.

17
00:06:49,025 --> 00:06:53,663
- You have everywhere else to go.
- But wait!

18
00:07:12,817 --> 00:07:16,943
Cersei...Walder Frey...

19
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:22,297
The Mountain...Meryn Trant.

20
00:07:23,412 --> 00:07:28,914
Cersei...Walder Frey...

21
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:34,193
The Mountain...Meryn Trant.

22
00:07:34,313 --> 00:07:35,705
Cersei...

23
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,381
Walder Frey...

24
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:39,077
The Mountain...

25
00:07:39,897 --> 00:07:41,269
Meryn Trant.

26
00:07:43,218 --> 00:07:44,559
Cersei...

27
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:45,997
Walder Frey...

28
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:47,681
The Mountain...

29
00:07:48,205 --> 00:07:49,502
Meryn Trant.

30
00:07:50,723 --> 00:07:51,808
Cersei...

31
00:07:53,218 --> 00:07:54,590
Walder Frey...

32
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:58,147
The Mountain...

33
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:01,460
Meryn Trant...

34
00:08:32,064 --> 00:08:34,120
Must be good food if it's crowded.

35
00:08:38,346 --> 00:08:40,934
Ale?

36
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,275
Ale?

37
00:08:57,073 --> 00:09:00,214
Before we left, a maester
gave you a raven's scroll.

38
00:09:02,736 --> 00:09:05,448
You are becoming an observant young lady.

39
00:09:05,568 --> 00:09:08,231
My mother used to say "dark wings dark words".

40
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:12,110
An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.

41
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,488
So it's good news.

42
00:09:16,608 --> 00:09:18,963
My marriage proposal has been accepted.

43
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,770
I thought you still mourned the
death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.

44
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,911
- Ale?
- I'll have some.

45
00:09:28,336 --> 00:09:31,039
My Lady...

46
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:34,313
- What is it?
- Sansa Stark. Don't look!

47
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:36,699
You sure?

48
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:38,275
She's dyed her hair, but it's her.

49
00:09:38,395 --> 00:09:40,002
She's sitting with Petyr Baelish.

50
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:41,040
Littlefinger?

51
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,652
A bunch of knights with them.

52
00:09:42,772 --> 00:09:44,885
Bunch? Bunch...Six? Twenty?

53
00:09:45,005 --> 00:09:46,394
Ten, I think. Too many.

54
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:48,442
My Lady, I don't think this is...

55
00:09:48,526 --> 00:09:49,815
Ready the horses!

56
00:09:49,935 --> 00:09:51,453
We only have one horse.

57
00:09:51,677 --> 00:09:52,887
Find more!

58
00:09:59,114 --> 00:10:00,361
Do you like the taste?

59
00:10:01,147 --> 00:10:03,080
Don't see what all the fuss is about.

60
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:06,137
Why do men love it so much?

61
00:10:06,257 --> 00:10:08,207
It gives some men courage.

62
00:10:08,605 --> 00:10:10,177
Does it give you courage?

63
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,181
That's far enough.

64
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,512
Lord Baelish.

65
00:10:18,011 --> 00:10:19,271
Lady Sansa.

66
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,508
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

67
00:10:21,628 --> 00:10:24,028
We've met, with Renly Baratheon.

68
00:10:24,926 --> 00:10:26,336
What did he say about you?

69
00:10:26,984 --> 00:10:28,057
He said,

70
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:31,987
Your loyalty came free of charge.

71
00:10:33,197 --> 00:10:36,091
Someone appears to have paid
quite a bit for it since then.

72
00:10:49,642 --> 00:10:51,077
Lady Sansa.

73
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:53,909
Before your mother's death,

74
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,104
I was her sworn sword.

75
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,734
I gave my word I will
find you and protect you.

76
00:11:00,058 --> 00:11:01,418
I will shield your back

77
00:11:01,538 --> 00:11:02,734
and keep your counsel,

78
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:05,441
and give my life for you if needs be.

79
00:11:05,946 --> 00:11:08,690
I swear it by the Old Gods and the New.

80
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,928
Please, lady Brienne.

81
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,961
No need for such formality.

82
00:11:14,535 --> 00:11:16,606
You were Catelyn Stark's sworn sword.

83
00:11:16,726 --> 00:11:18,539
- I was.
- Strange.

84
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:21,640
I knew Cat since the time we were children.
She never mentioned you.

85
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:24,137
It was after Renly's murder.

86
00:11:24,257 --> 00:11:25,459
Ah, yes.

87
00:11:25,731 --> 00:11:27,353
You were accused of killing him.

88
00:11:27,473 --> 00:11:28,775
I tried to save him.

89
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,866
- But you were accused.
- By men who did not see what happened.

90
00:11:31,986 --> 00:11:33,238
And what did happen?

91
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,125
He was murdered by a shadow.

92
00:11:40,696 --> 00:11:43,284
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

93
00:11:43,404 --> 00:11:45,607
A shadow?

94
00:11:47,053 --> 00:11:48,576
With a face?

95
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:53,340
This woman swore to protect Renly,

96
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,655
she failed.

97
00:11:54,775 --> 00:11:56,302
She swore to protect your mother,

98
00:11:57,163 --> 00:11:58,223
she failed.

99
00:11:58,678 --> 00:12:02,308
Why would I want somebody with your
history of failure guarding Lady Sansa?

100
00:12:02,428 --> 00:12:04,306
Why should you have any
say in her affairs?

101
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:05,790
Because I am her uncle.

102
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,395
I married her Aunt Lysa shortly
before my beloved's untimely death.

103
00:12:09,648 --> 00:12:12,479
We're family now. And you are an outsider.

104
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:13,670
Forgive me, Lady Brienne.

105
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,717
But experience has made
me wary of outsiders.

106
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:18,202
Lady Sansa...

107
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:20,472
- if we can have a word alone...
- No.

108
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:24,150
- Please, my Lady, if I can explain...
- I saw you at Joffrey's wedding...

109
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,453
bowing to the king.

110
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,411
Neither of us wanted to be there.

111
00:12:29,076 --> 00:12:32,045
- Sometimes we don't have a choice.
- And sometimes we do.

112
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,288
You should leave.

113
00:12:36,785 --> 00:12:39,629
We don't want our new friend
wandering the countryside alone.

114
00:12:39,749 --> 00:12:41,400
The roads in these parts aren't safe.

115
00:12:41,924 --> 00:12:43,259
Why don't you stay?

116
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,420
I'm gonna ask you to stay.

117
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:43,935
Stop! Stop! After him!

118
00:13:45,556 --> 00:13:46,579
Podrick!

119
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,017
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

120
00:14:26,454 --> 00:14:27,814
Stop!

121
00:14:30,895 --> 00:14:32,414
That's a good boy. Come on.

122
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:33,611
Come on!

123
00:14:35,969 --> 00:14:37,453
No, no, no, stop!

124
00:14:57,789 --> 00:14:59,286
Guess that means you're unarmed.

125
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,105
Don't! Put that down!

126
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:22,778
Podrick?

127
00:15:23,838 --> 00:15:24,811
Yes, my Lady?

128
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,782
You can stand now.

129
00:15:27,482 --> 00:15:28,381
Yes, my Lady.

130
00:15:32,896 --> 00:15:33,981
Sansa Stark?

131
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:37,237
Wary of strangers, as she should be.

132
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:40,119
I saw her riding on the
Eastroad with Littlefinger.

133
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,277
- We'll follow them.
- My Lady...

134
00:15:42,988 --> 00:15:45,208
if both Stark girls refused your service,

135
00:15:45,981 --> 00:15:47,491
maybe you're released from your vow.

136
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,952
I swore to their mother
I would protect those girls.

137
00:15:50,072 --> 00:15:51,352
They don't want your protection.

138
00:15:51,382 --> 00:15:52,943
You think she's safe with Littlefinger?

139
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,838
No, my Lady.

140
00:15:57,137 --> 00:15:58,572
Get your horse.

141
00:16:08,386 --> 00:16:09,945
A summons from the Queen.

142
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,618
There are only two like it in the world.

143
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:34,223
The one I'm wearing and the
one I gave to Myrcella.

144
00:16:34,713 --> 00:16:35,674
It's a threat.

145
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,383
Of course it's a threat.

146
00:16:38,094 --> 00:16:42,421
Our daughter is alone in Dorne surrounded
by people who hate our family.

147
00:16:43,448 --> 00:16:45,656
It's a threat,

148
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:48,070
No note?

149
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,017
They blame us for the death
of Oberyn and his sister.

150
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:52,917
And every other tragedy that

151
00:16:53,037 --> 00:16:54,620
has befallen their accursed country.

152
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,165
I will burn their cities to
the ground if they touch her.

153
00:16:57,285 --> 00:16:58,113
Softer.

154
00:16:58,233 --> 00:16:58,946
What?

155
00:16:59,066 --> 00:16:59,994
Not so loud.

156
00:17:00,114 --> 00:17:03,213
Our daughter is in danger and you're worried
I am speaking too loudly?

157
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,206
No one can know she's our daughter.

158
00:17:06,737 --> 00:17:08,842
Then don't call her your daughter.

159
00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:10,828
You've never been a father to her.

160
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:13,447
If I was a father to any of my children,
they'd be stoned in the streets.

161
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:14,969
And what has your caution brought?

162
00:17:16,895 --> 00:17:19,278
Our eldest child murdered
at his own wedding,

163
00:17:19,826 --> 00:17:22,172
our only daughter shipped off to Dorne,

164
00:17:23,524 --> 00:17:27,678
our baby boy set to marry that
smirking whore from Highgarden!

165
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,086
I'm gonna make things better.

166
00:17:38,206 --> 00:17:39,567
You've never made anything better.

167
00:17:39,664 --> 00:17:40,833
I'm going to Dorne.

168
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,930
And I'm bringing our daughter home.

169
00:17:43,865 --> 00:17:47,495
You can't just ask Prince
Doran to give her back.

170
00:17:47,963 --> 00:17:49,771
She's promised to his son.

171
00:17:50,008 --> 00:17:51,680
I'm not going to ask him anything.

172
00:17:52,503 --> 00:17:54,630
You go down there with an army
it's an act of war.

173
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,603
No army.

174
00:17:56,364 --> 00:17:57,960
Do you know where they're keeping her?

175
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,486
Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.

176
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:04,846
I'll find her.

177
00:18:08,145 --> 00:18:09,679
Is there anything else, Your Grace?

178
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:14,600
You're going to Dorne.

179
00:18:15,822 --> 00:18:17,606
A one-handed man.

180
00:18:18,379 --> 00:18:19,614
Alone.

181
00:18:20,605 --> 00:18:22,476
Who said I was going alone?

182
00:18:30,785 --> 00:18:33,143
No sunflowers. I don't like yellow.

183
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:35,575
Roses are very nice,
definitely roses.

184
00:18:35,695 --> 00:18:37,407
And music. I adore music.

185
00:18:37,527 --> 00:18:38,729
But no flutes.

186
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:41,660
I hate flutes. We can have a harp,
if you like, but no flutes.

187
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,660
Then there's the food.

188
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,913
The food is the most important thing,
don't you agree?

189
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:46,622
We're gonna need pigeon pies.

190
00:18:46,862 --> 00:18:49,220
That's what they eat in the capital,
don't they?

191
00:18:50,018 --> 00:18:51,627
Don't they?

192
00:18:53,392 --> 00:18:54,290
Don't who?

193
00:18:54,514 --> 00:18:57,789
People eat pigeon pie in the capital.

194
00:18:58,475 --> 00:19:00,234
They certainly do, my dear.

195
00:19:00,464 --> 00:19:01,836
They certainly do.

196
00:19:02,822 --> 00:19:04,631
It's a fine place, isn't it?

197
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:06,957
A fine place.

198
00:19:07,518 --> 00:19:11,142
I never thought I'd end up settling down
in a place like this.

199
00:19:11,765 --> 00:19:12,751
You won't.

200
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:15,077
Pardon?

201
00:19:15,314 --> 00:19:17,198
We won't get to live at Stokeworth.

202
00:19:17,318 --> 00:19:20,260
When mother dies, my sister gets the castle
because she's older.

203
00:19:20,584 --> 00:19:22,256
She hates me.

204
00:19:22,376 --> 00:19:23,856
She calls me mean names and sometimes

205
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,709
even still she pulls my hair
when mother's not looking.

206
00:19:28,914 --> 00:19:30,186
You know what I think?

207
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,631
I think you're a good person.

208
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,425
And your sister is a mean person.

209
00:19:35,545 --> 00:19:36,436
She is.

210
00:19:39,055 --> 00:19:40,340
I've been all over the world

211
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,354
and if there's one thing I've learned,

212
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,886
is that meanness comes around.

213
00:19:45,921 --> 00:19:47,368
People like your sister,

214
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:50,567
they always get what's coming for them,
eventually.

215
00:19:51,366 --> 00:19:53,050
One way or another.

216
00:19:56,574 --> 00:19:57,684
Who's that?

217
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:02,692
Jaime fucking Lannister.

218
00:20:05,118 --> 00:20:05,942
Ser Jaime?

219
00:20:06,062 --> 00:20:07,339
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

220
00:20:09,145 --> 00:20:11,253
I was very sorry to hear about your father.

221
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:12,457
Thank you.

222
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,737
This is my betrothed, Lollys.

223
00:20:17,577 --> 00:20:18,799
A pleasure.

224
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,891
Run along, love.

225
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:31,838
Beautiful young bride you've chosen.

226
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:34,189
When are you planning on getting married?

227
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,281
Just get on with it.

228
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,466
On with what?

229
00:20:36,586 --> 00:20:37,725
What you're here for.

230
00:20:38,158 --> 00:20:41,326
There's no way this little visit
could possibly mean anything good for me.

231
00:20:41,446 --> 00:20:42,574
It's very good for you.

232
00:20:55,245 --> 00:20:57,739
Lollys will be marrying Ser Willys Bracken.

233
00:20:57,964 --> 00:20:59,076
Mmm.

234
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:01,682
We've made a deal, your sister and I.

235
00:21:02,024 --> 00:21:03,705
I would have advised against that.

236
00:21:03,825 --> 00:21:04,923
How is this good for me?

237
00:21:05,043 --> 00:21:07,963
Because you're going to come with me
and help me with something important.

238
00:21:07,993 --> 00:21:09,503
And when we return...

239
00:21:09,623 --> 00:21:13,353
I'm gonna give you a much better girl
and a much better castle.

240
00:21:15,935 --> 00:21:17,860
Return from where?

241
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,781
As far south as south goes.

242
00:21:45,065 --> 00:21:47,055
<i>You are my queen.</i>

243
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,053
The prince does not
wish to be disturbed.

244
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,688
Remove yourself from my path

245
00:21:59,723 --> 00:22:01,758
or I'll take that long axe
and I'll shove it up your...

246
00:22:01,793 --> 00:22:02,882
<i>Captain...</i>

247
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:06,128
let her pass.

248
00:22:10,575 --> 00:22:12,154
Your brother was murdered...

249
00:22:12,877 --> 00:22:15,035
and you sit here
in the Water Gardens

250
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,370
staring at the sky
and doing nothing.

251
00:22:17,405 --> 00:22:19,940
Oberyn was slain
during a trial by combat

252
00:22:19,942 --> 00:22:21,653
by law, that is no murder.

253
00:22:21,655 --> 00:22:24,279
- Your brother...
- You don't have to remind me.

254
00:22:24,314 --> 00:22:27,520
He was my brother long
before he was anything to you.

255
00:22:27,903 --> 00:22:29,102
What will you know about his death?

256
00:22:29,104 --> 00:22:31,825
I will bury him.
I will mourn for him.

257
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,875
And then?

258
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,188
You would have me go to war.

259
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,933
The whole country
would have you go to war.

260
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:39,109
Then we are lucky
the whole country does not decide.

261
00:22:41,243 --> 00:22:43,110
The Sand Snakes are with me.

262
00:22:43,145 --> 00:22:44,729
They have the love of their people.

263
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:45,982
They will avenge their father

264
00:22:45,984 --> 00:22:49,953
while you sit here
in your chair doing nothing.

265
00:22:54,443 --> 00:22:55,982
Oberyn is dead.

266
00:22:56,841 --> 00:22:59,768
And this Lannister girl
skips about the Water Gardens

267
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,093
eating our food,
breathing our air.

268
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,654
How many of your
brothers and sisters

269
00:23:05,656 --> 00:23:07,340
do they have to kill?

270
00:23:08,437 --> 00:23:09,833
<i>Let me have her.</i>

271
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,863
Let me send her to Cersei
one finger at a time.

272
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,251
I loved my brother.

273
00:23:19,286 --> 00:23:21,521
And you made him very happy.

274
00:23:21,556 --> 00:23:24,438
For that, you will always
have a place in my heart.

275
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:30,135
But we do not mutilate
little girls for vengeance.

276
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,754
Not here.

277
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:33,789
Not while I rule.

278
00:23:34,883 --> 00:23:36,582
And how long would that be?

279
00:23:52,902 --> 00:23:55,101
The Unsullied are too conspicuous.

280
00:23:55,497 --> 00:23:57,831
Anyone can see them coming from a mile off.

281
00:23:58,402 --> 00:24:00,474
'Course you haven't found any
Sons of the Harpy.

282
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:02,399
You haven't, have you?

283
00:24:04,561 --> 00:24:07,002
My Second Sons
on the other hand...

284
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:11,933
they drink, they whore,
fight in streets,

285
00:24:12,435 --> 00:24:13,679
they blend in.

286
00:24:13,714 --> 00:24:16,014
They overhear things in taverns.

287
00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:19,597
Follow people from the taverns
to nice quiet alleys.

288
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:24,103
Break a few fingers,
overhear a few more things...

289
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:26,826
before you know it...

290
00:24:46,636 --> 00:24:48,073
No one here.

291
00:24:49,003 --> 00:24:50,171
We go.

292
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:51,974
In a hurry?

293
00:24:52,009 --> 00:24:52,951
You're afraid?

294
00:24:52,986 --> 00:24:55,434
Unsullied fear nothing.

295
00:24:56,054 --> 00:24:57,620
Right.

296
00:24:57,721 --> 00:24:59,132
That's your problem.

297
00:24:59,267 --> 00:25:03,430
You understood fear once, long ago,
but you forgot what it means.

298
00:25:04,272 --> 00:25:06,286
Someone who's forgotten fear...

299
00:25:06,803 --> 00:25:08,775
has forgotten how to hide.

300
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,525
Fear is useful that way.

301
00:25:44,157 --> 00:25:45,480
Sons of the Harpy...

302
00:25:45,515 --> 00:25:47,802
they want to put a collar
back on my neck.

303
00:25:48,037 --> 00:25:50,237
On all of our necks.
Please, Your Grace...

304
00:25:50,272 --> 00:25:52,672
<i>- you must kill him.
- It would send a message.</i>

305
00:25:52,707 --> 00:25:54,807
I think you should
exercise restraint...

306
00:25:54,842 --> 00:25:55,985
<i>- Your Grace.
- Why?</i>

307
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,107
Well, for one thing, he
may have valuable information.

308
00:25:58,129 --> 00:26:01,297
Well, the Son of the Harpy
has no more valuable information.

309
00:26:01,332 --> 00:26:02,473
How do you know that?

310
00:26:02,508 --> 00:26:04,211
Because I questioned him.

311
00:26:04,722 --> 00:26:07,206
And the information you did get...
he is young and..

312
00:26:07,241 --> 00:26:08,345
He is born free.

313
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,559
Why should he want
to bring back slavery?

314
00:26:09,594 --> 00:26:10,630
What did it do for him?

315
00:26:10,665 --> 00:26:12,130
Perhaps the only thing
that gave him pride

316
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,986
was knowing that there was
someone lower than he was.

317
00:26:14,021 --> 00:26:15,354
<i>They pay him.</i>

318
00:26:15,389 --> 00:26:17,589
Great families, afraid to do a thing.

319
00:26:17,624 --> 00:26:18,879
They pay poor men
to do it for them.

320
00:26:18,914 --> 00:26:19,992
And how do you know this?

321
00:26:20,027 --> 00:26:21,727
<i>- Everyone know this.
- I don't know it.</i>

322
00:26:21,762 --> 00:26:22,929
<i>And I'm the head of a great family.</i>

323
00:26:22,964 --> 00:26:25,498
<i>We do not know what
this man did or didn't do.</i>

324
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:27,733
Give him a trial at least.

325
00:26:27,768 --> 00:26:29,254
A fair trial.

326
00:26:29,903 --> 00:26:31,240
Show all the citizens of Meereen

327
00:26:31,275 --> 00:26:33,799
that you are better than those
who would depose you.

328
00:26:34,034 --> 00:26:35,226
Teach them a better way.

329
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,822
I do not know the place
from where old ser comes.

330
00:26:37,857 --> 00:26:40,668
Things maybe are different there, I hope.

331
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:44,340
But here, in Meereen,
before Daenerys Stormborn

332
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:45,907
they own us.

333
00:26:46,203 --> 00:26:48,146
So we learn much about them...

334
00:26:48,581 --> 00:26:50,326
or we do not live long.

335
00:26:50,697 --> 00:26:52,682
They teach me what they are.

336
00:26:53,149 --> 00:26:55,358
Mercy, fair trial...

337
00:26:55,393 --> 00:26:57,393
these mean nothing to them.

338
00:26:57,428 --> 00:26:59,428
All they understand is blood.

339
00:27:04,764 --> 00:27:06,267
Thank you all for your council.

340
00:27:15,345 --> 00:27:16,285
<i>Your Grace...</i>

341
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,920
a word, please, I beg you.

342
00:27:17,955 --> 00:27:18,979
About what?

343
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:20,642
About your father.

344
00:27:20,677 --> 00:27:22,677
- About the Mad King.
- The Mad King?

345
00:27:22,712 --> 00:27:24,344
You're here to remind me
of my enemies' lies?

346
00:27:24,379 --> 00:27:25,606
Consider me reminded.

347
00:27:25,641 --> 00:27:27,540
Your Grace...

348
00:27:27,575 --> 00:27:29,371
I served in his Kingsguard.

349
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,097
I was at his side
from the first.

350
00:27:32,132 --> 00:27:34,332
Your enemies did not lie.

351
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,172
Go on.

352
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:42,003
When the people rose
and revolted against him

353
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:44,534
your father set their tongues
cast them in flames.

354
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:48,120
He murdered sons
in front of their fathers.

355
00:27:48,949 --> 00:27:51,229
He burned men alive
with wildfire

356
00:27:51,264 --> 00:27:53,164
and laughed as they screamed,

357
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,651
and his efforts to stamp out dissent

358
00:27:57,869 --> 00:28:00,421
led to a rebellion
that killed every Targaryen...

359
00:28:00,906 --> 00:28:02,302
except two.

360
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:04,912
I'm not my father.

361
00:28:04,947 --> 00:28:07,485
No, Your Grace, thank the gods.

362
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:12,611
But the Mad King gave his enemies
the justice he thought they deserved.

363
00:28:12,646 --> 00:28:15,526
And each time,
it made him feel powerful...

364
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:16,835
and right...

365
00:28:17,711 --> 00:28:19,194
until the very end.

366
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:27,624
I will not have the Son of the Harpy
executed without a fair trial.

367
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,915
Your Grace.

368
00:28:42,801 --> 00:28:44,180
There's a bug.

369
00:28:44,215 --> 00:28:45,689
Yes, best be careful.

370
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,513
You might accidentally
consume some solid food.

371
00:28:48,548 --> 00:28:53,242
When I agreed to come with you,
did I misrepresent my intentions?

372
00:28:57,551 --> 00:29:02,818
Besides, what else is there for me
to do inside this fucking box?

373
00:29:02,853 --> 00:29:04,753
- You don't like it?
- I want to take a walk.

374
00:29:04,788 --> 00:29:05,957
You can't.

375
00:29:05,992 --> 00:29:09,189
Cersei has offered a lordship
to the man who brings her your head.

376
00:29:09,224 --> 00:29:11,624
She ought to offer her cunt.

377
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:13,959
Best part of her
for the best part of me.

378
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:17,909
Well, I suppose a box is as good
a place for me as anywhere.

379
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:21,237
Are we really going to
spend the entire road to Volantis

380
00:29:21,272 --> 00:29:23,372
talking about the
futility of everything.

381
00:29:23,407 --> 00:29:25,302
You're right, there's no point.

382
00:29:25,693 --> 00:29:27,778
The road to Volantis?

383
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,688
You said we are going to Meereen.
What's in Volantis?

384
00:29:30,723 --> 00:29:32,099
The road to Meereen.

385
00:29:32,134 --> 00:29:35,918
And what do you hope to find
at the end of the road to Meereen?

386
00:29:35,953 --> 00:29:37,953
I told you.
A ruler.

387
00:29:37,988 --> 00:29:40,188
But you've already got a ruler.

388
00:29:40,223 --> 00:29:42,878
Everywhere has already got a ruler.

389
00:29:42,913 --> 00:29:45,453
Every pile of shit
on the side of every road

390
00:29:45,488 --> 00:29:47,588
has someone's banner
hanging from it.

391
00:29:47,623 --> 00:29:49,410
You are quite good, do you know?

392
00:29:49,977 --> 00:29:51,363
At ruling.

393
00:29:51,978 --> 00:29:54,153
During your brief tenure as Hand.

394
00:29:54,628 --> 00:29:56,088
I didn't rule, I was a servant.

395
00:29:56,123 --> 00:29:58,640
Still, a man of talent.

396
00:29:58,675 --> 00:30:00,246
Managed to kill a lot of people?

397
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:04,428
Yes, but you showed great
promise in other areas as well.

398
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:09,844
She wanted me
to leave King's Landing.

399
00:30:10,854 --> 00:30:11,986
She begged me.

400
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:14,166
I wouldn't go.

401
00:30:14,201 --> 00:30:15,356
Why?

402
00:30:15,391 --> 00:30:16,866
'Cause I liked it.

403
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,960
Power...

404
00:30:19,995 --> 00:30:21,461
even as a servant.

405
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:24,951
People follow leaders

406
00:30:24,986 --> 00:30:26,699
and they will never follow us.

407
00:30:26,734 --> 00:30:28,734
They find us repulsive.

408
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:29,999
I find us repulsive.

409
00:30:30,034 --> 00:30:32,405
And we find them...
repulsive, which is why

410
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,298
we surround ourselves
with large comfortable boxes

411
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,777
to keep them away.

412
00:30:37,606 --> 00:30:38,832
And yet...

413
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,274
no matter what we do...

414
00:30:41,878 --> 00:30:46,379
people like you and me are never
really satisfied inside the box.

415
00:30:46,414 --> 00:30:47,698
Not for long.

416
00:30:49,203 --> 00:30:50,331
You're right.

417
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:53,404
- Let's go for a walk.
- No.

418
00:30:53,439 --> 00:30:55,978
How many dwarves
are there in the world?

419
00:30:56,669 --> 00:30:58,632
Is Cersei
going to kill them all?

420
00:31:03,418 --> 00:31:05,103
Not him.

421
00:31:05,138 --> 00:31:07,438
You're trying
to deceive your queen?

422
00:31:07,473 --> 00:31:09,573
Should I throw them
in a cell, Your Grace?

423
00:31:09,608 --> 00:31:11,248
It won't be necessary,
Ser Meryn.

424
00:31:11,283 --> 00:31:13,729
I don't want to dissuade
the other hunters.

425
00:31:14,223 --> 00:31:15,927
Mistakes will be made.

426
00:31:15,962 --> 00:31:16,726
- Thank you, Your Grace.
- Thanks.

427
00:31:16,728 --> 00:31:17,582
- Thank you, Your Grace.
- Thank you.

428
00:31:17,617 --> 00:31:18,577
Take the head.

429
00:31:18,612 --> 00:31:19,484
Let me, Your Grace.

430
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,519
I would take it
if you don't mind.

431
00:31:21,554 --> 00:31:23,554
It could prove
useful for my work.

432
00:31:24,848 --> 00:31:25,989
Very good.

433
00:31:29,111 --> 00:31:30,688
Over there would be fine.

434
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:34,233
You heard the man, over there.

435
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,947
You're the hand of the King.

436
00:32:03,982 --> 00:32:05,435
No, uncle.

437
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:08,940
Clearly, it would not be appropriate
for a woman to assume that role.

438
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:13,387
I'm merely advising my son until he comes
of age and chooses a Hand for himself.

439
00:32:13,622 --> 00:32:17,494
Your Grace, I would be willing
to serve provisionally as the King's Hand

440
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:20,158
- until he becomes full...
- You're a good man, Lord Tyrell,

441
00:32:20,193 --> 00:32:22,393
but I don't imagine
we'll have the time.

442
00:32:22,428 --> 00:32:24,643
In addition to be Master of Ships,

443
00:32:24,678 --> 00:32:27,594
the King has appointed
you Master of Coin.

444
00:32:28,931 --> 00:32:29,853
Oh, Your Grace.

445
00:32:29,888 --> 00:32:33,960
He called your experience and wisdom
in financial matters unparalleled.

446
00:32:34,307 --> 00:32:38,419
He said he would be honored to have you
represent the Crown's interest in the same.

447
00:32:38,454 --> 00:32:40,554
The honor is all mine,
Your Grace.

448
00:32:40,589 --> 00:32:43,756
<i>Y-Y-Your Grace,
in the past, on several occasions,</i>

449
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:46,448
a Grand Maester has
served as the King's Hand.

450
00:32:46,483 --> 00:32:50,947
The King's named Qyburn
the new Master of Whispers.

451
00:32:52,851 --> 00:32:54,378
Your Grace,

452
00:32:54,413 --> 00:32:58,778
this-this man?
Th-This embarassment to the Citadel?

453
00:32:59,205 --> 00:33:00,413
Your Grace...

454
00:33:00,882 --> 00:33:04,328
what qualifications can he
possibly have for this post?

455
00:33:04,363 --> 00:33:06,944
The qualification of loyalty,
Grand Maester.

456
00:33:06,979 --> 00:33:09,079
That's far more than
the eunuch ever had.

457
00:33:09,682 --> 00:33:11,669
Far more than many ever have.

458
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,220
I must say...
I can not...

459
00:33:14,255 --> 00:33:15,494
Uncle Kevan,

460
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:18,770
in light of your position as
Commander of the Lannister Armies,

461
00:33:18,805 --> 00:33:22,207
it would please the King if you
would serve as his Master of War.

462
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,153
No man living
better deserves the title.

463
00:33:25,734 --> 00:33:27,252
That is kind of you to say.

464
00:33:27,894 --> 00:33:30,159
I would like to hear it
from the King himself.

465
00:33:30,294 --> 00:33:31,759
Well, the King is very
busy at this moment.

466
00:33:31,794 --> 00:33:34,328
He should be here,
learning what it means to rule.

467
00:33:34,363 --> 00:33:35,832
He is learning.

468
00:33:35,867 --> 00:33:37,984
On this occasion,
in his capacity as ruler,

469
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:40,019
he's asked me
to speak on his behalf.

470
00:33:40,577 --> 00:33:44,462
I returned to the capital
to pay my respects to my brother,

471
00:33:44,497 --> 00:33:45,576
and to you,

472
00:33:45,611 --> 00:33:47,367
and to serve the King.

473
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:50,922
I did not return to the capital
to serve as your puppet.

474
00:33:50,957 --> 00:33:54,463
To watch you stack the
Small Council with sycophants.

475
00:33:55,472 --> 00:33:56,982
Sending your own brother away...

476
00:33:57,017 --> 00:34:00,963
My brother has left the capital
to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.

477
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:02,032
<i>What mission?</i>

478
00:34:02,067 --> 00:34:04,391
That is not your concern
as Master of War.

479
00:34:06,528 --> 00:34:09,017
I do not recognize
your authority to dictate

480
00:34:09,052 --> 00:34:11,555
what is and is not my concern.

481
00:34:11,901 --> 00:34:13,590
You are the Queen Mother.

482
00:34:14,325 --> 00:34:15,876
Nothing more.

483
00:34:19,063 --> 00:34:21,837
You would abandon your king
in his time of need?

484
00:34:21,872 --> 00:34:25,208
If he wants to send for me,
I'll be waiting for him.

485
00:34:25,243 --> 00:34:27,343
At Casterly Rock.

486
00:34:34,651 --> 00:34:36,885
Come on, you know this one.

487
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,028
It looks like an animal.

488
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:44,507
Snake.

489
00:34:44,946 --> 00:34:47,428
S-S-Sn...
"S".

490
00:34:47,463 --> 00:34:49,857
<i>- It's an "S".
- Right, very good.</i>

491
00:34:49,892 --> 00:34:52,568
Hmm, did you know

492
00:34:52,603 --> 00:34:54,323
that the youngest
Lord Commander in history,

493
00:34:54,338 --> 00:34:56,875
Osric Stark,
was elected at the age of 10?

494
00:34:58,883 --> 00:35:00,759
I know "S".

495
00:35:00,794 --> 00:35:02,479
You'll learn, I promise.

496
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:03,223
I taught Ser Davos.

497
00:35:03,225 --> 00:35:05,503
Old people are terrible
at learning new things.

498
00:35:05,538 --> 00:35:07,692
Well, you are a wonderful teacher.

499
00:35:09,211 --> 00:35:10,422
Very patient.

500
00:35:10,457 --> 00:35:13,364
I only said that the more
time that you spend practicing

501
00:35:13,399 --> 00:35:14,464
<i>the faster you will
be able to read.</i>

502
00:35:14,499 --> 00:35:15,912
That's all right.

503
00:35:16,235 --> 00:35:17,566
We're doing just fine.

504
00:35:17,601 --> 00:35:21,948
I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark
have a lot to talk about.

505
00:35:25,025 --> 00:35:27,325
How old were you
when you learned how to read?

506
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,959
<i>- 3.
- 3?</i>

507
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:30,493
Were you taught by your mother?

508
00:35:31,204 --> 00:35:32,283
No.

509
00:35:32,318 --> 00:35:34,218
Our Maester Cressen did.

510
00:35:34,253 --> 00:35:37,687
I had a lot of time to practice.
My mother kept me inside because...

511
00:35:40,435 --> 00:35:44,540
What do you call it in the south?
What happened to your face.

512
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,534
Grayscale.

513
00:35:46,569 --> 00:35:48,449
What would you call it
in the north of the Wall?

514
00:35:49,115 --> 00:35:50,529
I don't know.

515
00:35:51,273 --> 00:35:54,599
But two of my sisters had it.
They both died.

516
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,335
How did they cure you?

517
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:58,955
I don't remember.
I was a baby.

518
00:35:59,175 --> 00:36:01,392
A lot of people came and tried, I think.

519
00:36:01,427 --> 00:36:03,730
Whatever they did, it went away.

520
00:36:05,542 --> 00:36:07,172
What happened to your sisters?

521
00:36:09,455 --> 00:36:13,569
My father made them move out
to the keep, outside.

522
00:36:14,258 --> 00:36:16,192
None of us were allowed
to go near them.

523
00:36:16,562 --> 00:36:20,584
But we heard them,
especially at night.

524
00:36:21,126 --> 00:36:25,480
They started to sound
not like themselves.

525
00:36:26,115 --> 00:36:27,484
Did you ever see them?

526
00:36:28,627 --> 00:36:30,259
Only once, at the end.

527
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:33,595
They were covered with it.

528
00:36:34,834 --> 00:36:40,081
Their faces, their arms,
they acted like animals.

529
00:36:41,382 --> 00:36:44,300
My father had to drag them out
to the woods on a rope.

530
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,002
What did he do with
them in the woods?

531
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,781
Mother.

532
00:36:54,311 --> 00:36:55,587
Leave us.

533
00:36:58,801 --> 00:36:59,992
Your Grace.

534
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,380
You need to stay
away from that girl.

535
00:37:03,415 --> 00:37:04,933
- Why?
- She's a wildling.

536
00:37:04,968 --> 00:37:06,214
Her name's Gilly.

537
00:37:06,249 --> 00:37:08,049
She's nice.
I'm teaching her to read.

538
00:37:08,084 --> 00:37:11,337
She's a wildling.
Your father defeated her people.

539
00:37:11,372 --> 00:37:13,989
He executed their king
for treason.

540
00:37:14,281 --> 00:37:17,260
They could strike at him
by striking at you.

541
00:37:17,295 --> 00:37:18,966
Gilly wouldn't do that.

542
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,688
You have no idea
what people will do.

543
00:37:23,807 --> 00:37:26,019
All your books
and you still don't know.

544
00:37:32,118 --> 00:37:34,812
I ordered Mance Rayder
burned at the stake.

545
00:37:34,847 --> 00:37:37,147
You prevented that order
from being carried out.

546
00:37:37,182 --> 00:37:39,682
You showed mercy
to Mance Rayder.

547
00:37:39,844 --> 00:37:41,507
The King's word is law.

548
00:37:42,314 --> 00:37:46,155
Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos
how much mercy I show to lawbreakers.

549
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:51,883
Show too much kindness,
people won't fear you.

550
00:37:51,918 --> 00:37:54,018
If they don't fear you,
they don't follow you.

551
00:37:54,841 --> 00:37:57,241
With respect, Your Grace,
the free folk will never follow you

552
00:37:57,245 --> 00:37:58,581
no matter what you do.

553
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,756
You're the man
who burned their king alive.

554
00:38:02,345 --> 00:38:03,591
Who then?

555
00:38:05,665 --> 00:38:07,035
You?

556
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:10,260
No.
Only one of their own.

557
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:13,995
Do you know this wretched girl?

558
00:38:15,555 --> 00:38:18,096
- Lyanna Mormont.
- Lord Commander's niece.

559
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,955
Lady of Bear Island.

560
00:38:20,325 --> 00:38:21,912
And a child of ten.

561
00:38:23,485 --> 00:38:26,361
I asked her to commit her house
to my court. That's her response.

562
00:38:26,617 --> 00:38:29,790
Bear Island knows no king
but the King in the North,

563
00:38:29,825 --> 00:38:31,810
whose name is Stark.

564
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:34,008
That amuses you.

565
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,350
I apologize, Your Grace.

566
00:38:38,446 --> 00:38:41,989
Northerners commit
a bit like the free folk.

567
00:38:42,931 --> 00:38:44,426
Loyal to their own.

568
00:38:44,843 --> 00:38:45,957
I know.

569
00:38:45,992 --> 00:38:49,159
My brother, Robert, went on often
and loudly about how difficult it was

570
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:50,690
to control them.

571
00:38:52,713 --> 00:38:54,710
Even with your father's help.

572
00:38:57,481 --> 00:39:00,688
Tonight, the Night's Watch
elect a new Lord Commander.

573
00:39:01,566 --> 00:39:03,301
Ser Alliser Thorne
is going to win.

574
00:39:03,336 --> 00:39:05,355
- Most likely.
- One pleasant man.

575
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:07,349
He thinks you're a traitor.

576
00:39:08,536 --> 00:39:10,051
What's your life gonna
be like here at the Wall,

577
00:39:10,086 --> 00:39:12,896
- with Thorne in command?
- Unpleasant, I expect.

578
00:39:12,931 --> 00:39:14,733
Your bravery made him look weak.

579
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,653
He'll punish you for it.

580
00:39:17,941 --> 00:39:19,863
I don't punish men for bravery.

581
00:39:19,898 --> 00:39:21,392
I reward them.

582
00:39:21,812 --> 00:39:23,527
I don't doubt that, Your Grace.

583
00:39:24,775 --> 00:39:26,528
But I am a brother
of the Night's Watch.

584
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,478
I have pledged them my life,
my honor, my sword.

585
00:39:29,713 --> 00:39:31,613
I don't know what
I have left to give you.

586
00:39:31,648 --> 00:39:33,427
You can give me the North.

587
00:39:34,862 --> 00:39:35,980
I can't.

588
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:39,827
Even if I wanted to,
I'm a bastard.

589
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:41,280
A Snow.

590
00:39:41,825 --> 00:39:44,440
Kneel before me.
Lay your sword at my feet.

591
00:39:44,475 --> 00:39:47,339
Pledge me your service
and you'll rise again as Jon Stark,

592
00:39:47,374 --> 00:39:48,889
Lord of Winterfell.

593
00:39:54,667 --> 00:39:57,076
He'll make you a Stark
with a stroke of a pen.

594
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,729
It's the first thing
I ever remember wanting.

595
00:40:01,161 --> 00:40:03,968
I daydreamed that my father
would ask the king.

596
00:40:04,003 --> 00:40:06,401
Just like that I would never be
the Bastard of Winterfell again.

597
00:40:06,436 --> 00:40:09,436
No, you deserve that.
You do.

598
00:40:09,471 --> 00:40:11,630
I-I couldn't be happier for you.

599
00:40:12,651 --> 00:40:14,193
I'm gonna refuse him.

600
00:40:16,226 --> 00:40:17,465
But...

601
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,495
you'd be Lord of Winterfell.

602
00:40:20,115 --> 00:40:22,296
I swore a vow
to the Night's Watch.

603
00:40:22,499 --> 00:40:24,102
If I don't take
my own word seriously,

604
00:40:24,137 --> 00:40:26,337
what sort of Lord of Winterfell
would that be?

605
00:40:30,078 --> 00:40:31,033
<i>Hey.</i>

606
00:40:31,525 --> 00:40:34,710
Crowded,
You'd think we were serving venison stew.

607
00:40:41,682 --> 00:40:46,127
Does anyone wish to speak
for candidates...

608
00:40:46,555 --> 00:40:48,836
before we cast our tokens...

609
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:55,336
for the 998th Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch?

610
00:40:57,735 --> 00:40:59,543
Ser Alliser Thorne
is not just a knight,

611
00:40:59,578 --> 00:41:01,430
he's a man of true nobility.

612
00:41:01,465 --> 00:41:04,583
<i>He was Acting Commander
when the Wall came under attack</i>

613
00:41:04,618 --> 00:41:06,118
and led us to victory
against the wildlings.

614
00:41:06,153 --> 00:41:07,103
<i>Yes.</i>

615
00:41:07,138 --> 00:41:08,592
He's a veteran of 100 battles

616
00:41:08,627 --> 00:41:12,009
and has been a defender of the Watch
and the Wall almost all of his life.

617
00:41:12,044 --> 00:41:13,208
<i>Nice.</i>

618
00:41:13,855 --> 00:41:15,661
<i>- He's the only true choice.
- Yes.</i>

619
00:41:15,696 --> 00:41:17,609
<i>Yes.</i>

620
00:41:20,047 --> 00:41:22,745
Ser Denys Mallister
joined the Watch as a boy

621
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,901
and has served loyally
longer than any other Ranger.

622
00:41:25,936 --> 00:41:28,466
<i>- That's right.
- Through ten winters he served.</i>

623
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,427
As Commander of the Shadow Tower...

624
00:41:30,547 --> 00:41:32,461
he kept the wildlings away.

625
00:41:32,581 --> 00:41:34,196
We could do no better.

626
00:41:38,367 --> 00:41:40,102
If there's no one else...

627
00:41:40,222 --> 00:41:42,081
we will begin the voting.

628
00:41:42,529 --> 00:41:47,031
The triangular tokens count
for Ser Alliser Thorne.

629
00:41:47,343 --> 00:41:51,202
The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister.

630
00:41:51,631 --> 00:41:53,678
Maester Aemon...

631
00:41:55,295 --> 00:41:58,502
Samwell Tarly, go on.

632
00:41:59,538 --> 00:42:00,997
Sam the Slayer.

633
00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:05,631
Another wildling lover,
just like his friend, Jon Snow.

634
00:42:06,074 --> 00:42:07,620
How's your lady love, Slayer?

635
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:10,015
Her name is Gilly.

636
00:42:10,676 --> 00:42:12,385
Ser Slynt knows her quite well.

637
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:15,463
They cowered together in the larder
during the battle for the Wall.

638
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,144
Lies!

639
00:42:17,264 --> 00:42:19,973
A wildling girl, a baby,

640
00:42:20,434 --> 00:42:22,081
and Lord Janos.

641
00:42:22,917 --> 00:42:24,757
I found him there after
the battle was over.

642
00:42:24,877 --> 00:42:26,179
In a puddle of his own making.

643
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,941
Whilst Lord Janos was hiding
with the women and children

644
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:37,099
Jon Snow was leading.

645
00:42:38,324 --> 00:42:40,248
Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true,

646
00:42:40,368 --> 00:42:42,563
but when he was wounded,
it was Jon who saved us.

647
00:42:42,915 --> 00:42:45,205
He took charge of the Wall's defense,

648
00:42:45,325 --> 00:42:47,300
he killed the Magnar of the Thenns,

649
00:42:47,958 --> 00:42:50,199
he went North to deal with Mance Rayder.

650
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:53,269
Knowing it would almost certainly mean
his own death.

651
00:42:56,704 --> 00:42:57,971
Before that,

652
00:42:59,092 --> 00:43:02,844
he led the mission to avenge
Lord Commander Mormont.

653
00:43:04,224 --> 00:43:06,943
Mormont himself chose
Jon to be his steward.

654
00:43:07,255 --> 00:43:08,702
He saw something in Jon.

655
00:43:08,822 --> 00:43:10,672
And now we've all seen it too.

656
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:12,666
He may be young,

657
00:43:13,938 --> 00:43:15,977
but he's the commander we turned to

658
00:43:16,097 --> 00:43:17,773
when the night was darkest.

659
00:43:17,893 --> 00:43:19,305
Yeah!

660
00:43:25,455 --> 00:43:26,615
Aye.

661
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:28,873
Can't argue with any of that.

662
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,391
But who does Jon Snow want to command?

663
00:43:32,852 --> 00:43:34,161
The Night's Watch?

664
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:37,255
Or the wildlings?

665
00:43:38,084 --> 00:43:41,427
Everyone knows he loved
a wildling girl.

666
00:43:41,547 --> 00:43:43,360
He spoke with Mance Rayder many times.

667
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,850
What would have happened in that tent
between those two old friends

668
00:43:47,399 --> 00:43:49,332
if Stannis's army hadn't come along?

669
00:43:49,614 --> 00:43:54,152
We all saw him put the King-Beyond-the-Wall
out of his misery.

670
00:43:54,417 --> 00:43:57,567
Do you want to choose a man who has fought
the wildlings all his life

671
00:43:58,474 --> 00:44:00,645
or a man who makes love to them?

672
00:44:08,469 --> 00:44:09,916
It is time!

673
00:44:56,712 --> 00:44:59,326
Appears to be a tie, maester.

674
00:45:19,788 --> 00:45:21,632
Jon Snow! Jon Snow!

675
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:24,071
Jon Snow! Jon Snow!

676
00:45:24,191 --> 00:45:26,212
Jon Snow! Jon Snow!

677
00:45:53,948 --> 00:45:56,384
You! You!

678
00:46:00,071 --> 00:46:01,265
What have you got there?

679
00:46:04,432 --> 00:46:07,015
- I said...
- Turn around and go!

680
00:46:09,305 --> 00:46:10,889
Turn around...

681
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:13,666
- and go!
- That's a nice little sword.

682
00:46:14,007 --> 00:46:16,200
Worth a hundred pigeons a sword like that.

683
00:46:18,636 --> 00:46:20,805
Nothing's worth anything to dead men.

684
00:46:24,825 --> 00:46:26,165
Quickly, go! Go!

685
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,096
Who are you?

686
00:46:42,022 --> 00:46:43,679
Why were they scared of you?

687
00:46:43,799 --> 00:46:45,238
You lost this.

688
00:46:56,739 --> 00:46:58,713
You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.

689
00:46:59,054 --> 00:47:00,272
There isn't.

690
00:47:00,392 --> 00:47:02,489
A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.

691
00:47:05,169 --> 00:47:06,899
Who are you then?

692
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,360
No one.

693
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:11,626
And that is who a girl must become.

694
00:48:01,156 --> 00:48:02,902
_

695
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:06,494

696
00:48:07,118 --> 00:48:09,982
_

697
00:48:23,222 --> 00:48:25,597
Why?

698
00:48:26,115 --> 00:48:28,399
_

699
00:48:30,348 --> 00:48:33,028

700
00:48:34,216 --> 00:48:36,196

703
00:48:43,286 --> 00:48:44,408

704
00:48:44,528 --> 00:48:48,741

705
00:48:48,861 --> 00:48:51,307

706
00:48:51,556 --> 00:48:53,864
_

707
00:48:53,984 --> 00:48:56,184

708
00:48:57,942 --> 00:49:01,201

711
00:49:11,412 --> 00:49:14,610
_

712
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:19,178
_

713
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:25,018
_

714
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:30,183

715
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,703

716
00:49:37,657 --> 00:49:41,586

717
00:49:42,814 --> 00:49:46,012

718
00:49:46,132 --> 00:49:47,415

719
00:49:47,535 --> 00:49:49,096
_

720
00:49:54,066 --> 00:49:55,820
_

721
00:50:05,987 --> 00:50:07,472
Mhysa!

722
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:29,040
Mhysa!

723
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,286
Mhysa!

724
00:50:31,406 --> 00:50:33,989
Mhysa! Mhysa!

725
00:50:35,479 --> 00:50:38,640
She should have cut the traitor's head
in the Great Pyramid and be done with it.

726
00:50:38,877 --> 00:50:40,823
That's what I keep telling
her to do to you.

727
00:50:46,522 --> 00:50:47,894
Mhysa!

728
00:50:48,014 --> 00:50:50,564
_

729
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,083

00:51:16,235 --> 00:51:18,443

733
00:51:25,641 --> 00:51:28,373

734
00:51:29,496 --> 00:51:30,943

735
00:51:34,723 --> 00:51:39,900

736
00:51:40,271 --> 00:51:42,616

737
00:51:42,878 --> 00:51:45,023
_

738
00:52:05,557 --> 00:52:06,817
Mhysa!

739
00:52:43,057 --> 00:52:44,714
Mhysa!

740
00:53:48,005 --> 00:53:50,514
l'll stand guard outside
your door tonight, Your Grace.

741
00:53:50,634 --> 00:53:52,381
We all guard tonight.

742
00:53:53,472 --> 00:53:54,829
Leave me.

743
00:54:47,783 --> 00:54:49,499
Drogon!

744
00:55:13,125 --> 00:55:15,227
Shh...
