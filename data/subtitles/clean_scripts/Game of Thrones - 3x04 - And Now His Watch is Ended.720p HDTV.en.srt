1
00:00:00,645 --> 00:00:01,979
Why you help us?

2
00:00:02,099 --> 00:00:03,802
He takes us prisoner
and now he's our friend?

3
00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:05,407
You're not our
prisoner, little lady.

4
00:00:05,441 --> 00:00:06,810
You're lucky we found you.

5
00:00:06,844 --> 00:00:08,948
These woods aren't safe
for Ned Stark's daughter.

6
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:11,922
Ride east. Your sister's
waiting for you.

7
00:00:11,957 --> 00:00:13,793
Come on.
Come on.

8
00:00:13,828 --> 00:00:15,464
I'm waiting for word
on an assignment

9
00:00:15,498 --> 00:00:17,402
that will take me far away
from the capital.

10
00:00:17,436 --> 00:00:20,842
- I might be able to take you with me.
- Watch out for her.

11
00:00:20,876 --> 00:00:22,579
Watch out for her with him.

12
00:00:22,613 --> 00:00:25,719
The Lord of Harrenhal will make a
worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.

13
00:00:25,753 --> 00:00:29,461
- My lord. - You'll leave for the Eyrie
as soon as possible.

14
00:00:29,495 --> 00:00:32,434
I'm Jojen Reed.
This is my sister Meera.

15
00:00:32,468 --> 00:00:34,638
We've come a long way
to find you, Brandon.

16
00:00:34,673 --> 00:00:36,576
And we have much farther to go.

17
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,582
What have we here?
Frozen crows?

18
00:00:39,616 --> 00:00:42,722
Bet you feed that pig
better than you feed us.

19
00:00:42,756 --> 00:00:44,392
That pig's got value to me.

20
00:00:45,396 --> 00:00:48,032
What is it?

21
00:00:51,307 --> 00:00:53,242
Yah!

22
00:00:56,449 --> 00:00:57,917
Come, my lord.

23
00:00:57,951 --> 00:01:00,221
You're a long way from home
and winter is coming.

24
00:01:00,255 --> 00:01:02,257
I want to buy them all.
8,000.

25
00:01:02,292 --> 00:01:05,397
Master Kraznys says
you cannot afford this.

26
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,401
I have dragons.

27
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:10,473
- They want the biggest one.
- Done.

28
00:01:10,507 --> 00:01:12,811
I'll take you as well, now.

29
00:01:12,845 --> 00:01:16,384
You think you're
the smartest man there is.

30
00:01:16,419 --> 00:01:17,653
And if you get in any trouble,

31
00:01:17,687 --> 00:01:20,658
all you've got to do
is say "my father."

32
00:01:20,693 --> 00:01:23,029
You're nothing
without your daddy.

33
00:01:23,063 --> 00:01:24,498
Never forget that.

34
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:27,604
Here, this should
help you remember.

35

00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,943
How many of those fingers

37
00:03:36,977 --> 00:03:39,378
do you think we could
shove up his ass?

38
00:03:39,413 --> 00:03:41,147
Depends if he's
had any practice.

39
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:45,150
Is that the sort of thing you and
your sister go in for, Kingslayer?

40
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:48,920
She loosened you up for us?

41
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,361
He's going to fall.

42
00:03:57,395 --> 00:03:59,997
He's going to fall off his horse.
Someone help him.

43
00:04:09,238 --> 00:04:11,072
Water.

44
00:04:11,106 --> 00:04:13,107
Water.

45
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:15,742
Please, water.

46
00:04:16,611 --> 00:04:18,278
Wa-water.

47
00:04:18,312 --> 00:04:19,946
Water, please.

48
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,880
Please. Please.

49
00:04:29,455 --> 00:04:31,422
If I die,
you won't be getting--

50
00:04:31,457 --> 00:04:32,890
Oh, enough.

51
00:04:32,924 --> 00:04:35,025
Here.

52
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:44,232
Can't say that I've ever seen a
man drink horse piss that fast.

53
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:13,525
Stop!

54
00:05:21,299 --> 00:05:22,832
Far enough.

55
00:05:53,157 --> 00:05:56,860
Do that again
and I'll take your other hand.

56
00:06:00,698 --> 00:06:03,099
Come on, you.

57
00:06:12,942 --> 00:06:15,409
Oh, Lord Tyrion.
Come in, come in.

58
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:17,545
I hope we might speak.

59
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,247
In confidence.

60
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:23,183
Oh, always in confidence.

61
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:24,952
About the events
of the Blackwater.

62
00:06:26,588 --> 00:06:27,954
Perhaps this is the wrong time?

63
00:06:27,989 --> 00:06:29,857
Oh, no.
It's a wonderful time.

64
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:32,559
I thought one
of your little birds

65
00:06:32,594 --> 00:06:35,361
might have knowledge of
my sister's intentions to--

66
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:36,863
End your life?

67
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,732
I didn't inherit
Littlefinger's spies

68
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,300
along with his position,
I'm afraid.

69
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,368
Which is why I'm coming to you.

70
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,637
- I need proof.
- Proof?

71
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,072
- Will there be a trial?
- I need to know.

72
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:52,209
I have no proof, only whispers.

73
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,815
Before all this nastiness,

74
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:02,418
I was going to tell you
the story of how I was cut.

75
00:07:02,453 --> 00:07:04,154
Do you want to hear it still?

76
00:07:04,188 --> 00:07:06,589
I don't know.
Do I?

77
00:07:06,623 --> 00:07:09,358
As a boy, I travelled
with a troupe of actors

78
00:07:09,392 --> 00:07:11,360
through the Free Cities.

79
00:07:11,395 --> 00:07:13,162
One day in Myr,

80
00:07:13,196 --> 00:07:16,031
a certain man
made my master an offer

81
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:18,133
too tempting to refuse.

82
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:20,735
I feared the man meant
to use me as I'd heard

83
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:22,770
some men used small boys.

84
00:07:22,804 --> 00:07:25,506
But what he wanted
was far worse.

85
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:28,175
He gave me a potion

86
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:30,310
that made me powerless
to move or speak,

87
00:07:30,344 --> 00:07:33,346
yet did nothing
to dull my senses.

88
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,781
With a hooked blade
he sliced me,

89
00:07:35,816 --> 00:07:38,751
root and stem,
chanting all the while.

90
00:07:38,785 --> 00:07:42,387
He burned my parts
in a brazier.

91
00:07:42,422 --> 00:07:43,956
The flames turned blue

92
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,659
and I heard a voice
answer his call.

93
00:07:52,564 --> 00:07:56,166
I still dream of that night.

94
00:07:56,201 --> 00:07:58,635
Not of the sorcerer,

95
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,937
not of his blade.

96
00:08:00,972 --> 00:08:03,406
I dream of the voice
from the flames.

97
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,642
Was it a god?
A demon?

98
00:08:05,676 --> 00:08:07,344
A conjuror's trick?

99
00:08:07,378 --> 00:08:09,512
I don't know.

100
00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:13,016
But the sorcerer called
and a voice answered.

101
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,451
And ever since that day,

102
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:19,255
I have hated magic and
all those who practice it.

103
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:21,691
But you can see
why I was eager to aid

104
00:08:21,725 --> 00:08:25,093
in your fight against
Stannis and his Red Priestess.

105
00:08:25,128 --> 00:08:28,830
A symbolic revenge of sorts.

106
00:08:28,864 --> 00:08:32,900
Yes, ahem. I feel the
need for actual revenge

107
00:08:32,934 --> 00:08:34,935
against the actual person

108
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:37,469
who tried to have me killed.

109
00:08:37,504 --> 00:08:40,839
Which will require a degree
of influence, which--

110
00:08:40,873 --> 00:08:43,207
You do not possess

111
00:08:43,242 --> 00:08:45,943
at the moment.

112
00:08:45,978 --> 00:08:48,279
But influence is largely

113
00:08:48,313 --> 00:08:51,448
a matter of patience,
I have found.

114
00:08:51,482 --> 00:08:54,851
Once I had served
the sorcerer's purpose,

115
00:08:54,885 --> 00:08:57,453
he threw me out
of his house to die.

116
00:08:57,488 --> 00:09:00,223
I resolved to live

117
00:09:00,257 --> 00:09:01,690
to spite him.

118
00:09:01,725 --> 00:09:03,258
I begged.

119
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,494
I sold what parts
of my body remained to me.

120
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:08,863
I became an excellent thief

121
00:09:08,897 --> 00:09:12,265
and soon learned that the
contents of a man's letters

122
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,368
are more valuable than the
contents of his purse.

123
00:09:16,403 --> 00:09:18,838
Step by step,

124
00:09:18,872 --> 00:09:21,640
one distasteful task
after another,

125
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:25,143
I made my way
from the slums of Myr

126
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:28,413
to the small council chamber.

127
00:09:30,383 --> 00:09:33,284
Influence grows like a weed.

128
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:37,054
I tended mine patiently

129
00:09:37,088 --> 00:09:40,457
until its tendrils
reached from the Red Keep

130
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:43,827
all the way across
to the far side of the world

131
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:47,797
where I managed to wrap
them around something

132
00:09:47,831 --> 00:09:49,932
very special.

133
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:57,605
The sorcerer.

134
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:01,074
Hello, my old friend.

135
00:10:01,108 --> 00:10:04,276
It's been a long time.

136
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:07,479
I have no doubt
the revenge you want

137
00:10:07,514 --> 00:10:09,081
will be yours in time...

138
00:10:09,115 --> 00:10:12,150
if you have the stomach for it.

139
00:10:15,154 --> 00:10:17,554
When people talk about
the Night's Watch,

140
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:20,023
they never mention
the shoveling.

141
00:10:20,058 --> 00:10:22,292
Or the shit.

142
00:10:22,326 --> 00:10:25,027
They tell you about honor,
pardoning crimes,

143
00:10:25,061 --> 00:10:26,461
and protecting the realm,

144
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:30,831
but shoveling
really is most of it.

145
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:34,568
And getting attacked
or killed or worse.

146
00:10:34,602 --> 00:10:37,070
And that. But when you're not
getting attacked or killed,

147
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:38,404
usually you're shoveling.

148
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:41,207
Oh, look.

149
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,975
More shit.

150
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,910
I was starting
to wonder what to do

151
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,712
with the rest of my day.

152
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,081
We need to get out of here.

153
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:53,617
When the Lord Commander
says we go, we go.

154
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:56,586
The Lord Commander told us to go
to the Fist of the First Men.

155
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:59,421
- How'd that turn out for us?
- He had no way of knowing.

156
00:10:59,456 --> 00:11:00,923
We do now.

157
00:11:00,957 --> 00:11:02,658
We know what's out there.

158
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:05,727
Craster's been out here
surviving.

159
00:11:05,761 --> 00:11:08,363
So he's your new protector now?

160
00:11:08,397 --> 00:11:09,897
Our good friend Craster?

161
00:11:09,932 --> 00:11:11,632
We're like the sons
he never had.

162
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:14,235
Mormont isn't
gonna save you.

163
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:17,605
This lummox here
isn't gonna save you.

164
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,973
When the walkers come calling,

165
00:11:19,007 --> 00:11:21,675
Craster will serve us up
like so many pigs.

166
00:11:23,178 --> 00:11:25,044
If we want to live...

167
00:11:27,247 --> 00:11:29,681
we'll have to look out
for ourselves.

168
00:11:31,017 --> 00:11:32,984
Shh, shh, shh.

169
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,661
- You woke him.
- I'm sorry.

170
00:11:48,997 --> 00:11:51,131
- He's beautiful.
- Shh!

171
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,704
He's beautiful.

172
00:11:57,738 --> 00:11:59,772
Does he have a name?

173
00:11:59,806 --> 00:12:03,408
- No.
- Are you going to give him one?

174
00:12:03,442 --> 00:12:04,976
Why?

175
00:12:08,947 --> 00:12:11,114
Here.

176
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:13,550
- Gilly. - You said to hold it for you
until you came back.

177
00:12:13,584 --> 00:12:15,118
- You're back.
- I wanted you to have it.

178
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:17,119
I don't want
your stupid thimble.

179
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:20,422
I want to save
my baby's life.
Can you do that?

180
00:12:20,457 --> 00:12:22,491
Can you?

181
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,427
I don't have time for you.

182
00:12:26,462 --> 00:12:28,762
I don't have time
for anyone but him

183
00:12:28,797 --> 00:12:31,999
because he doesn't
have much time.

184
00:12:57,088 --> 00:12:59,422
You have to go after him.

185
00:12:59,456 --> 00:13:01,324
How?

186
00:13:01,358 --> 00:13:03,425
You know how.

187
00:13:26,548 --> 00:13:29,249
Brandon.

188
00:13:29,283 --> 00:13:32,685
- Mother.
- How many times have I told you?

189
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,121
- No climbing.
- Mother, I need to find it.

190
00:13:35,155 --> 00:13:36,889
- It's here. It's calling me.
- I want you to promise me.

191
00:13:36,923 --> 00:13:38,857
No more climbing.
Promise me.

192
00:13:38,891 --> 00:13:40,558
Promise me!
Promise me!

193
00:13:40,592 --> 00:13:42,894
- Mother! Mother!
- Promise me! Promise me, Bran!

194
00:13:42,928 --> 00:13:44,162
Promise me!

195
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:59,509
Is he very large?

196
00:13:59,544 --> 00:14:01,311
No larger than usual,
apparently.

197
00:14:01,345 --> 00:14:04,380
- And yet they said that he was--
- Extraordinary.

198
00:14:04,414 --> 00:14:07,016
The most extraordinary man
they've ever had.

199
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,483
And they've had a lot of men.

200
00:14:08,518 --> 00:14:10,518
We're talking about
the same Podrick?

201
00:14:10,553 --> 00:14:13,087
The quiet boy
in Lord Tyrion's service?

202
00:14:13,122 --> 00:14:14,689
Seems a bit simple?

203
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,725
What did he do to them?

204
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:19,025
I don't know, my lord.

205
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,428
The girls are usually
quite descriptive.

206
00:14:21,462 --> 00:14:23,396
So what did they say?

207
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,465
They said it was hard
to describe.

208
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,067
Huh.

209
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:32,838
Prodigies appear
in the oddest of places.

210
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:37,075
And what did Littlefinger say
about this loss of income?

211
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,177
He was too preoccupied
to notice.

212
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,512
He's leaving
for the Eyrie soon.

213
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:43,046
I'm helping him prepare
for his journey.

214
00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:45,681
Ah, yes, to pursue
his enduring love

215
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:49,218
of the Lady Arryn and the
title that comes with her.

216
00:14:49,252 --> 00:14:51,353
Sad, really.

217
00:14:51,387 --> 00:14:53,354
Is that all it takes

218
00:14:53,388 --> 00:14:56,490
to make our friend lose
interest in poor Sansa Stark?

219
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:00,060
He hasn't spoken to her
since the last time,

220
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,895
as far as I know.

221
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:04,564
But I don't think
he's lost interest.

222
00:15:04,598 --> 00:15:06,699
What makes you say so?

223
00:15:08,402 --> 00:15:11,103
- His shipboard inventory.
- Ah.

224
00:15:12,905 --> 00:15:14,406
You can read.

225
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,507
Rare for a woman
in your profession.

226
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:19,542
- Former profession.
- Of course.

227
00:15:19,577 --> 00:15:23,145
I'm missing something obvious
you're about to point out?

228
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,080
Two featherbeds.

229
00:15:25,115 --> 00:15:27,649
He's bringing two
featherbeds for the cabin.

230
00:15:29,452 --> 00:15:31,987
Who is important enough
to Littlefinger

231
00:15:32,021 --> 00:15:34,823
to merit a featherbed
besides Littlefinger?

232
00:15:34,857 --> 00:15:37,092
Could he be bringing
one of his girls?

233
00:15:37,126 --> 00:15:39,427
He's not interested
in them, my lord.

234
00:15:39,462 --> 00:15:41,196
How do you know?

235
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,631
Because I'm one of his girls.

236
00:15:43,665 --> 00:15:47,100
Prodigies in odd places indeed.

237
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:51,638
Rhaenyra Targaryen
was murdered by her brother,

238
00:15:51,672 --> 00:15:54,140
or rather his dragon.

239
00:15:54,174 --> 00:15:56,775
It ate her
while her son watched.

240
00:15:58,378 --> 00:16:01,647
What's left of her is buried in
the crypts right down there.

241
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:07,752
The ceremony is traditionally
held in the main sanctum,

242
00:16:07,787 --> 00:16:11,022
which seats 700 comfortably.

243
00:16:11,056 --> 00:16:13,724
There appears to be a
good deal of room elsewhere

244
00:16:13,758 --> 00:16:16,359
on the premises
for everyone else.

245
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:19,562
There aren't more than 700
people of any importance.

246
00:16:19,596 --> 00:16:22,731
No, the rest are there
to look adoringly

247
00:16:22,765 --> 00:16:24,799
upon the 700 to remind them

248
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:28,003
how superior they must be
to have the best seats.

249
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:29,537
Over there in that urn,

250
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,906
the ashes of Aerion Targaryen.

251
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,908
Aerion Brightflame
they called him.

252
00:16:33,942 --> 00:16:37,111
He thought drinking wildfire
would turn him into a dragon.

253
00:16:37,145 --> 00:16:40,347
He was wrong.

254
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:42,416
And, of course,
there's the Mad King,

255
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,184
killed by my uncle.

256
00:16:44,219 --> 00:16:47,420
Would you like to see where the
last Targaryens are buried?

257
00:16:47,454 --> 00:16:50,423
Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn't
find all this a bit macabre?

258
00:16:50,457 --> 00:16:52,191
Oh, no, it's quite
all right, Your Grace.

259
00:16:52,225 --> 00:16:54,793
I'd love to see
their tombs, really.

260
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:57,129
It's like taking a walk
through history.

261
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,401
- The tomb's just up here.
- This is so exciting.

262
00:17:03,435 --> 00:17:05,069
You were married
here, Your Grace?

263
00:17:05,103 --> 00:17:08,271
- Yes.
- Must seem like only yesterday.

264
00:17:08,305 --> 00:17:10,072
Seems like a lifetime ago.

265
00:17:10,107 --> 00:17:12,441
Your husband, was he
buried here as well?

266
00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:15,577
No, he wanted his remains
returned to Storm's End.

267
00:17:15,611 --> 00:17:19,180
- Such a tragedy.
- A fairly predictable tragedy.

268
00:17:19,214 --> 00:17:20,748
Hunting and drinking don't mix.

269
00:17:20,782 --> 00:17:22,350
I should say not.

270
00:17:22,384 --> 00:17:24,452
My son's a hunter.
It helps him forget

271
00:17:24,486 --> 00:17:27,354
he's never been within
a mile of a real battle.

272
00:17:27,389 --> 00:17:30,357
I seem to recall he laid
siege to Storm's End

273
00:17:30,391 --> 00:17:31,925
for the better part of a year.

274
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:33,693
All he laid siege to

275
00:17:33,728 --> 00:17:36,029
was the banquet table
in the command tent.

276
00:17:36,063 --> 00:17:39,298
I told him to stay out
of Robert's rebellion.

277
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,835
He had no business
fighting an actual warrior.

278
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,304
We mothers do what we can

279
00:17:46,338 --> 00:17:48,506
to keep our sons
from the grave.

280
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,541
But they do seem
to yearn for it.

281
00:17:50,575 --> 00:17:53,309
We shower them with good sense,

282
00:17:53,344 --> 00:17:56,846
and it slides right off
like rain off a wing.

283
00:17:57,948 --> 00:17:59,849
And yet the world
belongs to them.

284
00:17:59,883 --> 00:18:02,785
A ridiculous
arrangement, to my mind.

285
00:18:06,488 --> 00:18:08,689
The gods have seen fit
to make it so.

286
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:12,391
My father didn't
want them here.

287
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,059
He was going to have
their bodies burned

288
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,760
and thrown in the Blackwater,

289
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:19,296
but the High Septon
convinced him otherwise.

290
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,965
I'm glad he did.

291
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,367
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

292
00:18:24,402 --> 00:18:26,135
I know they did terrible
things at the end,

293
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:30,072
but their ancestors built this.

294
00:18:32,008 --> 00:18:33,908
Sometimes severity

295
00:18:33,942 --> 00:18:36,076
is the price we pay
for greatness.

296
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,414
I couldn't agree more.

297
00:18:50,024 --> 00:18:52,458
Shall we go and see them?

298
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:54,927
If you give them your love,

299
00:18:54,962 --> 00:18:58,397
they will return it
a thousandfold.

300
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,933
I've spoken with them.

301
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:03,301
I know how they feel about you.

302
00:19:03,335 --> 00:19:06,771
You led the defense
of King's Landing.

303
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,508
They adore you.

304
00:19:18,516 --> 00:19:21,051
Open the doors.

305
00:19:28,758 --> 00:19:30,392
Joffrey.

306
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:33,228
Wait.

307
00:19:34,497 --> 00:19:36,164
- Lady Margaery!
- Lady Margaery!

308
00:19:36,198 --> 00:19:38,966
Bless you, Lady Margaery!

309
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,435
- Lady Margaery!
- Lady Margaery!

310
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:44,505
- Margaery!
- Long live Lady Margaery!

311
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:47,040
King Joffrey!

312
00:19:49,143 --> 00:19:52,311
King Joffrey!
King Joffrey!

313
00:19:52,345 --> 00:19:54,446
King Joffrey!

314
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,748
Gods bless King Joffrey!

315
00:20:02,586 --> 00:20:04,487
How far is it
to Deepwood Motte?

316
00:20:04,521 --> 00:20:06,088
Not far, my lord.

317
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,090
Your sister is waiting
for you there.

318
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,925
- She sent you to save me?
- Yes.

319
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:13,795
I served them, the men
who were torturing you.

320
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:16,398
I did what they told me and
waited for the right moment.

321
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:18,800
Why would you risk
your life for me?

322
00:20:18,835 --> 00:20:21,836
I grew up on
Saltcliffe, my lord.

323
00:20:21,871 --> 00:20:25,005
I was only a boy
when they took you away.

324
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,007
My father brought me and my
brothers up to the bluffs

325
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:30,043
so we could watch the ship
that carried you off.

326
00:20:30,077 --> 00:20:33,112
I remember the look on my
father's face when he told us,

327
00:20:33,146 --> 00:20:35,948
"That's Balon Greyjoy's
last living son."

328
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,684
And those are the words
I heard over and over again

329
00:20:39,718 --> 00:20:42,019
when I saw what
they were doing to you.

330
00:20:42,053 --> 00:20:44,054
Those men,

331
00:20:44,088 --> 00:20:47,090
they said my father knew
what they were doing to me.

332
00:20:48,825 --> 00:20:50,993
Did he?

333
00:20:51,027 --> 00:20:53,963
I-- I don't know,
my lord.

334
00:20:53,997 --> 00:20:57,466
They-- they never
told me much.

335
00:21:06,508 --> 00:21:08,075
My sister's men
are loyal to her.

336
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,277
We don't need
to hide from them.

337
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:12,346
Not all those
are your sister's men.

338
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,081
Some of them are loyal
to your father.

339
00:21:18,418 --> 00:21:20,418
What is it?

340
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:22,053
I was just thinking
how jealous I was

341
00:21:22,087 --> 00:21:24,222
when my father told Yara
to take this place.

342
00:21:24,256 --> 00:21:26,023
What did he tell you to do?

343
00:21:26,058 --> 00:21:28,258
Raid fishing villages.

344
00:21:28,293 --> 00:21:30,127
He didn't trust me.

345
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:31,928
Thought I was a Stark.

346
00:21:31,963 --> 00:21:34,898
Ha. I could never
be a Stark.

347
00:21:34,932 --> 00:21:37,400
Robb Stark always
reminded me of that.

348
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:39,936
- He lorded it over you?
- Didn't have to.

349
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,138
All he had to do was be.

350
00:21:44,241 --> 00:21:47,176
Be who he was born to be.

351
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,678
His life fit him
better than his clothes.

352
00:21:49,713 --> 00:21:52,214
How could someone like that
ever be a brother to me?

353
00:21:52,249 --> 00:21:54,516
He's the King in the North.

354
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,850
And me...

355
00:21:55,885 --> 00:21:58,552
my father gave me a choice

356
00:21:58,587 --> 00:22:00,487
and I made it.

357
00:22:01,956 --> 00:22:03,824
I could never be a Stark.

358
00:22:03,858 --> 00:22:07,327
But ironborn,

359
00:22:07,362 --> 00:22:09,997
that's what I was born to be.

360
00:22:14,836 --> 00:22:17,437
I paid the iron price
for Winterfell.

361
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:26,045
I murdered those boys.

362
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:30,949
The Stark boys?

363
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,052
Never found them.

364
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:37,722
Just some poor orphans
living with a farmer.

365
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,926
I let Dagmer slit their throats

366
00:22:43,961 --> 00:22:46,129
and I let him
burn the bodies...

367
00:22:47,765 --> 00:22:50,566
so I could keep Winterfell...

368
00:22:52,736 --> 00:22:55,104
and make my father proud.

369
00:22:56,072 --> 00:22:58,607
Maybe it's not too late.

370
00:23:01,677 --> 00:23:03,778
It is.

371
00:23:11,285 --> 00:23:14,820
My real father lost his head
at King's Landing.

372
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,891
I made a choice...

373
00:23:21,127 --> 00:23:23,461
and I chose wrong.

374
00:23:25,964 --> 00:23:28,632
And now I've burned
everything down.

375
00:23:30,268 --> 00:23:32,669
Not everything, my lord.

376
00:23:35,505 --> 00:23:36,805
She's up here.

377
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,717
- Yara.
- Shh.

378
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:53,286
Wait.

379
00:24:01,961 --> 00:24:04,396
I brought him back.
He killed the others.

380
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,264
What?
No, I didn't.

381
00:24:06,298 --> 00:24:08,466
You can't!

382
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,202
No, please stop!

383
00:24:13,905 --> 00:24:16,539
No!

384
00:24:16,573 --> 00:24:18,340
Put him back where he belongs.

385
00:24:42,896 --> 00:24:44,296
Eat.

386
00:24:48,234 --> 00:24:49,834
What are you doing?

387
00:24:50,703 --> 00:24:52,470
I'm dying.

388
00:24:52,504 --> 00:24:55,472
You can't die.

389
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:57,808
You need to live

390
00:24:57,842 --> 00:25:00,310
to take revenge.

391
00:25:00,344 --> 00:25:02,811
I don't care about revenge.

392
00:25:02,846 --> 00:25:04,813
You coward.

393
00:25:06,148 --> 00:25:08,749
A little misfortune
and you're giving up.

394
00:25:10,318 --> 00:25:12,352
Misfor--

395
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:13,954
misfortune?

396
00:25:13,988 --> 00:25:15,755
You lost your hand.

397
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:18,524
My sword hand.
I was that hand.

398
00:25:20,594 --> 00:25:23,095
You have a taste--

399
00:25:23,129 --> 00:25:25,830
one taste of the real world

400
00:25:25,865 --> 00:25:28,967
where people have important
things taken from them

401
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:31,769
and you whine and cry and quit.

402
00:25:31,803 --> 00:25:34,271
You sound like a bloody woman.

403
00:25:59,961 --> 00:26:02,295
I know what you did for me.

404
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:06,566
You told them Tarth
was full of sapphires.

405
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,537
It's called the Sapphire Isle

406
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:14,740
because of the blue
of its water.

407
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,843
You knew that.

408
00:26:26,984 --> 00:26:29,318
Why did you help me?

409
00:26:55,373 --> 00:26:57,107
You wanted to speak to me?

410
00:26:57,141 --> 00:26:59,509
Yes, about Jaime.

411
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:02,178
What about him?

412
00:27:02,212 --> 00:27:03,612
I wanted to make sure

413
00:27:03,647 --> 00:27:06,081
we're doing everything
we can to get him back.

414
00:27:09,418 --> 00:27:12,286
When Catelyn Stark
took Tyrion prisoner...

415
00:27:13,889 --> 00:27:15,623
what did I do in response?

416
00:27:15,657 --> 00:27:18,692
- You started a war.
- And if I would start a war

417
00:27:18,726 --> 00:27:21,094
for that lecherous
little stump,

418
00:27:21,128 --> 00:27:24,297
what do you think I am doing
for my oldest son and heir?

419
00:27:24,331 --> 00:27:26,999
Whatever you can.

420
00:27:27,034 --> 00:27:29,802
Whatever I can.

421
00:27:41,647 --> 00:27:43,915
- You're still here.
- Yes.

422
00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:49,086
Why?

423
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,520
Did it ever occur to you

424
00:27:50,554 --> 00:27:52,555
that I might be the one
who deserves your confidence

425
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:55,057
and your trust, not your sons?

426
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:57,960
Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me.

427
00:27:57,994 --> 00:28:00,195
Years and years
of lectures on family

428
00:28:00,229 --> 00:28:02,297
and legacy--

429
00:28:02,331 --> 00:28:03,831
the same lecture, really,

430
00:28:03,866 --> 00:28:07,168
just with tiny,
tedious variations--

431
00:28:07,202 --> 00:28:08,936
did it ever occur to you
that your daughter

432
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:12,639
might be the only one listening to them?
Living by them?

433
00:28:12,673 --> 00:28:16,242
That she might have the most
to contribute to your legacy

434
00:28:16,276 --> 00:28:19,178
that you love so much more
than your actual children?

435
00:28:26,219 --> 00:28:29,320
All right.
Contribute.

436
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,091
The Tyrells are a problem.

437
00:28:35,427 --> 00:28:38,695
The Tyrells helped us
defeat Stannis Baratheon.

438
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:41,998
The Tyrells saved your life,
your children's lives.

439
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,734
Margaery has her claws
in Joffrey.

440
00:28:47,537 --> 00:28:49,737
She knows how
to manipulate him.

441
00:28:49,772 --> 00:28:51,139
Good.

442
00:28:51,173 --> 00:28:53,274
I wish you knew
how to manipulate him.

443
00:28:54,676 --> 00:28:57,244
I don't distrust you
because you're a woman.

444
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,781
I distrust you because you're not
as smart as you think you are.

445
00:29:00,815 --> 00:29:03,584
You've allowed that boy
to ride roughshod over you

446
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:06,587
and everyone else in this city.

447
00:29:11,593 --> 00:29:13,961
Perhaps...

448
00:29:13,995 --> 00:29:17,464
you should try stopping him
from doing what he likes.

449
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:23,937
I will.

450
00:29:25,272 --> 00:29:27,173
Do you like it, Nana?

451
00:29:27,207 --> 00:29:30,075
Another golden rose.
How original.

452
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,511
I eat from plates
stamped with roses.

453
00:29:32,545 --> 00:29:34,746
I sleep in sheets
embroidered with roses.

454
00:29:34,781 --> 00:29:37,649
I have a golden rose
painted on my chamber pot,

455
00:29:37,683 --> 00:29:40,084
as if that makes it
smell any better.

456
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,786
Roses are boring, dear.

457
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,355
"Growing strong."

458
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:47,490
Ha! The dullest words
of any house.

459
00:29:47,525 --> 00:29:49,425
"Winter is coming!"

460
00:29:49,459 --> 00:29:51,494
Now that's memorable.

461
00:29:51,528 --> 00:29:54,596
"We do not sow."
Strong. Strong.

462
00:29:54,631 --> 00:29:56,665
Those are houses
you watch out for.

463
00:29:56,699 --> 00:30:00,835
Direwolves and krakens,
fierce beasts.

464
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:02,870
But a golden rose
growing strong--

465
00:30:02,904 --> 00:30:06,273
ha, that strikes fear
in the heart.

466
00:30:07,508 --> 00:30:10,743
Look, little loves.

467
00:30:10,778 --> 00:30:12,678
A spider in the garden.

468
00:30:13,814 --> 00:30:15,514
Run along now.

469
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:17,483
Grow strong.

470
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:21,052
My lady.

471
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:24,422
I wanted to personally
welcome you to King's Landing.

472
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:26,924
The city has been made
brighter by your presence.

473
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:30,027
The city is made brighter
by my presence?

474
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:32,429
Is that your usual line,
Lord Varys?

475
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:34,030
Are you here to seduce me?

476
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,732
A little obvious, perhaps.

477
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,667
Oh, no, please.

478
00:30:37,701 --> 00:30:41,070
Seduce away.
It's been so long.

479
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:43,472
Though I rather think
it's all for naught.

480
00:30:43,506 --> 00:30:47,142
What happens when the nonexistent
bumps against the decrepit?

481
00:30:48,344 --> 00:30:50,445
A question for
the philosophers.

482
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:53,514
But you've come mincing
all this way for something.

483
00:30:53,548 --> 00:30:55,682
- So?
- Might I sit?

484
00:30:55,716 --> 00:30:57,617
No.

485
00:30:57,651 --> 00:31:00,819
Come, I've heard
you're such a clever man.

486
00:31:00,854 --> 00:31:03,555
I'm curious why
you've sought me out.

487
00:31:04,757 --> 00:31:07,325
You've taken an interest
in Sansa Stark.

488
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:08,492
Have I?

489
00:31:08,527 --> 00:31:10,394
Because I spoke to her
once in this garden

490
00:31:10,428 --> 00:31:13,330
and one of your little spies
came running to tell you?

491
00:31:13,365 --> 00:31:14,665
Why shouldn't I take
an interest?

492
00:31:14,699 --> 00:31:16,466
- She's an interesting girl.
- Is she?

493
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:18,301
No, not particularly.

494
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,370
But she's had
an interesting childhood.

495
00:31:20,404 --> 00:31:23,172
She has, sadly.

496
00:31:23,206 --> 00:31:25,507
Well, forgive me for wasting
your time, then.

497
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:28,876
I thought we shared certain
hopes for her well-being.

498
00:31:28,911 --> 00:31:30,377
Come, come.

499
00:31:30,411 --> 00:31:32,979
You surrender rather easily.

500
00:31:34,482 --> 00:31:35,849
Walk with me.

501
00:31:35,883 --> 00:31:37,617
I know the walls have ears,

502
00:31:37,651 --> 00:31:39,986
but apparently
the shrubbery does, too.

503
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,822
I choose my allies carefully

504
00:31:42,856 --> 00:31:45,824
and my enemies
more carefully still.

505
00:31:45,858 --> 00:31:47,759
Which is Sansa Stark?

506
00:31:47,793 --> 00:31:50,595
Neither.
A babe in the woods.

507
00:31:50,629 --> 00:31:52,830
- I admired her father.
- Yes.

508
00:31:52,865 --> 00:31:54,965
Ned Stark had many admirers,

509
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,433
and how many stepped forward

510
00:31:56,467 --> 00:31:59,035
when the executioner
came for his head?

511
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,636
I could not help Lord Stark.

512
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:03,906
- Perhaps I can help his daughter.
- How?

513
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,409
You're not the only one who
has taken an interest in her.

514
00:32:07,443 --> 00:32:09,210
That's hardly surprising.

515
00:32:09,245 --> 00:32:11,579
She's a beautiful girl
with a famous name.

516
00:32:11,613 --> 00:32:15,149
Indeed. She'd make a lovely
match for the right suitor.

517
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:18,051
It almost feels as if you're
about to arrive at the point.

518
00:32:18,086 --> 00:32:20,720
Littlefinger is not long
for the capital.

519
00:32:20,754 --> 00:32:22,755
A confidant of mine has told me

520
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:25,690
that when he goes,
Sansa Stark goes with him.

521
00:32:25,725 --> 00:32:28,026
And why have you come
to me with this matter?

522
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:31,863
Littlefinger was born with no
lands, no wealth, no armies.

523
00:32:31,897 --> 00:32:33,631
He has acquired the first two.

524
00:32:33,665 --> 00:32:35,399
How long before
he has the army?

525
00:32:35,434 --> 00:32:37,534
Perhaps you'll laugh,

526
00:32:37,569 --> 00:32:39,602
but I know him better than most

527
00:32:39,637 --> 00:32:41,838
and this is the truth.

528
00:32:41,872 --> 00:32:46,476
Littlefinger is one of the most
dangerous men in Westeros.

529
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,878
If Robb Stark falls,

530
00:32:48,912 --> 00:32:51,313
Sansa Stark is the key
to the North.

531
00:32:51,347 --> 00:32:54,315
And if Littlefinger marries her,
he'll have the key in his pocket.

532
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:56,117
Which seems such a shame.

533
00:32:56,151 --> 00:32:58,252
Why should a man
with such a low reputation

534
00:32:58,286 --> 00:33:00,254
steal away such a lovely bride?

535
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:02,355
You must despise him.

536
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,523
You're working so hard
to undermine him.

537
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:07,492
Actually, I rather enjoy him.

538
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,627
But he would see
this country burn

539
00:33:09,662 --> 00:33:12,062
if he could be
king of the ashes.

540
00:33:12,097 --> 00:33:14,131
You are a clever man,
Lord Varys.

541
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:15,699
You are too kind.

542
00:33:15,733 --> 00:33:18,668
I believe I have
a possible solution.

543
00:33:18,702 --> 00:33:20,470
One doesn't need
to be clever for that.

544
00:33:20,504 --> 00:33:22,071
It's all rather obvious,
isn't it?

545
00:33:33,515 --> 00:33:35,248
Ahem.

546
00:33:35,283 --> 00:33:37,316
I didn't mean to disturb you.

547
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:39,084
You haven't.

548
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,886
We'd like some privacy, please.

549
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,121
If you wouldn't mind
waiting back inside the keep.

550
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,558
Or if you'd be kind enough
to give me your names,

551
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:50,494
I'll ask the king
to speak with you himself.

552
00:33:54,498 --> 00:33:56,199
What did you pray for?

553
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:58,868
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?

554
00:33:58,902 --> 00:34:01,603
I'll tell you what I prayed
for in the sept this morning.

555
00:34:01,638 --> 00:34:05,440
Let's see, for my family's
health and happiness,

556
00:34:05,474 --> 00:34:08,709
for an end to the war,
for a short winter.

557
00:34:08,744 --> 00:34:11,378
Boring and traditional,
I'm afraid.

558
00:34:11,412 --> 00:34:15,214
- And you?
- I'm sorry, I just can't.

559
00:34:15,248 --> 00:34:16,816
My cousin Alanna

560
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:19,385
was the most beautiful
girl I'd ever seen.

561
00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:21,553
When I was 12, I was
all elbows and knees

562
00:34:21,588 --> 00:34:24,055
and Alanna looked like a
goddess sent to torture me.

563
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,890
Pig-face, she called me.

564
00:34:25,925 --> 00:34:27,792
Pig-face?
That's ridiculous.

565
00:34:27,826 --> 00:34:30,061
I think it had something
to do with my nose.

566
00:34:30,095 --> 00:34:32,496
Whenever she passed me
in the halls, she'd oink.

567
00:34:35,567 --> 00:34:38,368
So I prayed that she'd catch
a horrible skin disease.

568
00:34:38,403 --> 00:34:40,837
A week after that, she came
down with porridge plague.

569
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:43,472
- Porridge plague?
- You don't have it in the North?

570
00:34:43,507 --> 00:34:45,908
Your skin starts
to look like boiled oats

571
00:34:45,942 --> 00:34:48,743
and eventually your face slides
off and you die in agony.

572
00:34:48,777 --> 00:34:50,678
But that's awful.

573
00:34:52,881 --> 00:34:55,416
You're--

574
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:57,418
I believed you!

575
00:34:57,452 --> 00:34:59,353
Porridge plague.
I'm an idiot.

576
00:34:59,387 --> 00:35:01,588
Don't say that.
No, you're not.

577
00:35:01,623 --> 00:35:04,223
So what happened to Alanna?

578
00:35:04,257 --> 00:35:06,358
Oh, she grew up to be
the most beautiful woman

579
00:35:06,392 --> 00:35:09,327
and married a handsome lord
and they have darling children

580
00:35:09,362 --> 00:35:11,162
and live in a castle
by the sea.

581
00:35:11,196 --> 00:35:13,798
It's all terribly frustrating.

582
00:35:13,832 --> 00:35:16,534
I'm sure she's jealous
of you now.

583
00:35:16,568 --> 00:35:18,835
You'll be married
here in the capital

584
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:22,538
and she'll have to come watch and
pretend to be happy that you're queen.

585
00:35:25,342 --> 00:35:29,111
I want us to be friends,
good friends.

586
00:35:29,146 --> 00:35:31,346
That would make me very happy.

587
00:35:32,981 --> 00:35:34,815
You must see Highgarden.

588
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,884
You'd love it there.
I know you would.

589
00:35:36,918 --> 00:35:39,819
We have a great masquerade the
night of the harvest moon.

590
00:35:39,854 --> 00:35:41,287
You should see the costumes.

591
00:35:41,322 --> 00:35:43,023
People work on them for months.

592
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:46,492
I-- I don't think
the queen

593
00:35:46,526 --> 00:35:48,027
would let me leave
King's Landing.

594
00:35:48,061 --> 00:35:49,861
The Queen Regent, you mean.

595
00:35:49,896 --> 00:35:52,263
Once I marry Joffrey,
I'll be queen.

596
00:35:54,066 --> 00:35:58,369
And if you were
to marry Loras...

597
00:36:00,772 --> 00:36:04,574
Oh, your place would be at
Highgarden, wouldn't it?

598
00:36:05,609 --> 00:36:07,977
We would be sisters, you and I.

599
00:36:08,012 --> 00:36:09,945
Would you like that?

600
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:26,426
His name was Bannen.

601
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,161
He was a good man,

602
00:36:28,195 --> 00:36:30,130
a good ranger.

603
00:36:30,164 --> 00:36:32,298
He came to us from--

604
00:36:33,867 --> 00:36:35,935
where did he come from?

605
00:36:35,969 --> 00:36:38,704
Down White Harbor way.

606
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,872
He came to us
from White Harbor.

607
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,941
Never failed in his duty.

608
00:36:43,975 --> 00:36:47,077
He kept his vows
the best he could.

609
00:36:47,111 --> 00:36:51,014
He rode far, fought fiercely.

610
00:36:53,117 --> 00:36:55,551
We shall never see
his like again.

611
00:36:55,586 --> 00:36:59,021
And now his
watch has ended.

612
00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:02,824
And now his watch has ended.

613
00:37:07,162 --> 00:37:10,430
Didn't think a broke foot
could kill a man.

614
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:13,332
It wasn't his foot
that killed him.

615
00:37:13,367 --> 00:37:16,035
That bastard Craster
starved him to death.

616
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:17,870
Craster's got
his daughters to feed.

617
00:37:17,904 --> 00:37:19,304
You on his side?

618
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:22,407
We can't just show up
and steal all his food.

619
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:25,076
We're brothers of the
Night's Watch, not thieves.

620
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,911
The day we leave,

621
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:30,547
Craster will tap
a barrel of our wine

622
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:33,718
and sit down to a feast
of ham and potatoes

623
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,720
and laugh at us

624
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,989
starving in the snow.

625
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,693
He's a bloody wildling
is all he is.

626
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,731
Never knew Bannen
could smell so good.

627
00:37:59,308 --> 00:38:02,877
You have one son,
don't you, Mormont?

628
00:38:04,446 --> 00:38:06,646
I had my 99th.

629
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:10,817
You ever meet a man
with 99 sons?

630
00:38:12,586 --> 00:38:16,088
And more daughters
than I can count.

631
00:38:16,123 --> 00:38:18,523
- I'm glad for you.
- Are you now?

632
00:38:18,558 --> 00:38:22,227
Me, I'll be glad when you
and yours have gone.

633
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:24,329
As soon as our wounded
are strong enough.

634
00:38:24,363 --> 00:38:26,297
Ah.

635
00:38:26,331 --> 00:38:28,432
They're as strong
as they're gonna get.

636
00:38:30,334 --> 00:38:31,735
Them that's dying,

637
00:38:31,769 --> 00:38:33,870
why don't you cut their
throats and be done with it?

638
00:38:33,904 --> 00:38:35,872
Hmm?

639
00:38:35,906 --> 00:38:39,107
Or leave them
if you've not the stomach

640
00:38:39,142 --> 00:38:40,675
and I'll sort them myself.

641
00:38:42,011 --> 00:38:44,879
Whose throat you
gonna cut, old man?

642
00:38:48,316 --> 00:38:49,650
Wait outside.

643
00:38:49,684 --> 00:38:53,086
It's cold outside and
there's nothing to eat.

644
00:38:53,121 --> 00:38:54,621
My wives gave you bread.

645
00:38:54,655 --> 00:38:57,891
There's sawdust in the bread.

646
00:38:57,925 --> 00:38:59,459
You don't like it,

647
00:38:59,493 --> 00:39:01,861
you go out there
and eat the snow.

648
00:39:06,766 --> 00:39:10,601
I'd rather eat what
you've got hidden away.

649
00:39:12,704 --> 00:39:15,671
I told you to wait outside.

650
00:39:15,706 --> 00:39:17,539
He's sitting there
drinking our wine,

651
00:39:17,574 --> 00:39:19,274
eating his fill while we die.

652
00:39:20,443 --> 00:39:22,944
I gave you crows enough.

653
00:39:22,978 --> 00:39:24,245
I've got to feed my women!

654
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,179
So you admit you've got
a hidden larder, then?

655
00:39:26,214 --> 00:39:27,694
How else'd you make it
through winter?

656
00:39:27,715 --> 00:39:30,718
Enough!
Out!

657
00:39:30,752 --> 00:39:32,620
I am a godly man.

658
00:39:32,654 --> 00:39:34,154
You're a stingy bastard!

659
00:39:34,188 --> 00:39:35,555
Bastard?

660
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:39,092
Out with you, you little thief.

661
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:42,495
And you!
And you!

662
00:39:44,231 --> 00:39:46,765
Go sleep in the cold
on empty bellies.

663
00:39:49,135 --> 00:39:50,902
I'll chop the hands
off the next man

664
00:39:50,937 --> 00:39:53,271
who calls me bastard.

665
00:40:08,351 --> 00:40:09,985
You are a bastard.

666
00:40:12,654 --> 00:40:16,156
A daughter-fucking,
wildling bastard.

667
00:40:24,031 --> 00:40:25,965
The gods will
curse us for this.

668
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,334
- By all the laws--
- There are no laws beyond the Wall.

669
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:30,902
Now show us where
he hides the food

670
00:40:30,937 --> 00:40:33,037
or you'll get
the same as he did.

671
00:40:33,072 --> 00:40:35,473
Unhand her.

672
00:40:35,507 --> 00:40:37,374
I shall have your head for this.

673
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,188
- Quickly. Quickly.
- What's happening?

674
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:34,790
- I'm not going out there.
- No, we have to go. Now!

675
00:41:40,062 --> 00:41:42,496
Follow me.
I know the best way.

676
00:41:44,332 --> 00:41:46,233
Come on.

677
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,806
Run fast, Piggy,

678
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,141
and sleep well!

679
00:41:56,176 --> 00:41:59,111
I'll be cutting your throat
one of these nights.

680
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:05,949
Can I take
this hood off yet?

681
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:07,717
I do apologize, little lady,

682
00:42:07,752 --> 00:42:10,453
but it's better for you if you
don't see where we're going.

683
00:42:12,556 --> 00:42:14,623
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

684
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,959
Halt!

685
00:42:23,397 --> 00:42:25,865
- What is it?
- Blackstrap rum.

686
00:42:26,734 --> 00:42:28,401
Ugh!

687
00:42:28,435 --> 00:42:30,703
Not easy finding
molasses in wartime.

688
00:42:30,737 --> 00:42:32,604
I'd have some.

689
00:42:36,175 --> 00:42:37,608
Let's go home.

690
00:42:54,623 --> 00:42:56,390
What is this place?

691
00:42:56,424 --> 00:42:59,526
Somewhere neither wolves
nor lions come prowling.

692
00:43:08,501 --> 00:43:11,303
You look like
a bunch of swineherds.

693
00:43:11,337 --> 00:43:13,372
Some of us
were swineherds.

694
00:43:13,406 --> 00:43:16,074
And some of us tanners
and masons.

695
00:43:16,108 --> 00:43:17,475
That was before.

696
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,444
You're still swineherds

697
00:43:19,478 --> 00:43:22,380
and tanners and masons.

698
00:43:22,415 --> 00:43:25,416
You think carrying a crooked
spear makes you a soldier?

699
00:43:25,451 --> 00:43:28,652
No.

700
00:43:28,686 --> 00:43:31,988
Fighting in a war
makes you a soldier.

701
00:43:32,022 --> 00:43:34,056
Beric Dondarrion?

702
00:43:34,091 --> 00:43:35,791
You've seen better days.

703
00:43:35,825 --> 00:43:38,360
And I won't see them again.

704
00:43:39,762 --> 00:43:41,763
Stark deserters.

705
00:43:41,797 --> 00:43:44,398
Baratheon deserters.

706
00:43:44,433 --> 00:43:46,000
You lot aren't
fighting in a war.

707
00:43:46,034 --> 00:43:47,534
You're running from it.

708
00:43:47,569 --> 00:43:49,870
Last I heard, you were
King Joffrey's guard dog.

709
00:43:49,904 --> 00:43:53,773
But here you are
1,000 miles from home.

710
00:43:53,807 --> 00:43:55,508
Which of us is running?

711
00:43:55,543 --> 00:43:57,610
Untie these ropes
and we'll find out.

712
00:43:57,645 --> 00:44:01,347
What are you doing
leading a mob of peasants?

713
00:44:01,381 --> 00:44:04,182
Ned Stark ordered me
to execute your brother

714
00:44:04,216 --> 00:44:05,516
in King Robert's name.

715
00:44:05,551 --> 00:44:08,019
Ned Stark is dead.

716
00:44:08,053 --> 00:44:10,287
King Robert is dead.

717
00:44:10,322 --> 00:44:12,523
My brother's alive.

718
00:44:14,859 --> 00:44:16,726
You're fighting for ghosts.

719
00:44:16,761 --> 00:44:18,628
That's what we are--

720
00:44:18,662 --> 00:44:22,499
ghosts waiting for you
in the dark.

721
00:44:22,533 --> 00:44:24,900
You can't see us,

722
00:44:24,935 --> 00:44:26,869
but we see you.

723
00:44:26,903 --> 00:44:29,171
No matter whose cloak
you wear--

724
00:44:29,205 --> 00:44:31,840
Lannister, Stark,
Baratheon--

725
00:44:31,874 --> 00:44:33,875
you prey on the weak,

726
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:36,745
the Brotherhood without
Banners will hunt you down.

727
00:44:36,779 --> 00:44:38,813
You found god?
Is that it?

728
00:44:38,848 --> 00:44:41,482
Aye.
I've been reborn

729
00:44:41,516 --> 00:44:43,483
in the light
of the one true god.

730
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,019
As have we all.

731
00:44:46,053 --> 00:44:48,554
As would any man who's seen
the things we've seen.

732
00:44:48,588 --> 00:44:51,290
If you mean to murder me, then
bloody well get on with it.

733
00:44:51,325 --> 00:44:54,493
You'll die soon enough, dog.

734
00:44:54,527 --> 00:44:58,063
But it won't be murder,
only justice.

735
00:44:58,097 --> 00:45:00,031
And a kinder
fate than you deserve.

736
00:45:00,065 --> 00:45:01,565
Lions you call yourselves.

737
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,801
At the Mummer's Ford, girls
of seven years were raped

738
00:45:04,836 --> 00:45:07,069
and babes still on the breast

739
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:08,771
were cut in two while
their mothers watched.

740
00:45:08,805 --> 00:45:11,073
I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford.

741
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:13,608
Dump your dead children
at some other door.

742
00:45:13,642 --> 00:45:16,010
House Clegane was built
upon dead children.

743
00:45:16,044 --> 00:45:18,579
I saw them lay Prince Aegon
and Princess Rhaenys

744
00:45:18,613 --> 00:45:20,147
before the Iron Throne.

745
00:45:20,181 --> 00:45:21,914
Do you take me for my brother?

746
00:45:21,949 --> 00:45:24,417
Is being born Clegane a crime?

747
00:45:24,451 --> 00:45:27,486
- Murder is a crime.
- I never touched the Targaryen babes.

748
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,322
I never saw them,
never smelled them,

749
00:45:30,357 --> 00:45:32,224
never heard them bawling.

750
00:45:32,259 --> 00:45:35,928
You want to cut my throat,
get on with it!

751
00:45:35,962 --> 00:45:37,996
But don't call me murderer

752
00:45:38,031 --> 00:45:39,865
and pretend that you're not.

753
00:45:39,899 --> 00:45:41,934
You murdered Mycah.

754
00:45:41,968 --> 00:45:43,468
The butcher's boy.

755
00:45:43,503 --> 00:45:45,437
My friend.

756
00:45:45,471 --> 00:45:48,706
He was 12 years old.
He was unarmed.

757
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,107
And you rode him down.

758
00:45:50,141 --> 00:45:52,843
You slung him over your horse
like he was some deer.

759
00:45:52,877 --> 00:45:55,445
Aye, he was a bleeder.

760
00:45:56,614 --> 00:45:58,180
You don't deny
killing this boy?

761
00:45:58,215 --> 00:45:59,848
I was Joffrey's sworn shield.

762
00:45:59,883 --> 00:46:01,884
- The boy attacked the prince.
- That's a lie!

763
00:46:01,918 --> 00:46:05,321
I hit Joffrey.
Mycah just ran away.

764
00:46:05,355 --> 00:46:06,989
Then I should have killed you.

765
00:46:07,023 --> 00:46:10,224
Not my place
to question princes.

766
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,728
You stand accused of murder.

767
00:46:13,762 --> 00:46:16,097
But no one here knows
the truth of the charge,

768
00:46:16,131 --> 00:46:18,466
so it is not for us
to judge you.

769
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,302
Only the Lord of Light
may do that now.

770
00:46:23,304 --> 00:46:25,972
I sentence you
to trial by combat.

771
00:46:28,042 --> 00:46:30,443
So, who will it be?

772
00:46:31,645 --> 00:46:33,379
Should we find out
if your fire god

773
00:46:33,413 --> 00:46:35,714
really loves you, priest?

774
00:46:35,748 --> 00:46:39,317
Or you, archer? What are you
worth with a sword in your hand?

775
00:46:40,753 --> 00:46:43,320
Or is the little girl
the bravest one here?

776
00:46:45,457 --> 00:46:47,424
Aye.

777
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:49,526
She might be.

778
00:46:51,629 --> 00:46:53,697
But it's me you'll fight.

779
00:47:17,419 --> 00:47:19,921
The master says
they are untested.

780
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:26,126
He says you would be wise
to blood them early.

781
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,761
There are many small cities
between here and there,

782
00:47:28,796 --> 00:47:30,897
cities ripe for sacking.

783
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:34,867
Should you take captives,

784
00:47:34,901 --> 00:47:38,069
the masters will buy the healthy
ones and for a good price.

785
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,141
And who knows?

786
00:47:44,176 --> 00:47:48,278
In 10 years, some of
the boys you send them

787
00:47:48,312 --> 00:47:50,513
may be Unsullied in their turn.

788
00:47:50,548 --> 00:47:52,682
Thus all shall prosper.

789
00:48:46,227 --> 00:48:49,429
Is it done, then?
They belong to me?

790
00:48:52,452 --> 00:48:53,999
It is done.

791
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:55,949
_

792
00:48:56,069 --> 00:48:57,770
You hold the whip.

793
00:48:58,003 --> 00:49:02,008
_

794
00:49:23,828 --> 00:49:25,395
_

795
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,263
_

796
00:49:35,553 --> 00:49:37,508
_

797
00:49:42,826 --> 00:49:46,721
_

798
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:50,645
_

799
00:49:52,442 --> 00:49:54,864
_

800
00:49:54,984 --> 00:49:58,211
_

801
00:49:58,331 --> 00:50:00,069
_

802
00:50:00,845 --> 00:50:03,438
_

803
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:09,858
_

804
00:50:09,978 --> 00:50:11,274
