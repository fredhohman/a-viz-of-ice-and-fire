1
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,938
What was she like?

2
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,275
She...

3
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,580
She had red hair.

4
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,250
Oh?

5
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,702
- How big were her feet?
- What do you want me to say?

6
00:02:41,753 --> 00:02:45,089
I want you to tell me
what it was like to have someone.

7
00:02:45,523 --> 00:02:47,091
To be with someone.

8
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,485
To love someone and have them 
love you back.

9
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:56,350
We're all gonna die 
a lot sooner than I'd planned.

10
00:02:56,785 --> 00:03:00,021
You're the closest
I'll ever get to knowing.

11
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,142
So you and Gilly never?

12
00:03:05,194 --> 00:03:06,477
No.

13
00:03:06,528 --> 00:03:08,813
She just had a baby.

14
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:12,984
And she never offered.

15
00:03:13,035 --> 00:03:15,486
But if she had,

16
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:18,155
you would have?

17
00:03:18,207 --> 00:03:20,992
You'd have broken your vows?

18
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,998
The interesting thing is,

19
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,084
our vows never
specifically forbid

20
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:32,136
intimate relations with women.

21
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,804
What?

22
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:37,258
"I shall take no wife," yes, that's in there.
There's no denying that.

23
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:39,727
"I shall father no children."
It's very specific.

24
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,513
But what do our vows
have to say about other

25
00:03:42,564 --> 00:03:45,733
activities is open
to interpretation.

26
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:51,188
I don't think Ser Alliser
cares much for interpretation.

27
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,696
Anyway, there's nothing
for him to interpret.

28
00:03:58,698 --> 00:04:00,698
We didn't.

29
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,087
So what's it like?

30
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:09,674
It's...

31
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,712
there's this person,
this whole other person.

32
00:04:14,714 --> 00:04:18,132
And you're wrapped up in them
and they're wrapped up in you.

33
00:04:18,183 --> 00:04:20,351
And you...

34
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,386
for a little...

35
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:24,722
for a little while,
you're more than just you.

36
00:04:24,724 --> 00:04:28,025
You're... I don't know.
I'm not a bleeding poet.

37
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,944
No, you're really not.

38
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,862
What did I get for it?

39
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,815
An arrow six inches
from my heart.

40
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,903
There'll be arrows for all
of us soon, I imagine.

41
00:04:38,954 --> 00:04:40,571
There will.

42
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:43,933
They've already done the worst
thing to me they could ever do.

43
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,746
Go get some sleep, Sam.

44
00:04:48,797 --> 00:04:51,048
I'll take this watch.

45
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,677
Did I ever tell you about her?

46
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:39,797
- My Sheila?
- Yes.

47
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:42,133
That was a night to remember.

48
00:05:42,184 --> 00:05:45,636
Of course, 
I'd had a good bit to drink.

49
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,856
Her fangs were sharp,

50
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,108
but she knew how to use them.

51
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:54,895
And she was nice
and soft down below.

52
00:05:54,946 --> 00:05:57,531
No, she was no ordinary beast.

53
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,450
Many is the man who...

54
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,569
I know you never fucked a bear.

55
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,372
You know you never
fucked a bear.

56
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,658
Right now I don't want to think
about the bear you never fucked.

57
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:10,828
Right now all I want
to think about

58
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,631
is each one of these arrows finding
its way into a crow's heart.

59
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,218
We could be waiting
here a while.

60
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,586
Good.

61
00:06:18,637 --> 00:06:20,918
The longer we wait,
the more arrows I'll have.

62
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,229
But they came up here to our land

63
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,815
and put up a big wall
and said it was theirs.

64
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,234
Then they started
hunting us down.

65
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,572
This time, we're the ones
doing the hunting.

66
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:43,077
You've got a lot
to say about killing.

67
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,196
Even more words than arrows.

68
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:49,600
Back in those villages, I killed
just as many of them as you did.

69
00:06:49,751 --> 00:06:51,752
More, I reckon.

70
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:55,873
Yes, but none of those
were your crow lover.

71
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,675
I probably killed him already.

72
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,126
So you've said.

73
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:01,345
And if not,

74
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,049
the only thing left of him is gonna be
his fun bits hanging around my neck.

75
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:06,892
More words.

76
00:07:06,935 --> 00:07:09,270
Know what I think
you do when you see him?

77
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:13,140
Serve him up a nice 
juicy slice of ginger minge.

78
00:07:16,744 --> 00:07:19,530
What, you've been thinking
about that ginger minge?

79
00:07:20,555 --> 00:07:22,555
Wondering what I taste like?

80
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:28,421
Maybe I have.

81
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:30,957
Jon Snow is mine.

82
00:07:32,793 --> 00:07:34,913
Anyone else tries to kill him,

83
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:37,680
I'll have an arrow for them.

84
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:44,136
And not one of your bald friends
is fast enough to stop me.

85
00:08:05,242 --> 00:08:10,129
And what is it that couldn't wait 
until morning, Tarly?

86
00:08:10,163 --> 00:08:12,298
Maester Aemon.

87
00:08:12,332 --> 00:08:14,834
- How did you know...
- That it was you?

88
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:17,470
Who else but Samwell Tarly

89
00:08:17,504 --> 00:08:19,088
would be wasting candles

90
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,858
to read in the middle
of the night?

91
00:08:25,646 --> 00:08:28,180
- Let me help you.
- Oh, no need.

92
00:08:29,483 --> 00:08:31,267
I know my way
around this library

93
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,186
better than any other
place in Castle Black.

94
00:08:34,188 --> 00:08:36,522
Thousands of books

95
00:08:36,524 --> 00:08:38,858
and no eyes to read them.

96
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,912
Old age is a wonderful
source of ironies...

97
00:08:42,946 --> 00:08:45,114
...if nothing else.

98
00:08:45,165 --> 00:08:47,667
But you didn't
answer my question.

99
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:49,285
What are you reading?

100
00:08:49,336 --> 00:08:51,704
Maester Faull.

101
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:54,707
Ah, the wildlings.

102
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:58,294
I can assure you that
the closest Maester Faull

103
00:08:58,345 --> 00:09:01,714
ever got to a wildling
was this very library.

104
00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:04,684
But what he says
about what they do,

105
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:06,185
it's all true.

106
00:09:06,219 --> 00:09:09,889
It's exactly what the survivors
of their raids report.

107
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,777
Yes, imagine the stories
wildlings tell about us.

108
00:09:16,313 --> 00:09:19,231
Love is the death of duty.

109
00:09:20,484 --> 00:09:22,985
I told that to your friend
Jon Snow once.

110
00:09:23,036 --> 00:09:27,239
He didn't listen
and neither did you.

111
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:31,243
Which is why you've abandoned
your watch atop the Wall...

112
00:09:31,294 --> 00:09:34,947
to come here and read
about the terrible things

113
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:39,418
that may have happened
to the girl you love.

114
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,121
I don't... love her.

115
00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:44,123
- Yes, you do.
- No.

116
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,142
Yes, you do.

117
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:50,346
Heard it in your voice 
when you first brought her to me.

118
00:09:50,397 --> 00:09:52,598
I remember how it sounds.

119
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:54,600
I was in love once.

120
00:09:54,651 --> 00:09:55,935
You were?

121
00:09:56,337 --> 00:10:00,072
You can imagine
all manner of horrors

122
00:10:00,074 --> 00:10:02,942
befalling that poor
girl and her child.

123
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:07,663
Is it so difficult to imagine
that an old person was once,

124
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:09,865
more or less, like you?

125
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,535
I'm sorry, Maester.

126
00:10:12,586 --> 00:10:14,286
I didn't mean it like that.

127
00:10:14,337 --> 00:10:18,224
Do you know who I was
before I came here?

128
00:10:18,258 --> 00:10:22,294
What I could have been here
if I'd only said the word?

129
00:10:23,797 --> 00:10:25,631
Of course you do.

130
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:29,385
I met many girls
when I was Aemon Targaryen.

131
00:10:29,436 --> 00:10:33,305
A future king always does.

132
00:10:34,307 --> 00:10:36,942
Some of them were quite forward

133
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:39,645
in their attempts
to win my affections.

134
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:43,115
One of them succeeded.

135
00:10:44,117 --> 00:10:46,035
I was very young.

136
00:10:46,669 --> 00:10:48,687
Who was she?

137
00:10:48,722 --> 00:10:50,656
Ah.

138
00:10:50,658 --> 00:10:53,242
I could tell you
everything about her.

139
00:10:53,293 --> 00:10:55,161
Who she was,

140
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:56,962
how we met,

141
00:10:56,997 --> 00:10:59,131
the color of her eyes,

142
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,901
and the shape of her nose.

143
00:11:03,804 --> 00:11:05,971
I can see her...

144
00:11:06,006 --> 00:11:08,841
right in front of me.

145
00:11:10,694 --> 00:11:14,263
She's more real than you are.

146
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,587
We could spend all night
trading tales of lost loves.

147
00:11:21,738 --> 00:11:24,523
Nothing makes the past
a sweeter place to visit

148
00:11:24,574 --> 00:11:27,726
than the prospect
of imminent death.

149
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:30,079
Go to bed, Tarly.

150
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:38,671
<i> Sorry, I can't open the
gate for anybody. Orders.</i>

151
00:11:38,705 --> 00:11:40,956
<i> You don't understand.
They killed everyone.</i>

152
00:11:41,007 --> 00:11:43,042
<i>Everyone but me and my baby.</i>

153
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:45,461
<i>They're out there.</i>
<i>I saw them on my way here.</i>

154
00:11:45,512 --> 00:11:47,753
<i>They may have seen me. 
They may have followed me. Please.</i>

155
00:11:47,764 --> 00:11:48,981
<i>I'm sorry, I can't.</i>

156
00:11:49,016 --> 00:11:50,549
<i> If they find us out here, 
you don't know...</i>

157
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,384
Pyp!
Open the gate.

158
00:11:52,435 --> 00:11:55,137
- I can't.
- Sam, is that you?

159
00:11:55,188 --> 00:11:57,106
Yes.

160
00:11:57,157 --> 00:11:59,191
Thorne gave me strict
orders to not open the gate.

161
00:11:59,193 --> 00:12:02,027
Oh, Pyp, open the fucking gate!

162
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,064
I never heard you curse before.

163
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:07,199
Yes, well, best get used to it.

164
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,124
Are you all right?

165
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:19,062
Shh, you're all right.

166
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:23,582
Yeah. Of course you are,
my brave little fella.

167
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:26,302
- It was horrible.
- I'm so, so sorry.

168
00:12:26,336 --> 00:12:28,137
I didn't know until I got back.

169
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:29,638
Don't let them
send me away, Sam.

170
00:12:29,673 --> 00:12:31,557
- Never.
- I know there's no women allowed.

171
00:12:31,591 --> 00:12:35,060
Anyone who tries to throw you out
will be having words with me.

172
00:12:35,095 --> 00:12:38,097
From now on, wherever you go,

173
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:40,999
I go, too.

174
00:12:50,694 --> 00:12:52,528
<i>Get ready!</i>

175
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:54,747
<i>-  Open the gate!
-  Ready yourselves!</i>

176
00:12:54,781 --> 00:12:56,832
<i>Make haste!</i>

177
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:58,951
<i>-  Prepare!
-  Up on the Wall!</i>

178
00:12:59,002 --> 00:13:00,563
<i>Quickly!
Up! Up!</i>

179
00:13:00,587 --> 00:13:03,789
<i>How many?
How many are there?</i>

180
00:13:06,126 --> 00:13:07,960
Beyond the trees!

181
00:13:11,798 --> 00:13:13,933
It's time.

182
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:03,599
Light them up!
Light them all!

183
00:14:12,943 --> 00:14:14,827
Move!

184
00:14:17,297 --> 00:14:18,831
Pick up the pace!

185
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:21,083
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

186
00:14:27,757 --> 00:14:30,342
Here we go, boys, there's one.

187
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:33,545
Let's go.
There's two.

188
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:38,034
Let's get the next load.

189
00:14:41,554 --> 00:14:44,056
That's the last
of the oil, Ser Alliser.

190
00:14:45,392 --> 00:14:48,193
100,000 you say?

191
00:14:48,228 --> 00:14:50,396
Yes, Ser.

192
00:14:50,398 --> 00:14:52,731
You can say it if you like.

193
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:56,618
We should have sealed the
tunnel while we had the chance,

194
00:14:56,653 --> 00:15:00,039
like you suggested.

195
00:15:00,073 --> 00:15:03,292
It was a difficult
decision either way, Ser.

196
00:15:05,462 --> 00:15:09,081
Do you know what leadership
means, Lord Snow?

197
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:12,217
It means that the person in
charge gets second-guessed

198
00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:14,837
by every clever little
twat with a mouth.

199
00:15:14,888 --> 00:15:17,256
But if he starts
second-guessing himself,

200
00:15:17,307 --> 00:15:19,091
that's the end...

201
00:15:19,142 --> 00:15:22,594
for him, for the
clever little twats,

202
00:15:22,596 --> 00:15:24,313
for everyone.

203
00:15:24,347 --> 00:15:27,316
This is not the end.
Not for us.

204
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,085
Not if you lot do your duty

205
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:32,071
for however long it takes
to beat them back.

206
00:15:33,523 --> 00:15:36,775
And then you get
to go on hating me

207
00:15:36,777 --> 00:15:38,244
and I get to go on wishing

208
00:15:38,246 --> 00:15:40,946
your wildling whore
had finished the job.

209
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:05,771
<i>You'll be safe down here.</i>

210
00:16:05,805 --> 00:16:07,689
I'll check on you
as soon as I can.

211
00:16:08,124 --> 00:16:10,642
You're leaving me again?

212
00:16:11,728 --> 00:16:13,362
I'm not leaving you.

213
00:16:13,396 --> 00:16:16,148
You're going up there and we're
staying down here. That's leaving.

214
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:18,567
You said from now on
we'd stay together.

215
00:16:18,618 --> 00:16:21,620
I... I didn't mean in the same room.

216
00:16:21,654 --> 00:16:22,988
What are you going
to do out there?

217
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,470
- Help my brothers.
- How?

218
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:28,043
You're going to fight the
free folk when they come?

219
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:30,913
They'll kill you. In Mole's Town, 
they killed everyone.

220
00:16:30,964 --> 00:16:34,550
I can't just hide here with you
while they're fighting out there.

221
00:16:34,584 --> 00:16:37,419
Why not? You won't
matter up there.

222
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,088
You will down here.

223
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,342
I am a man of
the Night's Watch, Gilly.

224
00:16:43,393 --> 00:16:45,677
I made a promise
to defend the Wall

225
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:47,513
and I have to keep it...

226
00:16:47,564 --> 00:16:50,149
because that's what men do.

227
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:05,030
Promise me you won't die.

228
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:11,203
I promise you I won't die.

229
00:17:45,121 --> 00:17:48,407
There's a lot more wildlings on the
other side of the Wall than this side.

230
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,577
We've got loads
of weapons and things.

231
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:53,495
It's the perfect place
for us to be.

232
00:17:53,546 --> 00:17:55,747
I've never thrown
a spear before.

233
00:17:55,749 --> 00:17:58,634
I've never held a sword
with a proper edge.

234
00:17:58,668 --> 00:18:01,336
This is no place for me to be.

235
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:04,723
You're not afraid?

236
00:18:04,757 --> 00:18:07,226
Of course I'm afraid.

237
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,761
There's a band of wildlings
coming to kill us.

238
00:18:09,763 --> 00:18:11,230
If you're afraid
of a band of wildlings,

239
00:18:11,264 --> 00:18:14,516
how in seven hells did you
manage to kill a white walker?

240
00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:22,658
I didn't know
I was going to kill it.

241
00:18:22,692 --> 00:18:25,444
But I had to do something.
I didn't have any choice.

242
00:18:25,446 --> 00:18:27,446
It was going to kill Gilly
and take the baby.

243
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:32,751
If someone had asked
me my name right then,

244
00:18:32,785 --> 00:18:34,453
I wouldn't have known.

245
00:18:36,206 --> 00:18:39,174
I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore.

246
00:18:39,209 --> 00:18:41,960
I wasn't a steward
in the Night's Watch

247
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:44,713
or son of Randyll Tarly
or any of that.

248
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:48,050
I was nothing at all.

249
00:18:49,936 --> 00:18:51,887
And when you're nothing at all,

250
00:18:51,938 --> 00:18:54,556
there's no more reason
to be afraid.

251
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:58,360
But you're afraid now?

252
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:00,862
Yes, well...

253
00:19:02,732 --> 00:19:04,816
I'm not nothing anymore.

254
00:19:24,087 --> 00:19:25,504
Most of their men are up top.

255
00:19:25,506 --> 00:19:28,840
Didn't count more than 20 down here.
Leftovers.

256
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:30,976
They got a big fat one and a
little bony one manning the front.

257
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,511
How high are the walls?

258
00:19:32,513 --> 00:19:35,513
Well, we'll be up and over before
they know what's happened.

259
00:19:36,516 --> 00:19:39,268
Let's kill some crows!

260
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:43,655
Come on!

261
00:20:00,206 --> 00:20:02,791
<i>Come on, brothers!</i>

262
00:21:17,699 --> 00:21:19,584
Archers nock.

263
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:21,782
Everyone else hold.

264
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,284
Grenn, no!

265
00:21:27,205 --> 00:21:30,123
I said nock and hold, you cunts!

266
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:33,210
- Does nock mean draw?
- No, Ser!

267
00:21:33,261 --> 00:21:36,513
- Does fucking hold mean fucking drop?
- No, Ser!

268
00:21:36,547 --> 00:21:39,766
- You all plan to die here tonight?
- No, Ser!

269
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:42,269
That's very good to hear.
Draw!

270
00:21:46,524 --> 00:21:48,558
No, down below!

271
00:21:58,236 --> 00:22:00,704
Draw!
Light them up.

272
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:17,838
Come on, get up!

273
00:22:17,889 --> 00:22:19,723
They're attacking
the southern gate!

274
00:22:19,757 --> 00:22:21,892
- Now?
- Now.

275
00:22:25,229 --> 00:22:28,982
I'm going down there. 
Brother Slynt, you have the Wall.

276
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:31,518
What?

277
00:22:31,569 --> 00:22:34,771
What are you fucking waiting for?
Loose!

278
00:22:34,822 --> 00:22:38,275
You heard the man.
Loose!

279
00:23:15,446 --> 00:23:16,980
You, over there.

280
00:23:21,903 --> 00:23:24,037
- Did you get one?
- No.

281
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,707
Ah, shit, Pyp!
Shit.

282
00:23:27,742 --> 00:23:29,376
- Sam.
- Yeah?

283
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,211
I think we're gonna die.

284
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:33,246
If you keep missing, we will.

285
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,225
Come on!
Come on!

286
00:23:49,897 --> 00:23:51,598
Brothers!

287
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,185
100 generations
have defended this castle.

288
00:23:55,236 --> 00:23:57,588
She's never fallen before.

289
00:23:57,622 --> 00:23:59,439
She will not fall tonight.

290
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:02,609
Those are Thenns at our walls.

291
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,945
They eat the flesh
of the men they kill.

292
00:24:04,996 --> 00:24:08,164
Do you want to fill
the belly of a Thenn tonight?

293
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:09,499
No!

294
00:24:09,534 --> 00:24:11,034
Tonight we fight.

295
00:24:11,085 --> 00:24:13,453
And when the sun rises,
I promise you,

296
00:24:13,504 --> 00:24:15,422
Castle Black will stand!

297
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,758
The Night's Watch will stand.

298
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:25,599
With me now!
Now with me!

299
00:25:21,656 --> 00:25:24,274
No discipline.
No training.

300
00:25:24,325 --> 00:25:27,110
Gang of thieves,
that's all this is.

301
00:25:27,161 --> 00:25:29,669
I commanded the City Watch
of King's Landing.

302
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:31,353
Those men obeyed orders.

303
00:25:31,473 --> 00:25:33,549
We can't just let them attack the gate!

304
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:37,004
The bars of those gates are
four inches of cold-rolled steel.

305
00:25:37,006 --> 00:25:39,507
Those are giants riding
mammoths down there!

306
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:42,009
Do you think your cold-rolled
steel is gonna stop them?

307
00:25:42,011 --> 00:25:43,311
No such thing as giants.

308
00:25:43,345 --> 00:25:46,013
A story for the children.

309
00:25:47,933 --> 00:25:49,817
Brother Slynt.

310
00:25:49,851 --> 00:25:52,653
We just got word that Ser Alliser 
needs you below.

311
00:25:54,523 --> 00:25:57,724
You're the most experienced man
he's got, Ser, and he needs you.

312
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,361
Needed below?

313
00:26:00,412 --> 00:26:02,580
Yes. Yes.

314
00:26:11,757 --> 00:26:15,259
Archers, nock your arrows!

315
00:26:15,294 --> 00:26:17,795
<i>Nock arrows!</i>

316
00:26:17,846 --> 00:26:19,547
Draw!

317
00:26:21,016 --> 00:26:23,184
Loose!

318
00:26:37,065 --> 00:26:40,315
- They won't summit before dawn.
- How do you know that?

319
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:42,401
Because I've made that climb.

320
00:26:42,452 --> 00:26:45,571
I think they're in a bigger
hurry than you were.

321
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:50,158
<i>Hold the bridge!</i>

322
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,327
<i>Hold, wait for it!</i>

323
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:55,214
<i>Come on with the rocks!</i>

324
00:27:00,837 --> 00:27:02,304
Nock!

325
00:27:04,224 --> 00:27:05,674
Draw!

326
00:27:09,345 --> 00:27:10,646
Loose!

327
00:27:29,616 --> 00:27:31,617
Down!

328
00:28:05,735 --> 00:28:08,236
No! No!

329
00:28:27,256 --> 00:28:28,840
To the gate.
Come on, let's move.

330
00:28:32,895 --> 00:28:34,179
It's gonna open.

331
00:29:38,995 --> 00:29:41,363
I got one, right through the heart.
He's dead.

332
00:29:41,414 --> 00:29:43,782
- Oh, is it over?
- No.

333
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:45,701
Well, then...

334
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:56,295
You're all right.
You're all right.

335
00:29:58,598 --> 00:29:59,966
I'll get help.

336
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,317
Shh. Shh.

337
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:04,853
Maester Aemon is coming.

338
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,805
He's gonna make it all right.

339
00:30:06,856 --> 00:30:10,142
Shh. Shh.

340
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:20,953
- Now.
- Now!

341
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:55,730
The outer gate won't hold.

342
00:31:55,732 --> 00:31:58,400
Take five men,
hold the inner gate.

343
00:31:58,434 --> 00:31:59,818
Aye.

344
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:04,455
Hold the gate.

345
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,791
If they make it through...

346
00:32:09,078 --> 00:32:10,962
They won't.

347
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:15,667
Come on, Hill.
And you, Cooper.

348
00:32:15,718 --> 00:32:18,887
You three, on me.

349
00:32:18,921 --> 00:32:21,222
Come on, you lazy bastards.

350
00:32:25,094 --> 00:32:27,095
Oil.

351
00:32:28,097 --> 00:32:30,231
Oil on the ramp!

352
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:41,609
Protect the gate!

353
00:33:14,643 --> 00:33:16,527
Get him inside.

354
00:33:20,649 --> 00:33:22,734
Hold the fucking gate!

355
00:33:22,785 --> 00:33:24,903
Hold it!

356
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:24,879
We need more men down here.

357
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,432
- We have to hold the gate.
- But we need men here.

358
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:29,717
Tell Jon.
He's in command.

359
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:32,186
Let's go.

360
00:34:39,812 --> 00:34:42,981
Get me to the top!
You hear me?!

361
00:34:47,486 --> 00:34:49,904
Your name's Olly, right?

362
00:34:49,906 --> 00:34:53,157
Listen to me, Olly.
Get me to the top.

363
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:56,488
And when we give the signal,
bring us back down.

364
00:34:57,379 --> 00:34:58,963
You hear me?

365
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,220
Find a weapon, Olly.
Fight them.

366
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:41,155
Clear the way!
Let's go!

367
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,291
- Out of the way!
- Get out of here!

368
00:36:00,726 --> 00:36:03,144
Cut the rope!

369
00:36:09,318 --> 00:36:11,819
Wait! No!

370
00:36:25,834 --> 00:36:27,885
<i>- We need more archers.
- Here I am.</i>

371
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,254
<i>- Come on.
- Quickly.</i>

372
00:36:32,474 --> 00:36:34,392
What are you doing up here?

373
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:36,928
The wildlings
are over the walls.

374
00:36:36,979 --> 00:36:38,763
Ser Alliser's fallen.

375
00:36:38,814 --> 00:36:41,482
The castle won't stand
much longer.

376
00:36:43,185 --> 00:36:46,154
Edd, you have the Wall.

377
00:36:48,407 --> 00:36:50,858
If they try the mammoths again, 
drop fire on them.

378
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:53,694
If the climbers get too high,
drop the scythe on them.

379
00:36:59,201 --> 00:37:02,370
Come, brothers.
Now fight with me!

380
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:06,257
Might as well enjoy
our last night, right, boys?

381
00:37:06,341 --> 00:37:08,259
Light the fuckers up!

382
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:11,462
Nock! Draw!

383
00:37:12,381 --> 00:37:14,632
Loose!

384
00:37:23,225 --> 00:37:24,392
How are we gonna stop that?

385
00:37:24,394 --> 00:37:25,726
Shot 20 arrows in him already.

386
00:37:25,728 --> 00:37:27,195
You heard Jon.
We hold the gate.

387
00:37:27,229 --> 00:37:28,646
Jon Snow's not Lord Commander.

388
00:37:28,697 --> 00:37:30,364
We hold the gate!

389
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:41,742
Mother, save me.
Father, save me.

390
00:37:41,744 --> 00:37:42,960
The gods aren't down here.

391
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:44,836
It's the six of us.
You hear me?

392
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,060
No, please.

393
00:37:51,086 --> 00:37:53,154
Night gathers
and now my watch begins.

394
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:55,723
It shall not end until my death.

395
00:37:55,757 --> 00:37:58,226
I shall take no wife,
hold no lands,

396
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,844
father no children.

397
00:37:59,895 --> 00:38:02,430
I shall wear no crown
and win no glory.

398
00:38:02,432 --> 00:38:04,649
I shall live and die at my post.

399
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:06,567
I am the sword
in the darkness.

400
00:38:06,602 --> 00:38:08,403
I am the watcher on the walls.

401
00:38:08,437 --> 00:38:11,439
I am the shield that guards
the realms of men.

402
00:38:11,441 --> 00:38:15,493
I pledge my life and honor
to the Night's Watch

403
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:18,196
for this night
and all the nights to come!

404
00:38:23,952 --> 00:38:25,419
I don't want you out there.

405
00:38:25,454 --> 00:38:27,672
You can't protect me forever.

406
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:30,291
There won't be anywhere
to hide if the castle falls.

407
00:38:33,128 --> 00:38:35,680
I need him more than I need you.

408
00:39:49,171 --> 00:39:51,706
We need you, boy.

409
00:40:13,812 --> 00:40:15,529
Ha!

410
00:42:10,595 --> 00:42:12,146
Jon Snow.

411
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:15,433
Hush.
Don't talk.

412
00:42:19,521 --> 00:42:22,022
Do you remember the cave?

413
00:42:26,445 --> 00:42:29,246
We should have
stayed in the cave.

414
00:42:33,201 --> 00:42:35,202
We'll go back there.

415
00:42:41,293 --> 00:42:44,628
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

416
00:43:19,881 --> 00:43:22,299
Drop the scythe, boys!

417
00:43:44,439 --> 00:43:46,941
- Hoist her up.
<i>- Hoist her up!</i>

418
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:54,949
They've had enough
for one night.

419
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,455
Don't cheer too loud.

420
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:05,876
They still outnumber us
1,000 to one.

421
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:15,936
Tormund.

422
00:44:15,971 --> 00:44:18,522
It's over.

423
00:44:18,557 --> 00:44:19,890
Let it end.

424
00:44:19,941 --> 00:44:22,226
This is how a man ends.

425
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:31,735
Put him in chains.

426
00:44:32,821 --> 00:44:34,655
We'll question him later.

427
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:39,793
I should have thrown you...

428
00:44:39,828 --> 00:44:42,830
from the top of the Wall, boy!

429
00:44:42,832 --> 00:44:44,882
Aye.

430
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:46,967
You should have.

431
00:44:54,092 --> 00:44:56,760
Whoa, it's me.
It's me.

432
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:02,433
I promised you, didn't I?

433
00:45:17,415 --> 00:45:19,116
We held them off.

434
00:45:19,167 --> 00:45:21,118
For one night.

435
00:45:21,169 --> 00:45:23,504
This is a great victory.

436
00:45:23,538 --> 00:45:25,706
A great victory?

437
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:29,510
Mance was testing our defenses.

438
00:45:29,544 --> 00:45:31,128
He almost made it through.

439
00:45:31,179 --> 00:45:33,964
And he has more giants.
He has more mammoths.

440
00:45:34,015 --> 00:45:36,717
He has 1,000 times as many men.

441
00:45:40,055 --> 00:45:42,640
They'll hit us again tonight.

442
00:45:42,691 --> 00:45:45,109
Maybe we can hold them
off for a day or two,

443
00:45:45,143 --> 00:45:47,183
but we'll never beat them.

444
00:45:48,113 --> 00:45:49,480
Where are we going?

445
00:45:49,531 --> 00:45:51,198
Going to find Mance.

446
00:45:51,232 --> 00:45:53,934
To fi...
you can't do that.

447
00:45:53,969 --> 00:45:55,819
No one gave you any orders.

448
00:45:57,572 --> 00:45:59,957
Who's left to give orders?

449
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:02,743
The wildling army's only
an army because of Mance.

450
00:46:02,745 --> 00:46:05,496
He united 100 warring tribes.

451
00:46:05,547 --> 00:46:07,581
Without Mance,
they lose their leader.

452
00:46:07,583 --> 00:46:10,300
They lose their purpose. 
They go back to fighting each other.

453
00:46:10,335 --> 00:46:12,136
Scatter back to their homes.

454
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:14,338
Without Mance?

455
00:46:14,389 --> 00:46:15,806
You're going to kill him?

456
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,141
I'm gonna try.

457
00:46:17,175 --> 00:46:19,009
They'll never let you
within 100 yards of him.

458
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:21,261
And even if they did, even
if you managed to kill him...

459
00:46:21,263 --> 00:46:23,847
They'll kill me? If I don't
go, they'll kill me anyway.

460
00:46:23,898 --> 00:46:25,315
They'll kill
the rest of us, too.

461
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,901
They won't just kill you.

462
00:46:27,936 --> 00:46:29,770
They'll boil you.
They'll flay you.

463
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:31,321
They'll make it last days.

464
00:46:34,109 --> 00:46:37,661
You're right.
It's a bad plan.

465
00:46:39,664 --> 00:46:41,699
What's your plan?

466
00:47:24,993 --> 00:47:27,161
They held the gate.

467
00:47:36,387 --> 00:47:38,972
Get some brothers
down here to help you.

468
00:47:41,092 --> 00:47:43,393
We need to burn the bodies.

469
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:07,201
Raise the outer gate.

470
00:48:07,252 --> 00:48:09,787
Then lower it again
as soon as I'm out.

471
00:48:21,216 --> 00:48:22,716
What are you doing?

472
00:48:22,718 --> 00:48:25,435
I promised Mormont
I'd never lose it again.

473
00:48:29,774 --> 00:48:31,942
In case I don't come back.

474
00:48:39,734 --> 00:48:41,785
Jon.

475
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:48,242
Come back.

476
00:49:11,327 --> 00:49:19,327
