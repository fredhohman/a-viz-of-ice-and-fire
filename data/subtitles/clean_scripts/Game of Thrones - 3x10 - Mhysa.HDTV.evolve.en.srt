1
00:00:01,488 --> 00:00:03,775
You will release
every slave in Yunkai.

2
00:00:03,809 --> 00:00:07,162
Reject this gift and I shall
show you no mercy.

3
00:00:07,196 --> 00:00:10,015
- You are mad.
- It was just as you said.

4
00:00:10,049 --> 00:00:13,568
Their slave soldiers threw down
their spears and surrendered.

5
00:00:13,603 --> 00:00:17,127
<i>- The bitch stays.</i>
- I'm taking her to King's Landing.

6
00:00:17,162 --> 00:00:19,779
Unless you kill me.

7
00:00:19,813 --> 00:00:22,625
Well, we must be on our way.

8
00:00:22,659 --> 00:00:24,737
- Please.
- I'm not killing you.

9
00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:27,188
Just making a few
alterations.

10
00:00:27,222 --> 00:00:28,594
No! Don't!

11
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,739
The Nightfort's closest
to Castle Black.

12
00:00:30,774 --> 00:00:32,989
It's got a secret
sally port,

13
00:00:33,023 --> 00:00:35,201
the Black Gate,
as old as the Wall itself.

14
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:38,317
It leads through the Wall
right down into the Nightfort.

15
00:00:38,352 --> 00:00:41,034
- Stop.
- But your father--

16
00:00:41,069 --> 00:00:44,384
I won't share your bed.
Not until you want me to.

17
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,228
What if I never
want you to?

18
00:00:46,262 --> 00:00:48,606
And so my watch begins.

19
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,632
He's a crow. He'll stab us in
the back first chance he gets.

20
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,909
Kill him.

21
00:00:55,947 --> 00:00:58,490
The wolves are out there.
You're a warg, Bran.

22
00:00:58,525 --> 00:00:59,896
<i>Do it.</i>

23
00:01:10,617 --> 00:01:13,730
I'm going beyond the Wall.
It won't be safe for Rickon.

24
00:01:13,764 --> 00:01:15,105
I'm coming with you.

25
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,219
You and Osha and Shaggydog
head for the Last Hearth.

26
00:01:18,254 --> 00:01:20,295
- She's going to kill him.
- Sacrifice him.

27
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,533
<i>The boy is your nephew.</i>

28
00:01:21,568 --> 00:01:23,876
The usurper Robb Stark.

29
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,556
<i>She says there's power</i>
<i>in king's blood.</i>

30
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,264
Got salt pork
for the feast.

31
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:30,773
The feast is over.

32
00:01:30,808 --> 00:01:31,911
Robb!

33
00:01:33,153 --> 00:01:35,024
Mother.

34
00:01:35,058 --> 00:01:37,736
The Lannisters send their regards.

35
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:41,186
It's too late.

<i>- Go, move out!</i>
<i>-  The King in the North!</i>

The King in the North!
The King in the North!

The King in the North!
The King in the North!

Here comes
the King in the North!

44
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:43,336
Here comes the King

<i>The King in the North!</i>
<i>The King in the North!</i>

46

Here comes...

47
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,699
Hmm.

48
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:21,335
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

49
00:05:21,369 --> 00:05:23,803
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

50
00:05:23,838 --> 00:05:25,404
What are you doing?

51
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:27,306
I have a list.

52
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,374
A list of people
you mean to kill?

53
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:30,675
For laughing at me?

54
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,811
Do I look like
Joffrey to you?

55
00:05:32,845 --> 00:05:34,779
No, death seems
a bit extreme.

56
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:36,880
Fear of death,
on the other hand...

57
00:05:36,948 --> 00:05:38,482
You should learn
to ignore them.

58
00:05:38,516 --> 00:05:40,651
My lady, people have
been laughing at me

59
00:05:40,685 --> 00:05:42,486
far longer than they've
been laughing at you.

60
00:05:42,553 --> 00:05:44,454
I'm the Halfman,

61
00:05:44,488 --> 00:05:46,523
the Demon Monkey,
the Imp.

62
00:05:46,557 --> 00:05:48,091
You're a Lannister.

63
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:51,661
I am the disgraced daughter
of the traitor Ned Stark.

64
00:05:51,695 --> 00:05:54,429
The disgraced daughter
and the Demon Monkey.

65
00:05:54,464 --> 00:05:56,797
We're perfect for each other.

66
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:01,969
So how should
we punish them?

67
00:06:02,036 --> 00:06:03,604
Who? Whom?

68
00:06:03,638 --> 00:06:06,673
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

69
00:06:06,707 --> 00:06:08,341
Ah.

70
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,811
I could speak to Lord Varys
and learn their perversions.

71
00:06:11,845 --> 00:06:15,314
Anyone named Desmond
Crakehall must be a pervert.

72
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:17,783
I hear that
you're a pervert.

73
00:06:17,817 --> 00:06:19,084
I am the Imp.

74
00:06:19,118 --> 00:06:20,852
I have certain standards
to maintain.

75
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:26,357
We could sheep shift
Lord Desmond's bed.

76
00:06:27,525 --> 00:06:29,193
You cut a little hole
in his mattress

77
00:06:29,227 --> 00:06:31,061
and you stuff
sheep dung inside.

78
00:06:31,095 --> 00:06:33,963
Then you sew up the hole
and make his bed again.

79
00:06:33,998 --> 00:06:36,899
His room will stink, but he won't
know where it's coming from.

80
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:38,434
Lady Sansa!

81
00:06:38,468 --> 00:06:40,903
My sister used to do that
when she was angry with me.

82
00:06:40,937 --> 00:06:43,438
And she was always
angry with me.

83
00:06:43,473 --> 00:06:45,540
Why sheep <i>shift?</i>

84
00:06:45,575 --> 00:06:48,976
That's the vulgar word
for dung.

85
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:50,945
My lady...

86
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:52,280
Well, you asked me.

87
00:06:52,314 --> 00:06:53,681
Oh!

88
00:06:53,716 --> 00:06:55,283
That's him!

89
00:06:56,418 --> 00:06:58,418
My lord, my lady.

90
00:06:58,453 --> 00:07:00,754
Your father has called
a meeting of the small council.

91
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:11,164
Killed a few
puppies today?

92
00:07:11,232 --> 00:07:13,132
Show him.

93
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,134
Come on, show him.

94
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:22,407
Oh, apologies, my lord.

95
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:24,376
Old fingers.

96
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,553
"Roslin caught
a fine fat trout.

97
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:39,590
<i>Her brothers gave her</i>
<i>a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding.</i>

98
00:07:39,624 --> 00:07:42,426
<i>Signed Walder Frey."</i>

99
00:07:44,228 --> 00:07:46,162
Is that bad poetry

100
00:07:46,197 --> 00:07:48,297
or is it supposed
to mean something?

101
00:07:48,332 --> 00:07:50,132
Robb Stark is dead.

102
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:53,468
<i>And his bitch mother.</i>

103
00:07:54,971 --> 00:07:56,337
Write back to Lord Frey.

104
00:07:56,372 --> 00:07:59,040
<i>Thank him for his service</i>
<i>and command him</i>

105
00:07:59,074 --> 00:08:01,776
to send Robb Stark's head.

106
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,012
I'm going to serve it to Sansa
at my wedding feast.

107
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:08,581
Your Grace, Lady Sansa
is your aunt by marriage.

108
00:08:08,616 --> 00:08:11,150
A joke.
Joffrey did not mean it.

109
00:08:11,185 --> 00:08:12,785
Yes, I did.

110
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:15,654
I'm going to have it served
to Sansa at my wedding feast.

111
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:17,222
<i>No.</i>

112
00:08:17,256 --> 00:08:19,791
She is no longer
yours to torment.

113
00:08:20,726 --> 00:08:23,594
Everyone is mine
to torment.

114
00:08:25,063 --> 00:08:27,864
You'd do well to remember that,
you little monster.

115
00:08:27,932 --> 00:08:29,732
Oh, I'm a monster.

116
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:33,301
Perhaps you should speak
to me more softly, then.

117
00:08:33,336 --> 00:08:35,637
<i>Monsters are dangerous</i>

118
00:08:35,671 --> 00:08:39,673
and just now kings
are dying like flies.

119
00:08:46,981 --> 00:08:49,215
I could have
your tongue out

120
00:08:49,249 --> 00:08:50,749
<i>for saying that.</i>

121
00:08:50,817 --> 00:08:53,685
Let him make his threats.

122
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:56,788
Hmm? He's a bitter
little man.

123
00:08:56,822 --> 00:08:59,924
Lord Tyrion should
apologize immediately.

124
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,993
Unacceptable,
disrespectful,

125
00:09:03,027 --> 00:09:05,161
<i>and in very bad taste.</i>

126
00:09:05,195 --> 00:09:07,997
I am the king!

127
00:09:08,031 --> 00:09:09,565
I will punish you.

128
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:12,100
Any man who must say,
"I am the king"

129
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,769
is no true king.

130
00:09:14,803 --> 00:09:16,704
I'll make sure
you understand that

131
00:09:16,738 --> 00:09:18,272
when I've won
your war for you.

132
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,975
My father won
the real war.

133
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:24,078
He killed Prince Rhaegar.
He took the crown

134
00:09:24,112 --> 00:09:26,881
while you hid
under Casterly Rock!

135
00:09:39,627 --> 00:09:41,494
The king is tired.

136
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:43,696
See him to his chambers.

137
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,965
- Come along.
- I'm not tired.

138
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:48,701
We have so much
to celebrate.

139
00:09:48,735 --> 00:09:51,803
A wedding to plan.
You must rest.

140
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:56,675
Grand Maester, perhaps
some essence of nightshade

141
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:59,177
to help him sleep.

142
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:02,612
I'm not tired!

143
00:10:04,148 --> 00:10:06,048
Come.

144
00:10:26,165 --> 00:10:28,299
Not you.

145
00:10:35,306 --> 00:10:37,873
You just sent the most
powerful man in Westeros

146
00:10:37,907 --> 00:10:40,242
to bed without his supper.

147
00:10:40,276 --> 00:10:43,945
You're a fool if you believe he's
the most powerful man in Westeros.

148
00:10:43,979 --> 00:10:46,880
A treasonous statement.
Joffrey is king.

149
00:10:46,948 --> 00:10:49,850
You really think a crown
gives you power?

150
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,453
No.

151
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:56,288
I think armies
give you power.

152
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:59,124
- Mm-hmm.
- Robb Stark had one,

153
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,092
never lost a battle,

154
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,361
and you defeated him
all the same.

155
00:11:03,395 --> 00:11:06,563
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I know.

156
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:09,532
Walder Frey
gets all the credit.

157
00:11:09,566 --> 00:11:11,467
Or the blame,
I suppose,

158
00:11:11,501 --> 00:11:13,368
depending on
your allegiance.

159
00:11:14,737 --> 00:11:16,638
<i>Walder Frey</i>
<i>is many things,</i>

160
00:11:16,672 --> 00:11:18,772
but a brave man?

161
00:11:18,807 --> 00:11:20,174
No.

162
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:23,543
He never would have
risked such an action

163
00:11:23,578 --> 00:11:26,079
if he didn't have
certain assurances.

164
00:11:26,147 --> 00:11:28,848
Which he got from me.

165
00:11:28,882 --> 00:11:30,783
Do you disapprove?

166
00:11:30,817 --> 00:11:32,852
<i>I'm all for cheating.</i>
<i>This is war.</i>

167
00:11:32,886 --> 00:11:35,054
But to slaughter them
at a wedding...

168
00:11:35,088 --> 00:11:37,789
Explain to me
why it is more noble

169
00:11:37,824 --> 00:11:39,891
to kill 10,000 men
in battle

170
00:11:39,926 --> 00:11:41,226
than a dozen at dinner.

171
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,261
So that's why you did it?

172
00:11:43,296 --> 00:11:44,963
To save lives?

173
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:47,999
To end the war.
To protect the family.

174
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:50,901
<i>Do you want to write a song</i>
<i>for the dead Starks?</i>

175
00:11:50,936 --> 00:11:53,770
Go ahead, write one.

176
00:11:53,805 --> 00:11:57,340
<i>I'm in this world</i>
<i>a little while longer</i>

177
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:01,144
to defend the Lannisters,
to defend my blood.

178
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,780
The northerners
will never forget.

179
00:12:03,814 --> 00:12:05,181
Good.

180
00:12:05,216 --> 00:12:06,883
Let them remember
what happens

181
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:09,252
when they march
on the south.

182
00:12:11,722 --> 00:12:13,990
All the Stark men
are dead.

183
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,859
Winterfell is a ruin.

184
00:12:16,893 --> 00:12:20,762
Roose Bolton will be named
Warden of the North

185
00:12:20,796 --> 00:12:25,766
until your son by Sansa
comes of age.

186
00:12:28,736 --> 00:12:32,271
I believe you still have some
work to do on that score.

187
00:12:33,806 --> 00:12:36,774
Do you think she'll open
her legs for me

188
00:12:36,808 --> 00:12:40,211
after I tell her how we murdered
her mother and brother?

189
00:12:40,245 --> 00:12:43,580
One way or another,
you will get that girl pregnant.

190
00:12:43,615 --> 00:12:46,116
I will not rape her.

191
00:12:47,618 --> 00:12:50,553
Shall I explain to you in one
easy lesson how the world works?

192
00:12:50,588 --> 00:12:53,689
Use small words.
I'm not as bright as you.

193
00:12:53,724 --> 00:12:56,759
The house that puts family
first will always defeat

194
00:12:56,793 --> 00:12:59,194
the house that puts
the whims and wishes

195
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:02,463
<i>of its sons</i>
<i>and daughters first.</i>

196
00:13:02,498 --> 00:13:04,899
A good man does
everything in his power

197
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:08,101
to better
his family's position

198
00:13:08,136 --> 00:13:11,671
regardless of his own
selfish desires.

199
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:16,841
Does that amuse you?

200
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:19,744
No, it's a very
good lesson.

201
00:13:19,778 --> 00:13:23,080
Only it's easy for you to
preach utter devotion to family

202
00:13:23,114 --> 00:13:25,715
when you're making
all the decisions.

203
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,617
Easy for me, is it?

204
00:13:27,651 --> 00:13:30,920
When have you ever done something
that wasn't in your interest

205
00:13:30,955 --> 00:13:33,288
but solely for the benefit
of the family?

206
00:13:33,323 --> 00:13:36,157
The day
that you were born.

207
00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:42,496
I wanted to carry you
into the sea

208
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,831
and let the waves
wash you away.

209
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:49,634
Instead, I let you live.

210
00:13:50,736 --> 00:13:53,203
And I brought you up
as my son.

211
00:13:57,207 --> 00:13:59,008
Because you're a Lannister.

212
00:14:14,724 --> 00:14:16,325
Sansa.

213
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:46,952
It's empty.

214
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,620
Let's find
a place to sleep.

215
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,330
Hodor.

216
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:03,233
Hodor.

217
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:05,969
Don't, Hodor.

218
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,174
Maybe we shouldn't
stay here.

219
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,843
You'd rather
be out there?

220
00:15:14,877 --> 00:15:17,812
There are a lot of stories
about this place.

221
00:15:19,081 --> 00:15:20,547
Horrible stories.

222
00:15:20,582 --> 00:15:22,716
I always quite liked
the horrible stories.

223
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:25,018
So did I.

224
00:15:25,052 --> 00:15:26,886
Once.

225
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:31,157
You ever heard
about the Rat Cook?

226
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:33,425
No.
Who's he?

227
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,628
Just a cook
in the Night's Watch.

228
00:15:36,662 --> 00:15:39,097
He was angry at the king
for something,

229
00:15:39,131 --> 00:15:41,032
I don't remember.

230
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:43,834
When the king was visiting
the Nightfort,

231
00:15:43,868 --> 00:15:46,369
the cook killed
the king's son,

232
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,304
cooked him
into a big pie

233
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:51,841
with onions, carrots,
mushrooms and bacon.

234
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:55,844
That night he served
the pie to the king.

235
00:15:55,878 --> 00:15:58,580
He liked the taste
of his son so much,

236
00:15:58,614 --> 00:16:01,015
he asked for
a second slice.

237
00:16:03,118 --> 00:16:06,219
The gods turned the cook
into a giant white rat

238
00:16:06,254 --> 00:16:08,654
<i>who could only eat</i>
<i>his own young.</i>

239
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:11,957
<i>He's been roaming</i>
<i>the Nightfort ever since,</i>

240
00:16:11,992 --> 00:16:14,293
<i>devouring his own babies.</i>

241
00:16:15,295 --> 00:16:18,463
But no matter
what he does,

242
00:16:18,498 --> 00:16:20,465
he's always hungry.

243
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,768
If the gods turned
every killer

244
00:16:23,802 --> 00:16:25,136
into a giant white rat--

245
00:16:25,203 --> 00:16:27,437
It wasn't for murder
the gods cursed the Rat Cook

246
00:16:27,472 --> 00:16:29,806
<i>or for serving</i>
<i>the king's son in a pie.</i>

247
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:32,175
He killed a guest
beneath his roof.

248
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:36,612
That's something
the gods can't forgive.

249
00:16:44,219 --> 00:16:47,955
"The late Walder Frey,"
old Tully called me

250
00:16:48,023 --> 00:16:51,658
because I didn't get my men to
the Trident in time for battle.

251
00:16:51,726 --> 00:16:53,994
<i>He thought he was witty.</i>

252
00:16:54,028 --> 00:16:56,229
<i>Look at us now, Tully.</i>

253
00:16:56,264 --> 00:16:59,266
<i>You're dead,</i>
<i>your daughter's dead,</i>

254
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,867
your grandson's dead,

255
00:17:00,902 --> 00:17:04,070
your son spent his wedding
night in a dungeon

256
00:17:04,105 --> 00:17:06,906
and I'm Lord
of Riverrun.

257
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:10,610
The Blackfish escaped.

258
00:17:12,145 --> 00:17:14,313
An old man on the run

259
00:17:14,348 --> 00:17:16,783
<i>with no allies.</i>

260
00:17:16,817 --> 00:17:18,818
I have Tywin Lannister
backing me.

261
00:17:18,852 --> 00:17:21,854
- Who does he have?
- As you say.

262
00:17:21,888 --> 00:17:23,522
<i>They all laughed at me,</i>

263
00:17:23,556 --> 00:17:25,490
all those high lords.

264
00:17:25,524 --> 00:17:28,559
They all thought
they were better than me.

265
00:17:28,594 --> 00:17:31,328
Ned Stark,
Hoster Tully.

266
00:17:31,396 --> 00:17:34,898
People snigger
when I marry a young girl,

267
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:38,301
but who said a word when Jon Arryn
married the little Tully bitch?

268
00:17:38,335 --> 00:17:40,370
You'll be needing
a new young girl.

269
00:17:40,404 --> 00:17:42,505
Yeah.

270
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:45,207
Got that
to look forward to.

271
00:17:46,576 --> 00:17:48,043
<i>And you,</i>

272
00:17:48,077 --> 00:17:50,245
the Warden
of the North.

273
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,581
<i>No more Starks</i>
<i>to bow and scrape to.</i>

274
00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:55,283
Must have been torture

275
00:17:55,317 --> 00:17:57,385
following that stupid boy
all over the country.

276
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:00,588
He ignored my advice
at every turn.

277
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:02,657
If he'd been a trifle
less arrogant...

278
00:18:02,691 --> 00:18:05,192
Calling himself
the Young Wolf.

279
00:18:05,227 --> 00:18:06,960
How's that for pomposity?

280
00:18:08,562 --> 00:18:11,864
Well, here's to
the Young Wolf!

281
00:18:11,898 --> 00:18:14,633
Forever young.

282
00:18:20,372 --> 00:18:23,040
Will you move to Winterfell
now that the war's over?

283
00:18:23,074 --> 00:18:25,575
At some point perhaps.

284
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,777
But Winterfell's in ruins.

285
00:18:27,811 --> 00:18:30,612
Yeah.

286
00:18:30,647 --> 00:18:32,447
What happened up there?

287
00:18:32,481 --> 00:18:35,516
I heard the Greyjoy boy
seized the place.

288
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:38,085
I heard he killed
all the ravens.

289
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,587
And after that, nothing.

290
00:18:40,655 --> 00:18:43,590
I sent my bastard Ramsay
to root him out.

291
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:47,127
Robb Stark offered
amnesty for the ironborn

292
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:48,995
if they gave us Theon.

293
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,997
Oh. And?

294
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:52,598
<i>Ramsay delivered</i>
<i>the terms.</i>

295
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:56,768
The ironborn turned on Theon
as we knew they would.

296
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,971
<i>They handed him over</i>
<i>trussed and hooded.</i>

297
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:04,074
<i>But Ramsay-- well...</i>

298
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,710
<i>Ramsay has his own way</i>
<i>of doing things.</i>

299
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:09,646
Well, the girls
weren't lying.

300
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,581
You had
a good-sized cock.

301
00:19:20,056 --> 00:19:21,722
What?

302
00:19:21,757 --> 00:19:23,157
No.

303
00:19:25,327 --> 00:19:27,895
Pork sausage.

304
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:30,263
You think I'm some
sort of savage?

305
00:19:41,674 --> 00:19:45,309
People talk about
phantom limbs.

306
00:19:45,343 --> 00:19:48,678
<i>An amputee might have an itch</i>
<i>where his foot used to be.</i>

307
00:19:48,713 --> 00:19:51,047
<i>So I've always wondered...</i>

308
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:57,520
do eunuchs
have a phantom cock?

309
00:19:59,422 --> 00:20:01,557
<i>Next time you think</i>
<i>about naked girls,</i>

310
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:04,126
would you feel an itch?

311
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:14,068
Sorry.

312
00:20:15,203 --> 00:20:17,004
I shouldn't make jokes.

313
00:20:18,573 --> 00:20:21,575
My mother taught me not
to throw stones at cripples.

314
00:20:25,145 --> 00:20:28,681
But my father taught me
to aim for their head.

315
00:20:28,715 --> 00:20:30,783
Kill me.

316
00:20:30,817 --> 00:20:32,718
Sorry, what?

317
00:20:34,087 --> 00:20:35,854
Kill me.

318
00:20:37,556 --> 00:20:39,123
A little louder.

319
00:20:39,158 --> 00:20:42,193
Kill me!

320
00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:46,129
You're no good
to me dead.

321
00:20:46,164 --> 00:20:48,598
We need you.

322
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:12,053
You don't look like
a Theon Greyjoy anymore.

323
00:21:13,454 --> 00:21:15,621
That's a name
for a lord.

324
00:21:16,823 --> 00:21:18,891
But you're not a lord,

325
00:21:18,925 --> 00:21:21,159
are you?

326
00:21:21,194 --> 00:21:24,062
You're just meat.

327
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,499
Stinking meat.

328
00:21:32,636 --> 00:21:35,004
You reek.

329
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:37,807
Reek!

330
00:21:37,841 --> 00:21:40,042
That's a good name
for you.

331
00:21:41,245 --> 00:21:43,846
What's your name?

332
00:21:43,881 --> 00:21:46,115
Theon Greyjoy.

333
00:21:51,187 --> 00:21:53,288
What's your name?

334
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:57,158
Th--

335
00:21:57,193 --> 00:21:59,660
Theon Greyjoy.

336
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:07,901
Please.

337
00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:12,939
What is your name?!

338
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,941
Reek.

339
00:22:19,378 --> 00:22:20,812
My name is...

340
00:22:22,648 --> 00:22:24,748
Reek.

341
00:22:50,738 --> 00:22:54,074
Hodor.

342
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:26,638
- Don't kill me!
- Who are you?

343
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:29,374
- Sam! Sam!
- Who are you?!

344
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,310
Gilly.
Don't hurt us.

345
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,111
Where are you going?

346
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:37,681
To Castle Black. I'm a brother
of the Night's Watch.

347
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:40,016
- My brother, he's in the Night's--
- Shush.

348
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,784
- Who's your brother?
- Doesn't matter.

349
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:53,160
You're Jon's brother.

350
00:23:53,194 --> 00:23:55,128
<i>The one who fell</i>
<i>from the window.</i>

351
00:23:55,162 --> 00:23:57,296
No, I'm not.

352
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:01,867
I've been around Ghost enough to
know a direwolf when I see one.

353
00:24:01,901 --> 00:24:04,035
And I've heard
all about Hodor.

354
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,937
Hodor.

355
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,042
I'd be dead
if it wasn't for Jon.

356
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:13,110
If you're his brother,
you're my brother, too.

357
00:24:13,144 --> 00:24:15,479
And anything I can do
to help you, I will.

358
00:24:15,514 --> 00:24:17,882
Take us north
of the Wall.

359
00:24:23,188 --> 00:24:24,522
What?

360
00:24:24,556 --> 00:24:26,490
Why in the world
would you want to go--

361
00:24:26,524 --> 00:24:28,859
I don't want to.
I have to.

362
00:24:28,893 --> 00:24:30,661
How did you get
through the Wall?

363
00:24:30,695 --> 00:24:33,597
Does the well lead to an underground river?
Is that how you came here?

364
00:24:33,631 --> 00:24:36,066
Come with us.

365
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:39,970
There are steps carved into
the south side of the Wall.

366
00:24:40,004 --> 00:24:41,571
Hodor can carry you
to the top.

367
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,672
We'll walk straight
to Castle Black.

368
00:24:43,707 --> 00:24:47,142
Come with us.
There's nothing north but death.

369
00:24:47,177 --> 00:24:49,544
<i>If Jon is alive,</i>

370
00:24:49,579 --> 00:24:51,246
<i>then Castle Black's</i>
<i>where he'll be.</i>

371
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,214
It's the safest place
for you.

372
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,882
There's nowhere safe any longer.
You know that.

373
00:24:55,917 --> 00:24:59,452
What I know
is what I saw.

374
00:24:59,486 --> 00:25:01,487
And if you saw it, too,
you'd run the other way.

375
00:25:01,521 --> 00:25:04,957
You saw the white walkers
and the army of the dead.

376
00:25:05,925 --> 00:25:07,425
How do you know
all that?

377
00:25:07,459 --> 00:25:09,993
The Night's Watch
can't stop them.

378
00:25:10,028 --> 00:25:13,630
The kings of Westeros and all
their armies can't stop them.

379
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:24,840
But you're going
to stop them?

380
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:27,509
Please, Sam.

381
00:25:27,544 --> 00:25:29,578
<i>I have to go north.</i>

382
00:25:31,146 --> 00:25:33,014
I have to.

383
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:04,205
"Balon Greyjoy,
Lord of the Iron Islands

384
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:06,507
and invader of the North.

385
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:08,508
I give you
until the full moon

386
00:26:08,543 --> 00:26:11,811
to order all ironborn scum
out of the North

387
00:26:11,846 --> 00:26:14,881
<i>and back to those</i>
<i>shit-stained rocks</i>

388
00:26:14,915 --> 00:26:17,083
<i>you call a home.</i>

389
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,985
<i>On the first night</i>
<i>of the full moon,</i>

390
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,488
<i>I will hunt down</i>
<i>every islander</i>

391
00:26:22,522 --> 00:26:27,058
still in our lands
and flay them living

392
00:26:27,093 --> 00:26:30,561
the way I flayed
the 20 ironborn scum

393
00:26:30,596 --> 00:26:32,396
I found at Winterfell.

394
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:36,033
<i>In the box you'll find</i>
<i>a special gift--</i>

395
00:26:37,101 --> 00:26:40,170
Theon's favorite toy.

396
00:26:40,204 --> 00:26:43,539
He cried when I took it
away from him.

397
00:27:03,657 --> 00:27:07,894
Leave the North now
or more boxes will follow

398
00:27:07,928 --> 00:27:10,496
with more Theon.

399
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:12,831
Signed Ramsay Snow,

400
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:14,498
natural-born son
of Roose Bolton,

401
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:17,501
Lord of the Dreadfort
and Warden of the North."

402
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,706
Get that
out of my sight.

403
00:27:28,311 --> 00:27:31,980
Theon disobeyed
my orders.

404
00:27:35,485 --> 00:27:37,853
The boy is a fool.

405
00:27:40,356 --> 00:27:43,525
He cannot further
the Greyjoy line.

406
00:27:44,927 --> 00:27:48,229
I will not give up
the lands I have seized,

407
00:27:48,264 --> 00:27:50,431
the strongholds
I have taken.

408
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:52,233
Get this away from me.

409
00:27:53,202 --> 00:27:54,669
He's your son.

410
00:27:54,703 --> 00:27:57,538
Son?

411
00:27:57,572 --> 00:28:00,340
He's not
a man anymore.

412
00:28:00,374 --> 00:28:01,942
He's your son.

413
00:28:01,976 --> 00:28:05,445
He's my brother.

414
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:06,712
He's a Greyjoy.

415
00:28:06,747 --> 00:28:08,981
Watch yourself.

416
00:28:09,015 --> 00:28:11,349
I've made
my decision.

417
00:28:16,287 --> 00:28:18,421
And I've made mine.

418
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:24,593
I'm going to pick the
fastest ship in our fleet.

419
00:28:26,829 --> 00:28:30,197
<i>I'm going to choose</i>
<i>the 50 best killers on the Iron Islands.</i>

420
00:28:30,232 --> 00:28:32,833
Get those ropes!

421
00:28:32,867 --> 00:28:34,734
<i>I'm going to sail</i>
<i>up the Narrow Sea</i>

422
00:28:34,768 --> 00:28:37,102
<i>all the way</i>
<i>to the Weeping Water.</i>

423
00:28:38,304 --> 00:28:41,440
<i>I'm going to march</i>
<i>on the Dreadfort.</i>

424
00:28:41,474 --> 00:28:44,208
<i>I'm going to find</i>
<i>my little brother</i>

425
00:28:44,243 --> 00:28:47,145
<i>and I'm going</i>
<i>to bring him home.</i>

426
00:28:52,784 --> 00:28:54,418
What is it?

427
00:28:54,452 --> 00:28:55,986
Dragonglass.

428
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,888
We found them
at the Fist.

429
00:28:57,922 --> 00:29:01,424
Someone buried them
a long time ago.

430
00:29:01,459 --> 00:29:03,593
Someone wanted us
to find them.

431
00:29:03,627 --> 00:29:07,463
Why?
What are they for?

432
00:29:11,901 --> 00:29:13,669
Killing white walkers.

433
00:29:13,703 --> 00:29:15,137
How do you know that?

434
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:17,806
<i>The walker came</i>
<i>for my baby.</i>

435
00:29:18,707 --> 00:29:20,208
And Sam...

436
00:29:20,242 --> 00:29:23,444
But no one's killed a white
walker in thousands of years.

437
00:29:23,478 --> 00:29:27,447
Well, I suppose someone
had to be the first.

438
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:29,649
Take it, Hodor.

439
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:38,223
And the archer.

440
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:46,298
I got lucky

441
00:29:46,332 --> 00:29:48,567
with one of them.

442
00:29:48,601 --> 00:29:50,235
There are more.

443
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,838
<i>Many more.</i>

444
00:29:53,872 --> 00:29:56,373
And for every one of them,

445
00:29:56,408 --> 00:29:58,909
the dead men,

446
00:29:58,943 --> 00:30:00,844
more than you
could count.

447
00:30:04,348 --> 00:30:06,549
I wish you'd come
with us.

448
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:09,051
I wish I could.

449
00:30:10,821 --> 00:30:12,755
I really do.

450
00:31:00,196 --> 00:31:02,931
How are you keeping?

451
00:31:02,965 --> 00:31:04,765
Great.

452
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,266
Never better.

453
00:31:06,301 --> 00:31:08,869
It was just
a bit of blood.

454
00:31:09,737 --> 00:31:11,705
I should have known.

455
00:31:11,739 --> 00:31:14,307
Every time a highborn
asks my name, it's trouble.

456
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:17,142
We're not really people
to you, are we?

457
00:31:17,177 --> 00:31:18,978
Just a million different ways
to get what you want.

458
00:31:19,012 --> 00:31:21,679
- I'm not a highborn.
- She called you Ser.

459
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:23,582
I heard it.

460
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:28,118
A recent state
of affairs.

461
00:31:31,622 --> 00:31:35,124
I was born in Flea Bottom
just like you.

462
00:31:35,158 --> 00:31:37,326
Sure, you were.

463
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,160
You're my friend.
You're here to help.

464
00:31:39,195 --> 00:31:41,128
I lived below
the Street of Flour.

465
00:31:41,163 --> 00:31:42,563
<i>How far below?</i>

466
00:31:42,597 --> 00:31:44,764
How close to the
Red Keep were you?

467
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:48,634
The shit that poured
from their privy pipes

468
00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:52,404
<i>flowed down the side</i>
<i>of Aegon's Hill</i>

469
00:31:52,438 --> 00:31:56,473
along Tanner's Row and right
in front of my front door

470
00:31:56,507 --> 00:31:58,642
- on Gin Alley.
- Gin Alley.

471
00:32:01,345 --> 00:32:03,278
The Street of Steel,

472
00:32:03,313 --> 00:32:06,615
with your armor and your knights?
Pfft.

473
00:32:06,649 --> 00:32:09,083
You lived in the fancy
part of town.

474
00:32:13,088 --> 00:32:15,923
And here we are now.

475
00:32:15,957 --> 00:32:19,527
Two boys from Flea Bottom
in the castle of a king.

476
00:32:19,561 --> 00:32:22,029
Yeah, we've come
a long way.

477
00:32:23,097 --> 00:32:25,365
We're all
the same, really.

478
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,335
She went to great pains
to point that out to me.

479
00:32:28,369 --> 00:32:30,671
If you mistrust
fancy people so much,

480
00:32:30,705 --> 00:32:33,841
why were you in such a
hurry to trust her?

481
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:37,611
You're me.

482
00:32:37,646 --> 00:32:39,079
Never been with a woman.

483
00:32:39,114 --> 00:32:41,849
<i>Never talked</i>
<i>to a woman, really.</i>

484
00:32:41,883 --> 00:32:43,450
<i>And then she</i>
<i>comes at you--</i>

485
00:32:43,484 --> 00:32:46,586
big words, no clothes.

486
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,388
What would you have done?

487
00:32:50,057 --> 00:32:53,692
She does know her way around a
man's head, I'll give her that.

488
00:32:59,331 --> 00:33:02,100
So how'd you
become a lord?

489
00:33:02,134 --> 00:33:03,734
Oh, that's a long story.

490
00:33:03,769 --> 00:33:06,870
Better not, then.
I'm a bit busy.

491
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:12,042
Many years ago
I helped King Stannis

492
00:33:12,076 --> 00:33:14,578
out of a difficult
situation.

493
00:33:14,612 --> 00:33:17,914
He rewarded me
with a lordship.

494
00:33:17,949 --> 00:33:20,217
And this.

495
00:33:21,986 --> 00:33:24,320
You see?

496
00:33:24,355 --> 00:33:26,522
Highborns.

497
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,595
I didn't want
to be a lord.

498
00:33:32,629 --> 00:33:34,430
I nearly didn't accept.

499
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,898
Why did you?

500
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:38,901
I did it for my son.

501
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:41,369
I didn't want him to step
over a river of shit

502
00:33:41,404 --> 00:33:43,904
every time he stepped
through his front door.

503
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,641
I wanted him to have
a better life.

504
00:33:49,644 --> 00:33:51,211
Does he?

505
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,181
He's dead.

506
00:33:59,786 --> 00:34:01,220
How'd he die?

507
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:04,589
Following me.

508
00:34:15,431 --> 00:34:18,866
When did you come
to this strange country?

509
00:34:20,635 --> 00:34:22,103
When I was 13.

510
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:24,071
You were only a child.

511
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,674
I stopped being a child
when I was nine.

512
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:30,443
My mother
made sure of that.

513
00:34:32,212 --> 00:34:33,980
You've been
a good influence

514
00:34:34,014 --> 00:34:36,315
on our mutual friend,
you know.

515
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,384
He used to drink
from sundown to sunup,

516
00:34:38,418 --> 00:34:40,018
visit three brothels
a night,

517
00:34:40,053 --> 00:34:42,587
gamble away
his father's money.

518
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,589
Now it's just
the drinking.

519
00:34:44,623 --> 00:34:47,959
And now
I'm his wife's servant.

520
00:34:47,993 --> 00:34:49,927
I brush her hair
and clip her nails

521
00:34:49,961 --> 00:34:51,428
and empty
her chamber pot.

522
00:34:51,463 --> 00:34:52,930
She is a sweet
young thing.

523
00:34:52,964 --> 00:34:54,431
None of this
is her fault.

524
00:34:54,465 --> 00:34:57,400
I love that girl.
I would kill for her.

525
00:34:57,434 --> 00:34:59,368
Do you think that
makes it easier for me?

526
00:34:59,403 --> 00:35:02,471
No, I expect not.

527
00:35:04,808 --> 00:35:08,277
She's young and she's
beautiful and highborn.

528
00:35:08,311 --> 00:35:10,078
We break bread
with them,

529
00:35:10,113 --> 00:35:12,714
but that doesn't
make us family.

530
00:35:12,749 --> 00:35:14,183
We've learned
their language,

531
00:35:14,217 --> 00:35:16,752
but we'll never be
their countrymen.

532
00:35:18,554 --> 00:35:21,489
If you let yourself believe

533
00:35:21,524 --> 00:35:23,725
that a foreign girl
with no name

534
00:35:23,759 --> 00:35:26,093
could spend her life with
the son of Tywin Lannister--

535
00:35:26,128 --> 00:35:28,896
- I have a name.
- You have one name.

536
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,464
As do I.

537
00:35:30,498 --> 00:35:33,500
Here only the family
name matters.

538
00:35:33,535 --> 00:35:35,769
What do you want
from me, Lord Varys?

539
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,175
Diamonds.

540
00:35:41,209 --> 00:35:44,144
I'd tell you to beware
carrying so much wealth,

541
00:35:44,178 --> 00:35:46,546
but you know how
to protect yourself.

542
00:35:47,515 --> 00:35:49,215
Get on one
of those ships.

543
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,018
Sail to Pentos
or Lys or Myr.

544
00:35:52,052 --> 00:35:55,188
You can buy a house
with these diamonds,

545
00:35:55,222 --> 00:35:57,190
a very large house.

546
00:35:57,224 --> 00:35:59,058
Hire servants.

547
00:35:59,093 --> 00:36:00,493
Start a new life,

548
00:36:00,527 --> 00:36:03,029
a good life,
far from here.

549
00:36:03,063 --> 00:36:06,131
The mysterious
foreign beauty.

550
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:08,167
You'll have suitors
lining up.

551
00:36:08,201 --> 00:36:10,468
Why do you
want me to leave?

552
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:13,104
Tyrion Lannister is one
of the few people alive

553
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:15,206
who could make this country
a better place.

554
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,941
He has the mind for it,
he has the will,

555
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:18,408
he has the right
last name.

556
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:20,543
And you--

557
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:23,713
you are a complication.

558
00:36:24,881 --> 00:36:27,148
I know you love him.

559
00:36:27,216 --> 00:36:31,118
And I know it's true love not
bought by gold and silver.

560
00:36:31,152 --> 00:36:33,687
I'm not asking you
to leave him for money.

561
00:36:33,721 --> 00:36:36,289
I'm asking you to leave

562
00:36:36,323 --> 00:36:39,325
because your presence
in the capital

563
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,727
endangers him.

564
00:36:42,896 --> 00:36:45,363
This will never
be your home, my lady.

565
00:36:45,398 --> 00:36:49,233
Find a true home
somewhere far from here...

566
00:36:50,569 --> 00:36:52,769
while there's still time.

567
00:36:53,938 --> 00:36:56,573
Lord Varys.

568
00:36:59,877 --> 00:37:03,545
If he wants me to leave,
he can tell me himself.

569
00:37:12,052 --> 00:37:13,552
Keep up.

570
00:37:13,586 --> 00:37:16,254
I don't think
I can, my lord.

571
00:37:18,256 --> 00:37:20,757
It's not easy
being drunk all the time.

572
00:37:21,926 --> 00:37:25,228
Everyone would do it
if it were easy.

573
00:37:27,697 --> 00:37:29,698
Leave.

574
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:42,342
So, enjoying
married life?

575
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:49,848
An unhappy wife is a wine
merchant's best friend.

576
00:37:49,882 --> 00:37:52,249
She doesn't
deserve this.

577
00:37:52,284 --> 00:37:53,784
Deserve?

578
00:37:53,818 --> 00:37:56,720
Be careful with that.

579
00:37:56,754 --> 00:37:59,956
Start trying to work out
who deserves what

580
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:02,391
and before long you'll spend
the rest of your days

581
00:38:02,425 --> 00:38:05,661
weeping for each and every
person in the world.

582
00:38:05,695 --> 00:38:09,297
There's nothing worse
than a late-blooming philosopher.

583
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:12,967
Will you be facing
your marriage to Ser Loras

584
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:16,136
with the same
philosophical spirit?

585
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:17,738
I won't be marrying
Ser Loras.

586
00:38:17,772 --> 00:38:20,607
I seem to remember
saying something similar

587
00:38:20,641 --> 00:38:22,608
about my own marriage.

588
00:38:22,643 --> 00:38:24,911
You're not me.

589
00:38:26,146 --> 00:38:28,046
You want to make things
better for Sansa?

590
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:29,815
Give her a child.

591
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,816
So you can tell Father
it was you

592
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,051
who finally
talked me into it?

593
00:38:34,086 --> 00:38:37,187
So she can have
some happiness in her life.

594
00:38:37,222 --> 00:38:38,923
You have children.

595
00:38:38,957 --> 00:38:42,059
How happy would
you say you are?

596
00:38:44,896 --> 00:38:46,663
Not very.

597
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,568
But if it weren't
for my children,

598
00:38:51,603 --> 00:38:54,471
I'd have thrown myself from the
highest window in the Red Keep.

599
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,875
They're the reason
I'm alive.

600
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:00,977
Even Joffrey?

601
00:39:02,011 --> 00:39:03,879
Even Joffrey.

602
00:39:07,516 --> 00:39:09,983
He was all I had once.

603
00:39:10,018 --> 00:39:12,652
Before Myrcella was born.

604
00:39:16,156 --> 00:39:18,758
I used to spend hours

605
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:21,226
looking at him.

606
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,361
His wisps of hair.

607
00:39:24,463 --> 00:39:27,130
His tiny little
hands and feet.

608
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,701
He was such
a jolly little fellow.

609
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,939
You always hear the terrible
ones were terrible babies.

610
00:39:36,973 --> 00:39:39,741
"We should have known.
Even then we should have known."

611
00:39:39,775 --> 00:39:41,875
It's nonsense.

612
00:39:43,645 --> 00:39:46,213
Whenever he was with me,
he was happy.

613
00:39:50,184 --> 00:39:51,885
And no one can take that
away from me,

614
00:39:51,919 --> 00:39:53,686
not even Joffrey--

615
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,321
how it feels
to have someone.

616
00:39:57,323 --> 00:39:59,824
Someone of your own.

617
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,167
How long
does it go on?

618
00:40:14,637 --> 00:40:17,239
Until we've dealt
with all our enemies.

619
00:40:18,808 --> 00:40:21,542
Every time we deal
with an enemy,

620
00:40:21,576 --> 00:40:23,644
we create two more.

621
00:40:25,213 --> 00:40:28,548
Then I suppose it will go
on for quite a long time.

622
00:40:33,419 --> 00:40:35,920
I'm telling you,
that's what she did.

623
00:40:38,289 --> 00:40:41,223
<i>Sounded like</i>
<i>a cow in heat.</i>

624
00:40:41,258 --> 00:40:43,692
- Aye, not for long.
- That's right.

625
00:40:43,727 --> 00:40:45,894
Black Walder
shut her up right quick.

626
00:40:45,929 --> 00:40:49,130
<i>None of the Starks had much to
say about the end of that meal.</i>

627
00:40:49,164 --> 00:40:50,698
I'll tell you what,
though.

628
00:40:50,732 --> 00:40:54,034
The hardest thing was getting that
wolf's head to stay on the body.

629
00:40:54,068 --> 00:40:56,570
- You sewed it on?
- I did.

630
00:40:56,604 --> 00:40:59,706
I bet there were 1,000 men
claiming they were the one.

631
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,474
It was me.

632
00:41:01,508 --> 00:41:04,444
And Malcolm
and Talbott.

633
00:41:04,478 --> 00:41:07,213
Well, the thing was so heavy,
it fell off the first time.

634
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:08,814
Took the skin
right with it.

635
00:41:08,848 --> 00:41:11,817
<i>What we ended up having to do</i>
<i>was hook the needle</i>

636
00:41:11,852 --> 00:41:13,419
<i>right under</i>
<i>the collarbone.</i>

637
00:41:13,453 --> 00:41:16,255
Give it a nice
firm mooring and--

638
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:20,858
What do you want?

639
00:41:20,893 --> 00:41:24,161
- Mind if I keep warm?
- Fuck off.

640
00:41:24,195 --> 00:41:26,529
But I'm hungry.

641
00:41:26,564 --> 00:41:29,965
Does fuck off mean something
different where you're from?

642
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,133
I've got money.

643
00:41:36,404 --> 00:41:38,204
What kind of coin
is that?

644
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:40,073
It's worth a lot.

645
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,010
Sorry.

646
00:41:44,045 --> 00:41:46,045
Little shit.

647
00:41:50,751 --> 00:41:52,485
<i>Fool!</i>

648
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,935
Where did you
get the knife?

649
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:11,670
From you.

650
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,675
<i>Is that the first man</i>
<i>you've killed?</i>

651
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:19,810
The first man.

652
00:42:21,078 --> 00:42:23,446
Next time you're going
to do something like that,

653
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,614
tell me first.

654
00:42:37,224 --> 00:42:39,658
Valar morghulis.

655
00:43:08,785 --> 00:43:11,487
Ygritte, you know
I didn't have a choice.

656
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:17,492
You always knew who I was,

657
00:43:17,526 --> 00:43:19,360
what I am.

658
00:43:21,897 --> 00:43:24,565
I have to go home now.

659
00:43:26,668 --> 00:43:29,068
I know you won't hurt me.

660
00:43:30,604 --> 00:43:32,672
You know nothing,
Jon Snow.

661
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:38,777
I do know some things.

662
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,614
I know I love you.

663
00:43:44,283 --> 00:43:46,617
<i>I know you love me.</i>

664
00:43:49,254 --> 00:43:52,090
But I have
to go home now.

665
00:44:32,729 --> 00:44:35,197
I know how
this must look.

666
00:44:37,768 --> 00:44:41,036
- What I meant was--
- I swear to you, my lord--

667
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:43,505
I'm not a lord, my dear.

668
00:44:43,539 --> 00:44:46,241
Not for many, many years.

669
00:44:46,275 --> 00:44:49,611
<i>Every man who joins</i>
<i>the Night's Watch</i>

670
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:53,714
renounces
all former titles.

671
00:44:55,383 --> 00:44:57,617
Among other things.

672
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,422
What is your name?

673
00:45:02,456 --> 00:45:04,123
Gilly.

674
00:45:04,158 --> 00:45:07,460
Ah, for the gillyflower.

675
00:45:07,494 --> 00:45:08,994
Lovely.

676
00:45:09,028 --> 00:45:11,362
Yes, my--

677
00:45:13,432 --> 00:45:15,066
Maester.

678
00:45:16,001 --> 00:45:17,302
Master.

679
00:45:17,336 --> 00:45:19,804
Maester.

680
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:21,806
And the child?

681
00:45:23,242 --> 00:45:25,443
She hasn't chosen
a name yet.

682
00:45:25,477 --> 00:45:27,778
His name is Sam.

683
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:33,484
Tarly...

684
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:36,920
do you remember
the oath you swore

685
00:45:36,955 --> 00:45:39,522
when you joined
this order?

686
00:45:39,557 --> 00:45:42,692
He's not my child,
Maester Aemon.

687
00:45:44,028 --> 00:45:45,928
She's one
of Craster's wives.

688
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:54,302
I remember every word
of the oath.

689
00:45:55,404 --> 00:45:58,039
Night gathers
and my watch begins.

690
00:45:58,074 --> 00:46:01,909
<i>I am the shield that guards</i>
<i>the realms of men.</i>

691
00:46:03,979 --> 00:46:06,580
The realms of men.

692
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:11,318
That means her
as well as us.

693
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:14,721
We didn't build
500 miles of ice walls

694
00:46:14,755 --> 00:46:17,390
700 feet high
to keep out men.

695
00:46:19,493 --> 00:46:21,728
The night is gathering,
Maester Aemon.

696
00:46:21,762 --> 00:46:23,830
I've seen it.

697
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,365
It's coming
for all of us.

698
00:46:28,969 --> 00:46:32,237
Gilly, you and your son

699
00:46:32,272 --> 00:46:35,240
will be our guests
for the time being.

700
00:46:35,274 --> 00:46:40,177
We certainly cannot
send you back

701
00:46:40,211 --> 00:46:42,178
beyond the Wall.

702
00:46:42,213 --> 00:46:44,714
Thank you...

703
00:46:44,748 --> 00:46:47,116
Maester.

704
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:49,218
I can cook and clean
and I can--

705
00:46:49,252 --> 00:46:50,919
Good.

706
00:46:50,954 --> 00:46:55,489
Samwell, fetch a quill
and inkwell.

707
00:46:59,594 --> 00:47:03,196
I hope your penmanship is
better than your swordplay.

708
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:05,331
Miles better.

709
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,902
We had 44 ravens
at last count.

710
00:47:10,937 --> 00:47:14,405
Make sure
they're all fed.

711
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,708
Every one of them
flies tonight.

712
00:47:26,717 --> 00:47:29,184
"To His Grace

713
00:47:29,219 --> 00:47:31,887
King Stannis Baratheon.

714
00:47:32,955 --> 00:47:36,324
Invaded-- inv--
invit-- invited

715
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:40,127
to the name day
celebration

716
00:47:40,161 --> 00:47:45,465
for Rylene Florent

717
00:47:45,499 --> 00:47:47,733
on the first nigit--"

718
00:47:47,768 --> 00:47:49,735
Night.

719
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:52,037
"First night
of the full moon."

720
00:47:52,071 --> 00:47:53,505
Why is there
a G in night?

721
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:55,573
I don't know.
There just is.

722
00:47:56,775 --> 00:47:58,843
Well, your father's
not going to go to that.

723
00:48:00,278 --> 00:48:02,779
My books are better
than these boring scrolls.

724
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:04,814
You could read about
Balerion the Dread.

725
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:08,350
They say you can still see his skull
in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep.

726
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,685
I'd like to see
that someday.

727
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:14,088
I've been trying to stay out of
those dungeons my whole life.

728
00:48:14,122 --> 00:48:17,691
"His fangs were as long
as bastard swords."

729
00:48:19,027 --> 00:48:21,061
Aye, old Balerion's
definitely better

730
00:48:21,095 --> 00:48:24,230
than anything your cousin
Rylene's got on offer.

731
00:48:24,264 --> 00:48:26,632
But now that I'm your
father's Hand again,

732
00:48:26,666 --> 00:48:28,933
I have to keep
him informed.

733
00:48:30,168 --> 00:48:32,502
The king does not have
time for this drudgery.

734
00:48:34,371 --> 00:48:38,507
"To all the lords
and knobble men of Westeros."

735
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:41,376
- Noblemen.
- <i>"Noblemen of Westeros,</i>

736
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:45,847
the Nig--
the Night's Watch...

737
00:48:48,917 --> 00:48:50,985
implores..."

738
00:48:51,019 --> 00:48:52,653
What is it?

739
00:48:57,058 --> 00:48:58,958
Why are they
ringing the bells?

740
00:48:58,993 --> 00:49:00,860
<i>Are we being attacked?</i>

741
00:49:00,894 --> 00:49:03,328
Stay here.

742
00:49:03,363 --> 00:49:05,463
Bar the door.

743
00:49:23,879 --> 00:49:26,247
The usurper
Robb Stark is dead.

744
00:49:26,281 --> 00:49:29,716
Betrayed by his bannerman.

745
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:33,553
And you take credit because you
dropped a leech into the fire?

746
00:49:33,587 --> 00:49:35,154
I take no credit.

747
00:49:35,189 --> 00:49:38,224
<i>I have faith and my faith</i>
<i>has been rewarded.</i>

748
00:49:41,427 --> 00:49:45,730
Your Grace, the world
has got so far bent.

749
00:49:45,764 --> 00:49:48,632
I've seen things
crawl out of nightmares,

750
00:49:48,666 --> 00:49:50,366
but my eyes were open.

751
00:49:50,401 --> 00:49:53,235
I don't know if Robb Stark died
because of the Red Woman's sorcery

752
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:55,470
or because at war
men die all the time,

753
00:49:55,504 --> 00:49:58,672
but I do know that uniting
the Seven Kingdoms

754
00:49:58,707 --> 00:50:00,374
with blood magic is wrong.

755
00:50:00,408 --> 00:50:01,575
It is evil.

756
00:50:01,609 --> 00:50:03,777
And you are not
an evil man.

757
00:50:03,811 --> 00:50:06,513
Do you know who had this table
carved and painted, Ser Davos?

758
00:50:07,448 --> 00:50:08,815
Aegon Targaryen.

759
00:50:08,849 --> 00:50:11,484
And do you know how Aegon
Targaryen conquered Westeros?

760
00:50:11,518 --> 00:50:13,552
On the back of his dragon
Balerion the Dread.

761
00:50:13,586 --> 00:50:17,421
He had a smaller fleet
than the kings he faced

762
00:50:17,455 --> 00:50:20,157
and a smaller army,
but he had three dragons.

763
00:50:20,224 --> 00:50:22,292
Dragons are magic,
Ser Davos.

764
00:50:22,327 --> 00:50:25,762
My enemies have made
my kingdom bleed.

765
00:50:27,698 --> 00:50:29,732
<i>I will not forget that.</i>

766
00:50:29,767 --> 00:50:32,402
I will not forgive that.

767
00:50:33,938 --> 00:50:36,739
I will punish them
with any arms

768
00:50:36,773 --> 00:50:38,074
at my disposal.

769
00:50:38,108 --> 00:50:40,977
You do not need
to burn the boy.

770
00:50:41,011 --> 00:50:44,246
<i>If what you say is true,</i>

771
00:50:44,281 --> 00:50:47,350
a drop of his blood
killed Robb Stark--

772
00:50:47,384 --> 00:50:50,152
And our king is still
no closer to the Iron Throne.

773
00:50:52,889 --> 00:50:56,258
A great gift requires
a great sacrifice.

774
00:51:12,907 --> 00:51:15,275
His name is Gendry.

775
00:51:15,309 --> 00:51:16,943
He's a good lad.

776
00:51:18,078 --> 00:51:20,146
A poor lad
from Flea Bottom

777
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,848
who happens
to be your nephew.

778
00:51:27,953 --> 00:51:31,656
What is the life of one bastard
boy against a kingdom?

779
00:51:33,425 --> 00:51:35,192
Everything.

780
00:51:36,127 --> 00:51:38,328
The boy must die.

781
00:51:45,668 --> 00:51:47,635
- What are you doing?
- You're leaving.

782
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:50,504
Is this some kind
of trick?

783
00:51:50,572 --> 00:51:53,206
Yes, but not on you.

784
00:51:57,143 --> 00:52:00,078
Aim for that star.
Don't stop.

785
00:52:00,112 --> 00:52:02,347
There's bread and water.
Go slow with it.

786
00:52:02,381 --> 00:52:04,115
If you finish it off,

787
00:52:04,149 --> 00:52:07,418
no matter how
thirsty you get,

788
00:52:07,452 --> 00:52:09,386
don't drink seawater.

789
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,421
I know not
to drink seawater.

790
00:52:11,455 --> 00:52:15,125
Row for a full day and night
and you'll reach Rook's Rest.

791
00:52:15,159 --> 00:52:17,894
You'll want to stop there.
Don't. She'll find you.

792
00:52:17,928 --> 00:52:19,262
Where should I go?

793
00:52:19,296 --> 00:52:20,697
You must keep the coast
on your left side

794
00:52:20,731 --> 00:52:22,264
until you reach
King's Landing.

795
00:52:22,299 --> 00:52:24,166
The gold cloaks
are looking for me.

796
00:52:24,201 --> 00:52:25,901
They were looking
for me for 20 years.

797
00:52:25,935 --> 00:52:27,902
- Do they know your face?
- No.

798
00:52:27,937 --> 00:52:29,671
I'd worry more
about the Red Woman.

799
00:52:36,712 --> 00:52:38,345
The other way.

800
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:44,717
You ever been
in a boat before?

801
00:52:44,751 --> 00:52:46,352
No.

802
00:52:46,386 --> 00:52:47,653
You know how to swim?

803
00:52:47,687 --> 00:52:48,887
No.

804
00:52:48,955 --> 00:52:50,355
Don't fall out.

805
00:52:50,389 --> 00:52:52,891
Go on.

806
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,227
Why are you doing this?

807
00:52:56,262 --> 00:52:58,729
<i>Because it's right.</i>

808
00:52:58,764 --> 00:53:00,631
And because
I'm a slow learner.

809
00:53:03,301 --> 00:53:06,837
When you get to Flea Bottom,
have a bowl of brown for me.

810
00:53:11,576 --> 00:53:13,343
<i>Horse approaching!</i>

811
00:53:13,378 --> 00:53:16,546
Halt! Halt!

812
00:53:34,362 --> 00:53:36,163
Jon! Jon!

813
00:53:36,197 --> 00:53:37,864
<i>Jon, it's us.</i>

814
00:53:37,899 --> 00:53:40,200
I don't think
he can see us.

815
00:53:44,004 --> 00:53:47,206
Pyp?

816
00:53:47,241 --> 00:53:49,475
Sam?

817
00:53:49,509 --> 00:53:52,845
Hush, now.
You're home.

818
00:53:54,514 --> 00:53:57,549
Carry him inside.
Gently.

819
00:54:22,872 --> 00:54:25,206
Out of the way.

820
00:54:25,241 --> 00:54:26,875
Step aside,
country boy.

821
00:54:26,909 --> 00:54:28,777
People working here.

822
00:55:13,846 --> 00:55:15,980
Cersei.

823
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:36,664
You don't deny it?

824
00:55:36,698 --> 00:55:38,699
No.

825
00:55:39,768 --> 00:55:41,835
I let him go.

826
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:44,938
Your mercy
saved the boy's life.

827
00:55:44,972 --> 00:55:46,773
You feel good
about that?

828
00:55:46,807 --> 00:55:48,174
Aye, I do.

829
00:55:48,208 --> 00:55:50,776
<i>You saved one innocent.</i>

830
00:55:50,844 --> 00:55:54,479
How many tens of thousands
have you doomed?

831
00:55:57,650 --> 00:56:00,084
There has got
to be another way.

832
00:56:00,118 --> 00:56:01,552
What other way?!

833
00:56:01,586 --> 00:56:03,387
Tell us about
this other way.

834
00:56:03,421 --> 00:56:05,089
I don't know,
Your Grace.

835
00:56:05,123 --> 00:56:07,891
I can't see the future
in the fire.

836
00:56:12,162 --> 00:56:14,229
Very well,
Ser Davos Seaworth.

837
00:56:15,498 --> 00:56:18,166
I, Stannis
of the House Baratheon,

838
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,535
First of My Name, Rightful King
of the Andals and the First Men,

839
00:56:20,569 --> 00:56:22,470
- sentence you to die.
- I understand.

840
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,772
But since you haven't yet
unnamed me Hand of the King,

841
00:56:24,806 --> 00:56:27,307
it is my duty
to advise you against it.

842
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,943
- You're gonna need me.
- Take him away.

843
00:56:31,379 --> 00:56:33,113
Why am I gonna need you?

844
00:56:37,451 --> 00:56:38,851
My king.

845
00:56:42,755 --> 00:56:45,289
<i>It's from Maester Aemon</i>
<i>of the Night's Watch.</i>

846
00:56:45,324 --> 00:56:46,958
<i>Their Lord Commander</i>
<i>is dead.</i>

847
00:56:46,992 --> 00:56:49,660
<i>Took a ranging party north</i>
<i>and never made it back.</i>

848
00:56:49,694 --> 00:56:51,895
One lad did, though.

849
00:56:51,929 --> 00:56:54,564
What he saw
beyond the Wall--

850
00:56:54,598 --> 00:56:57,033
it's coming
for all of us.

851
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:13,012
When did you
learn to read?

852
00:57:13,046 --> 00:57:14,513
Matthos taught me
before he died

853
00:57:14,547 --> 00:57:16,615
so I could be
of better service to you.

854
00:57:24,123 --> 00:57:27,625
This War of Five Kings
means nothing.

855
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:32,162
<i>The true war lies</i>
<i>to the north, my king.</i>

856
00:57:33,264 --> 00:57:35,598
Death marches on the Wall.

857
00:57:35,633 --> 00:57:38,234
Only you can stop him.

858
00:57:38,269 --> 00:57:40,336
You can't stop him alone.

859
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:43,071
You need someone to rebuild
your army for you,

860
00:57:43,106 --> 00:57:45,640
someone to convince this lord
and that lord to fight for you,

861
00:57:45,675 --> 00:57:47,742
to bring sellswords
and pirates to your side.

862
00:57:47,777 --> 00:57:50,145
I've made my decision.

863
00:57:51,547 --> 00:57:54,749
He's right.
You need him.

864
00:57:54,783 --> 00:57:57,419
He has a part to play
in the war to come.

865
00:58:06,393 --> 00:58:08,860
You see, Ser Davos?

866
00:58:08,895 --> 00:58:12,263
You've been saved
by that fire god you like to mock.

867
00:58:15,967 --> 00:58:18,034
You're in his army now.

868
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,422
They will come,
Your Grace.

869
00:58:43,456 --> 00:58:45,357
When they're ready.

870
00:58:45,392 --> 00:58:47,159
Perhaps they didn't
want to be conquered.

871
00:58:47,193 --> 00:58:49,695
You didn't conquer them.

872
00:58:49,729 --> 00:58:51,864
You liberated them.

873
00:58:52,999 --> 00:58:55,334
People learn to love
their chains.

874
00:59:57,089 --> 00:59:59,090
No.

875
01:00:37,025 --> 01:00:39,326
- Mhysa!
- Mhysa!

876
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:42,128
Mhysa! Mhysa!

877
01:00:42,163 --> 01:00:44,463
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

878
01:00:45,365 --> 01:00:47,433
What does it mean?

879
01:00:47,467 --> 01:00:50,368
It is old Ghiscari,
khaleesi.

880
01:00:50,403 --> 01:00:52,804
It means "mother."

881
01:00:58,108 --> 01:01:00,843
It's all right.

882
01:01:00,877 --> 01:01:02,578
These people
won't hurt me.

883
01:01:05,082 --> 01:01:07,750
Mhysa! Mhysa!

884
01:01:56,526 --> 01:01:59,694
Mhysa.

885
01:02:11,205 --> 01:02:13,806
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

886
