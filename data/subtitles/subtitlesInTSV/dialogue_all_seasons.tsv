1	 - Valar morghulis. - Valar dohaeris.	2	5	3
2	 I've been sweeping this floor for days.	3	5	3
3	 - Good. - I didn't come here to sweep floors.	3	5	3
4	 No? Why come than?	3	5	3
5	 You said that I could be your apprentice.	3	5	3
6	 You said you'd teach me how to a Faceless Man.	3	5	3
7	 A man teaches a girl.	3	5	3
8	 Valar dohaeris. All men must serve.	3	5	3
9	 Faceless men, most of all.	3	5	3
10	 I want to serve.	3	5	3
11	 A girl wants to serve herself.	4	5	3
12	 Here we serve the Many-Faced God, to serve well.	4	5	3
13	 - A girl must become no-one. - Which one is the Many-Faced God?	4	5	3
14	 I see the Stranger, I see the Drowned God,	4	5	3
15	 - I see the Weirwood Face. - There is only one god.	4	5	3
16	 A girl knows his name.	4	5	3
17	 And no man know his gift.	4	5	3
18	 Where are they taking him?	5	5	3
19	 Queen Margaery!	5	5	3
20	 Queen Margaery!	5	5	3
21	 Queen Margaery!	5	5	3
22	 - I'm his, and he's mine. - I'm hers, and she's mine.	5	5	3
23	 - From this day until the end of my days. - From this day until the end of my days.	5	5	3
24	 - Did I hurt you? - No. You were lovely.	6	5	3
25	 - It all happened so fast. - Yes.	6	5	3
26	 I was scared maybe I hurt you, it sounded like...	6	5	3
27	 No, no, no...	6	5	3
28	 you're very sweet.	6	5	3
29	 The sweetest king who ever lived.	6	5	3
30	 This is what I want to do all day, every day for the rest of my life.	6	5	3
31	 Wouldn't that be glorious?	6	5	3
32	 Shouldn't we rest a little while?	7	5	3
33	 Just to catch our breath, there's no rush, is there?	7	5	3
34	 Of course not.	7	5	3
35	 Are you hungry?	7	5	3
36	 Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice...?	7	5	3
37	 No, I'm fine...	7	5	3
38	 I just want you all to myself.	7	5	3
39	 I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name.	7	5	3
40	 King Tommen... it still sounds strange to me.	7	5	3
41	 Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?	7	5	3
42	 - So strange. Husband. - Wife.	7	5	3
43	 Sometimes it feels odd.	7	5	3
44	 I'm the king, I've married the most beautiful woman in the world,	7	5	3
45	 and it's all because my brother died.	7	5	3
46	 I understand.	7	5	3
47	 But it's no your fault, you know that, don't you?	7	5	3
48	 You mustn't feel guilty.	7	5	3
49	 I don't feel guilty. That's what's odd.	7	5	3
50	 Do you like to sail?	8	5	3
51	 - I love to sail. - I do, too.	8	5	3
52	 I think we're going to be very happy, you and I.	8	5	3
53	 I do, too.	8	5	3
54	 Living in a tower so high, it touches the clouds.	8	5	3
55	 Of course my grandmother couldn't wait to go home.	8	5	3
56	 The capital is not for everyone, I suppose.	8	5	3
57	 Does your mother like it here?	8	5	3
58	 I don't think so.	8	5	3
59	 She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.	8	5	3
60	 It's so wonderful to have her watching over you.	8	5	3
61	 A lioness guiding her cub.	8	5	3
62	 Well, but I'm a man now.	8	5	3
63	 You are.	8	5	3
64	 And the king.	8	5	3
65	 But you'll always be her baby-boy.	9	5	3
66	 I suppose.	9	5	3
67	 I adore how she has always been so generous with me, so kind.	9	5	3
68	 And the horror she's had to endure.	9	5	3
69	 Losing her husband, her eldest child and her father.	9	5	3
70	 It's no wonder she's so protective of you.	9	5	3
71	 She'll never let you out of her sight.	9	5	3
72	 You're very much in love.	9	5	3
73	 The first days of marriage are often so blissful.	9	5	3
74	 She's certainly very pretty, isn't she?	9	5	3
75	 Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot.	9	5	3
76	 Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell.	9	5	3
77	 - Not that it matters. - Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?	9	5	3
78	 There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.	9	5	3
79	 That's where you grew up.	9	5	3
80	 You always told me that you liked the people there better.	9	5	3
81	 You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk.	9	5	3
82	 - Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock? - The way that you talked about it...	10	5	3
83	 I always thought that you missed it.	10	5	3
84	 - That you... That it was your real home. - This is my real home now.	10	5	3
85	 Where my family lives.	10	5	3
86	 I want you to be happy, mother.	10	5	3
87	 I know that.	10	5	3
88	 - I know you do, my sweet boy. - But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock?	10	5	3
89	" I said, ""Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record?"""	10	5	3
90	" And he said, ""Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it."""	10	5	3
91	 Mother.	10	5	3
92	 Welcome.	10	5	3
93	 Well don't you look lovely.	10	5	3
94	 Marriage agrees with you.	10	5	3
95	 Can we bring you anything to eat or drink?	10	5	3
96	 I wish we had some wine for you. It's a bit early in the day for us.	10	5	3
97	 No, no, I...I can't stay.	11	5	3
98	 I just wanted to let you know if...	11	5	3
99	 there is ever anything I can do for you.	11	5	3
100	 You are very sweet.	11	5	3
101	 Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.	11	5	3
102	 I absolutely adore him.	11	5	3
103	 You raised a gallant young man.	11	5	3
104	 - I'm forever grateful. - Good.	11	5	3
105	 Good.	11	5	3
106	 I'm glad to hear you're happy.	11	5	3
107	 Ecstatic. I really am.	11	5	3
108	 Exhausted, to be honest, but	11	5	3
109	 what can I expect, he is half lion, half stag.	11	5	3
110	 I'll leave you to it then.	11	5	3
111	 Oh, forgive me, I haven't been at Court for long, I get so confused.	11	5	3
112	 What's the proper way to address you now?	11	5	3
113	 Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?	11	5	3
114	 There's no need for such formalities.	11	5	3
115	 In any event, judging from the King's enthusiasm,	11	5	3
116	 the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon.	11	5	3
117	 That'll be a lovely day.	11	5	3
118	 Imagine the celebrations.	11	5	3
119	 They'll ring the bells all day and night.	12	5	3
120	 Remember.	12	5	3
121	 Anything you need.	12	5	3
122	 We can't hold the North with terror alone.	13	5	3
123	 You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us.	13	5	3
124	 I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies.	13	5	3
125	 Lord Cerwyn refused to pay.	13	5	3
126	 He said the Warden of the North will always be a Stark,	13	5	3
127	 and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot.	13	5	3
128	 You left him no choice.	13	5	3
129	 I flayed him living,	13	5	3
130	 along with his wife and brother.	13	5	3
131	 I made his son watch.	13	5	3
132	 And?	13	5	3
133	 The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.	13	5	3
134	 I have something important to tell you.	14	5	3
135	 Stop eating and listen.	14	5	3
136	 We don't have enough men to hold the North	14	5	3
137	 if the other Houses rise up against us.	14	5	3
138	 Do you understand that?	14	5	3
139	 Our pact with the Lannisters...	14	5	3
140	 I had a pact with Tywin Lannister.	14	5	3
141	 Tywin Lannister is dead.	14	5	3
142	 The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact.	14	5	3
143	 They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms	14	5	3
144	 sent their army this far north.	14	5	3
145	 If you think they will for us, you're a fool.	14	5	3
146	 We become a great House by entering in alliances with other Houses,	14	5	3
147	 and parleying those alliances into greater power.	14	5	3
148	 Now the best way to forge a lasting alliance	14	5	3
149	 isn't by peeling a man's skin off,	14	5	3
150	 the best way is marriage.	14	5	3
151	 Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree,	14	5	3
152	 it's time you married a suitable bride.	14	5	3
153	 And as it happens,	15	5	3
154	 I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North.	15	5	3
155	 - That's Moat Cailin. - Yes.	15	5	3
156	 A bit shabby, isn't it?	15	5	3
157	 You've been here before.	15	5	3
158	 On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and...	15	5	3
159	 - Where are you taking me? - Home.	15	5	3
160	 The Boltons have Winterfell.	15	5	3
161	 The marriage proposal...It wasn't for you?	15	5	3
162	 No.	15	5	3
163	 Roose Bolton murdered my brother. He betrayed my family!	15	5	3
164	 He did.	16	5	3
165	 He serves the Lannisters.	16	5	3
166	 - For now. - I won't go.	16	5	3
167	 - Winterfell is your home. - Not anymore.	16	5	3
168	 Always. You're a Stark.	16	5	3
169	 Dyeing your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark.	16	5	3
170	 The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark.	16	5	3
171	 Your place is in the North.	16	5	3
172	 I can't marry him. You can't make me.	16	5	3
173	 He's a traitor. A murderer.	16	5	3
174	 You're not marrying Roose Bolton.	16	5	3
175	 No, you'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay.	16	5	3
176	 - One day he'll be Warden of the North and... - No!	16	5	3
177	 - Sansa... - No, you can't make me.	16	5	3
178	 I will starve myself. I will die before I have to go there.	16	5	3
179	 I won't force you to do anything.	16	5	3
180	 Don't you know by now how much I care for you?	16	5	3
181	 Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me.	16	5	3
182	 Listen.	16	5	3
183	 You've been running all your life.	16	5	3
184	 Terrible things happened to your family and you weep.	16	5	3
185	 You sit alone in a dark room, mourning their fates.	16	5	3
186	 You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father.	17	5	3
187	 Stop being a bystander, you hear me? Stop running.	17	5	3
188	 There's no justice in the world.	17	5	3
189	 Not unless we make it.	17	5	3
190	 You loved your family.	17	5	3
191	 Avenge them.	17	5	3
192	 How do we get through there?	18	5	3
193	 We don't.	18	5	3
194	 We go around.	18	5	3
195	 It sets miles out of the way.	18	5	3
196	 - We'll lose sight of them. - Doesn't matter.	18	5	3
197	 I know where they're going.	18	5	3
198	 Don't you get a bit old for a squire?	18	5	3
199	 How did you end up squiring for the Imp?	18	5	3
200	 He hates that nickname.	18	5	3
201	 Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?	18	5	3
202	 I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings.	19	5	3
203	 One night,	19	5	3
204	 he had a bit too much to drink.	19	5	3
205	 And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham.	19	5	3
206	 - He borrowed it? - He wasn't a thief.	19	5	3
207	 He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking.	19	5	3
208	 I was drunk too.	19	5	3
209	 He gave me half the ham.	19	5	3
210	 Next morning,	19	5	3
211	 one of the guards saw him passed out,	19	5	3
212	 under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand.	19	5	3
213	 They hanged the man after noon.	19	5	3
214	 They tied the noose for me too,	19	5	3
215	 but Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne,	19	5	3
216	 so he pardoned me,	19	5	3
217	 and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son.	19	5	3
218	 Punishment?	19	5	3
219	 - For both of you. - It didn't seem that way.	19	5	3
220	 Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.	19	5	3
221	 I guess all of your lords were very kind to you.	19	5	3
222	 All except me.	19	5	3
223	 Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person.	19	5	3
224	 I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen.	19	5	3
225	 You beat The Hound.	19	5	3
226	 I'm proud to be your squire.	20	5	3
227	 I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.	20	5	3
228	 If you wouldn't snap at me I wouldn't learn anything.	20	5	3
229	 You want to be a knight, Pod?	20	5	3
230	 Yes.	20	5	3
231	 Starting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day,	20	5	3
232	 before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening.	20	5	3
233	 And I'm going to show you how to ride properly.	20	5	3
234	 Thank you.	20	5	3
235	 I can't knight you,	20	5	3
236	 but I can teach you how to fight.	20	5	3
237	 I suppose that's more important.	20	5	3
238	 You weren't a knight, but	20	5	3
239	 you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?	20	5	3
240	 I was.	20	5	3
241	 Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.	20	5	3
242	 He was.	20	5	3
243	 But how did you end up serving Renly?	21	5	3
244	 When I was a girl, my father held a ball.	21	5	3
245	 I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me.	21	5	3
246	 He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth.	21	5	3
247	 I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom.	21	5	3
248	 And it was wonderful.	21	5	3
249	 None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was.	21	5	3
250	 The shaft each other and threatened to duel	21	5	3
251	 if they thought it was their turn to dance.	21	5	3
252	 Whispered in my ear	21	5	3
253	 how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles.	21	5	3
254	 My father smiled at me and I smiled at him.	21	5	3
255	 I'd never been so happy.	21	5	3
256	 Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering.	21	5	3
257	 And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer.	22	5	3
258	 They were toying with me.	22	5	3
259	 Brienne the Beauty, they called me. Great joke.	22	5	3
260	 And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive.	22	5	3
261	 A great lumbering beast.	22	5	3
262	 I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms.	22	5	3
263	 Don't let them see your tears, he told me.	22	5	3
264	 The nasty little shits,	22	5	3
265	 nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.	22	5	3
266	 He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word.	22	5	3
267	 And he was the king's brother after all.	22	5	3
268	 But...wasn't he...	22	5	3
269	 Lord Tyrion said he was...	22	5	3
270	 Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot.	22	5	3
271	 He didn't love me, he didn't want me,	23	5	3
272	 he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt.	23	5	3
273	 He saved me from being a joke.	23	5	3
274	 From that day	23	5	3
275	 until his last day.	23	5	3
276	 And I couldn't save him in return.	23	5	3
277	 Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love.	23	5	3
278	 One day, I will avenge King Renly.	23	5	3
279	 But you said a shadow murdered him.	23	5	3
280	 How do you fight a shadow?	23	5	3
281	 A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon.	23	5	3
282	 I know it was Stannis.	23	5	3
283	 I know it in my heart.	23	5	3
284	 Stannis is a man, not a shadow.	23	5	3
285	 And a man...	23	5	3
286	 can be killed.	23	5	3
287	 - Lord Commander. - Your Grace.	23	5	3
288	 I'd like to speak alone.	23	5	3
289	 Ollie is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's.	24	5	3
290	 I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience.	24	5	3
291	 One day, he might command.	24	5	3
292	 Very well. Have you considered my offer?	24	5	3
293	 I have.	24	5	3
294	 And I thank you for it. You do me great honor.	24	5	3
295	 All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.	24	5	3
296	 Say the word and you will be.	24	5	3
297	 But I have to refuse you.	24	5	3
298	 I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.	24	5	3
299	 My place is here.	24	5	3
300	 I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family.	24	5	3
301	 Take back the castle where you grew up.	24	5	3
302	 To rule the North.	24	5	3
303	 I wish I could fight beside you.	24	5	3
304	 Believe me, I do.	24	5	3
305	 But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood.	24	5	3
306	 I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.	24	5	3
307	 You're as stubborn as your father.	25	5	3
308	 And as honorable.	25	5	3
309	 I can imagine no higher praise.	25	5	3
310	 I didn't mean it as praise.	25	5	3
311	 Honor got your father killed.	25	5	3
312	 But if your mind is made up, I won't try to persuade you.	25	5	3
313	 Can I ask Your Grace	25	5	3
314	 how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?	25	5	3
315	 Are you bored of us already?	25	5	3
316	 You saved us from Mance Rayder's army.	25	5	3
317	 We will never forget that.	25	5	3
318	 But it's a question of survival.	25	5	3
319	 Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely.	25	5	3
320	 Mm, winter is coming.	25	5	3
321	 I know it.	25	5	3
322	 We march on Winterfell within a fortnight.	25	5	3
323	 Before the snows trap us here.	25	5	3
324	 And the wildlings?	25	5	3
325	 They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it.	25	5	3
326	 I leave their fate to you.	25	5	3
327	 You could execute them, that's the safest course.	25	5	3
328	 Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing	25	5	3
329	 to compromise than Mance ever was.	25	5	3
330	 I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead.	26	5	3
331	 Most of the brothers, yes.	26	5	3
332	 There's little love for the free folk here.	26	5	3
333	 You're Lord Commander.	26	5	3
334	 Your decision.	26	5	3
335	 You have many enemies in Castle Black.	26	5	3
336	 Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere?	26	5	3
337	 Give him command of Eastwach-by-the-Sea.	26	5	3
338	 I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.	26	5	3
339	 Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.	26	5	3
340	 He sees something in you.	26	5	3
341	 Might not be apparent from his tone,	26	5	3
342	 but it's the truth. He believes in you.	26	5	3
343	 I'm sorry I disappointed him.	26	5	3
344	 The king is a complicated man.	26	5	3
345	 But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.	26	5	3
346	 As long as he's ruling them.	26	5	3
347	 He's the one true king.	26	5	3
348	 He has the blood right to that throne.	27	5	3
349	 I sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.	27	5	3
350	 Have you now?	27	5	3
351	 How does the Night's Watch vow go again?	27	5	3
352	 I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.	27	5	3
353	 Night gathers and now my watch begins...	27	5	3
354	 Not that bit, the bit at the end.	27	5	3
355	 I'm the sword in the darkness,	27	5	3
356	 the watcher on the walls,	27	5	3
357	 the shield that guards the realm of men.	27	5	3
358	 - I pledge my life... - Okay, that's enough.	27	5	3
359	 Shield that guards the realm of men.	27	5	3
360	 That's what you swore to be.	27	5	3
361	 Now I'm not a learned man,	27	5	3
362	 the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting	27	5	3
363	 in a frozen castle at the edge of the world.	27	5	3
364	 It just might mean wading in the muck and getting your boots dirty	27	5	3
365	 and doing what needs to be done.	27	5	3
366	 And what needs to be done?	27	5	3
367	 As long as the Boltons rule the North,	27	5	3
368	 the North will suffer.	27	5	3
369	 Just one man's opinion.	27	5	3
370	 What do you want?	28	5	3
371	 Who are you?	28	5	3
372	 What?	28	5	3
373	 You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned,	28	5	3
374	 whose value you do not respect.	28	5	3
375	 Who are you?	28	5	3
376	 No one. Ou! Cunt!	28	5	3
377	 A lie, a sad little lie.	28	5	3
378	 - Who are you? - I told you, I'm no...	28	5	3
379	 Do that again and...	28	5	3
380	 Who are you?	28	5	3
381	 You're about to find out.	29	5	3
382	 What are you doing?	29	5	3
383	 We're only playing.	29	5	3
384	 The game of faces.	29	5	3
385	 That girl is not ready.	29	5	3
386	 Clearly not.	29	5	3
387	 I am ready.	29	5	3
388	 For what?	29	5	3
389	 For every you want	29	5	3
390	 to be a Faceless Man.	29	5	3
391	 To be no one.	29	5	3
392	 Whose sword is that?	29	5	3
393	 It belongs to Arya Stark.	29	5	3
394	 Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes,	29	5	3
395	 Arya Stark's stolen silver.	29	5	3
396	 A man wonders	29	5	3
397	 how is it that no one	29	5	3
398	 came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things?	29	5	3
399	 What do you do with them after you wash them?	33	5	3
400	 Open gates!	34	5	3
401	 Hold up!	34	5	3
402	 Lady Sansa, welcome.	34	5	3
403	 Lord Bolton.	35	5	3
404	 May I introduce my son, Ramsay Bolton?	35	5	3
405	 It's an honor to meet you.	35	5	3
406	 I'll bring you a bowl of hot water.	35	5	3
407	 You must want to wash.	35	5	3
408	 Thank you.	35	5	3
409	 Welcome home, Lady Stark.	35	5	3
410	 The North remembers.	35	5	3
411	 Sam.	35	5	3
412	 Maester Aemon?	36	5	3
413	 He apologizes for not being here.	36	5	3
414	 He's not feeling well.	36	5	3
415	 Take good care of him.	36	5	3
416	 I will drink it then.	36	5	3
417	 He'll lose.	36	5	3
418	 As you all know too well,	36	5	3
419	 it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit.	36	5	3
420	 First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint	36	5	3
421	 a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task.	36	5	3
422	 Brian.	36	5	3
423	 It seems like a good job for a ginger.	36	5	3
424	 Ser Alliser.	36	5	3
425	 You have more experience than any other ranger at Castle Black.	36	5	3
426	 You proved your valour many times over	36	5	3
427	 by defending the Wall from the wildling attack.	36	5	3
428	 I name you First Ranger.	37	5	3
429	 Lord Janos.	37	5	3
430	 I'm giving you command of Greyguard.	37	5	3
431	 Greyguard is a ruin.	37	5	3
432	 Yes, the fort is in a sorry state.	37	5	3
433	 Restore it as best you can.	37	5	3
434	 First Builder Yarwyck can spare...	37	5	3
435	 I was charged with the defense of King's Landing	37	5	3
436	 when you were soiling your swaddling clothes.	37	5	3
437	 Keep your ruin.	37	5	3
438	 Alright, alright.	37	5	3
439	 Enough of that.	37	5	3
440	 You mistake me, my Lord.	37	5	3
441	 That was a command, not an offer.	37	5	3
442	 Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells,	37	5	3
443	 and ride for Greyguard.	37	5	3
444	 I will not go meekly off to freeze and die.	37	5	3
445	 Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you.	37	5	3
446	 I will not have it.	37	5	3
447	 Did you hear me, boy?	37	5	3
448	 I will not have it!	37	5	3
449	 You refusing to obey my order?	38	5	3
450	 You can stick your order up your bastard arse.	38	5	3
451	 Take Lord Janos outside.	38	5	3
452	 Ollie, bring me my sword.	38	5	3
453	 You cannot do this!	38	5	3
454	 Get your hands off me!	38	5	3
455	 You're scum! All of you!	38	5	3
456	 The boy thinks he can frighten me?	38	5	3
457	 He's mistaken, yes, very mistaken.	39	5	3
458	 A disgrace!	39	5	3
459	 I have friends, important friends in the capital!	39	5	3
460	 You'll see!	39	5	3
461	 If you have any last words, my Lord...	39	5	3
462	 now is the time.	39	5	3
463	 I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander!	39	5	3
464	 We all serve you. I'm sorry. Not only for this, for all I've done and said.	39	5	3
465	 I was wrong!	40	5	3
466	 My Lord, please, mercy! Mercy!	40	5	3
467	 I'll go! I will!	40	5	3
468	 Please.	40	5	3
469	 I'm afraid.	40	5	3
470	 I've always been afraid.	40	5	3
471	 You have served us well, my son.	41	5	3
472	 Thank you, Father!	41	5	3
473	 Which of the Seven will you worship today?	41	5	3
474	 The Maiden...where is the Maiden?	41	5	3
475	 And the Stranger.	41	5	3
476	 - Two is extra, you realize... - Yes, yes.	41	5	3
477	 What are you doing?	41	5	3
478	 This establishment belong to Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't...	41	5	3
479	 You have profaned our Faith.	41	5	3
480	 The Faith of our fathers and forefathers.	41	5	3
481	 I am the High Septon of the...	41	5	3
482	 You are a sinner.	41	5	3
483	 And you shall be punished.	41	5	3
484	 Sinner! Sinner!	42	5	3
485	 Sinner! Repent!	42	5	3
486	 Sinner! Sinner!	42	5	3
487	 Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!	42	5	3
488	 Sinner! Shame on you! Sinner!	42	5	3
489	 Sinner!	42	5	3
490	 Your Grace, Grandmaester, Lord Tyrell...	42	5	3
491	 Uh, it doesn't matter.	42	5	3
492	 As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven	42	5	3
493	 I give voice to the will of the Gods	42	5	3
494	 and I am their foremost servant in this world.	42	5	3
495	 An insult to me is an insult to the Gods.	42	5	3
496	 An assault on my person	42	5	3
497	 is an assault on our very religion.	42	5	3
498	 You were assaulted?	42	5	3
499	 I was.	42	5	3
500	 By those fanatics who call themselves sparrows.	42	5	3
501	 And they humiliated me, they...	42	5	3
502	 they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones.	42	5	3
503	 I am lucky to be alive.	42	5	3
504	 I heard this all began in Littlefinger's brothel.	42	5	3
505	 High Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear.	43	5	3
506	 I tend to both the highest born and the lowliest amongst us.	43	5	3
507	 Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother.	43	5	3
508	 So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?	43	5	3
509	 A man's private affairs ought to stay private.	43	5	3
510	 What do you want from us, High Septon?	43	5	3
511	 Justice!	43	5	3
512	 I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals	43	5	3
513	 and throw them in the black cells.	43	5	3
514	 I ask that you execute their leader,	43	5	3
515	 the so-called High Sparrow.	43	5	3
516	 He's a threat to everything we hold sacred.	43	5	3
517	 - If he goes unpunished... - And where do I find this man?	43	5	3
518	 This High Sparrow?	43	5	3
519	 I don't think this is a good idea, Your Grace.	43	5	3
520	 Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people.	43	5	3
521	 Where can I find the High Sparrow?	43	5	3
522	 Seven blessings...	43	5	3
523	 Thank the Gods.	44	5	3
524	 Just a little more.	44	5	3
525	 Thank you for the soup.	44	5	3
526	 The young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?	44	5	3
527	 High Sparrow?	44	5	3
528	 Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?	44	5	3
529	 Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle.	44	5	3
530	 So, it's meant to...	44	5	3
531	 We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us.	44	5	3
532	 The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven	44	5	3
533	 doesn't sit well with some so they belittle me.	44	5	3
534	 - Seven blessings to you. - Seven blessings to you, my dear.	44	5	3
535	 It's only a name, quite an easy burden to wear.	44	5	3
536	 Far easier than hers.	44	5	3
537	 Why no shoes?	44	5	3
538	 Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more.	45	5	3
539	 We all do that.	45	5	3
540	 It stops us from forgetting who we really are.	45	5	3
541	 Is that why you came to King's Landing?	45	5	3
542	 To remind everyone?	45	5	3
543	 Everyone? I have a hard time reminding myself.	45	5	3
544	 Well, I tell them no one's special.	45	5	3
545	 They think I'm special for telling them so.	45	5	3
546	 Perhaps they're right.	45	5	3
547	 It would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it?	45	5	3
548	 The Gods sent you here to tempt me?	45	5	3
549	 I hope not.	45	5	3
550	 I'd assumed	45	5	3
551	 you'd only come here to arrest me.	45	5	3
552	 For that incident with the High Septon.	45	5	3
553	 An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative	45	5	3
554	 of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?	45	5	3
555	 Hypocrisy is a boil.	45	5	3
556	 Lancing a boil is never pleasant.	45	5	3
557	 Although, they could have been more careful with the blade.	45	5	3
558	 The High Septon came to speak to me today.	45	5	3
559	 He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you.	46	5	3
560	 I wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter.	46	5	3
561	 My thoughts on the matter align with your own.	46	5	3
562	 The High Septon's behaviour was corosive, as was his attitude.	46	5	3
563	 Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside.	46	5	3
564	 So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead.	46	5	3
565	 The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world.	46	5	3
566	 If one collapses, so does the other.	46	5	3
567	 You must do everything necessary	46	5	3
568	 to protect one another.	46	5	3
569	 Your Grace.	47	5	3
570	 Send a message to Littlefinger	47	5	3
571	 in the Eyrie or wherever he's slythering about.	47	5	3
572	 At once, Your Grace.	47	5	3
573	 - How's your work coming along? - Very well.	47	5	3
574	 - You've made progress? - More than I've expected.	47	5	3
575	 Still a way to go, but...	47	5	3
576	 Very good. I'll leave you to it then.	47	5	3
577	" Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word ""immediate""."	47	5	3
578	 Shh...	47	5	3
579	 Easy, friend.	47	5	3
580	 Come on, children.	47	5	3
581	 She really is lovely.	48	5	3
582	 I hope I can make her happy.	48	5	3
583	 I hope so too.	48	5	3
584	 I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together.	48	5	3
585	 She suffered enough.	48	5	3
586	 I'll never hurt her.	48	5	3
587	 You have my word.	48	5	3
588	 I've heard very little about you.	48	5	3
589	 Which makes you quite a rare thing, as lords go.	48	5	3
590	 I haven't been a lord very long.	48	5	3
591	 - I was a bastard. - And you're not anymore.	48	5	3
592	 Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.	48	5	3
593	 Yes, father. And thank you, Lord Baelish.	48	5	3
594	 I'm forever in your debt.	48	5	3
595	 He seems pleased.	49	5	3
596	 Shouldn't he be?	49	5	3
597	 I assure you she's still a virgin.	49	5	3
598	 Tyrion never consumated the marriage. By the law of the land, she's no man's wife.	49	5	3
599	 Inspect her, if you must.	49	5	3
600	 I leave that to the brothel keeper.	49	5	3
601	 It's her name I need, not her virtue.	49	5	3
602	 I have delivered everything I've promised.	49	5	3
603	 And you prepared for the consequences.	49	5	3
604	 When the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.	49	5	3
605	 The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did.	49	5	3
606	 Tywin is dead.	49	5	3
607	 He kept his house in power through sheer will.	49	5	3
608	 Without him,	49	5	3
609	 Jaime has one hand and no allies,	49	5	3
610	 Tommen is a soft boy,	49	5	3
611	 not a king to fear.	49	5	3
612	 The Queen will be enraged.	49	5	3
613	 Queen Margaery adores Sansa.	49	5	3
614	 Cersei is Queen Mother,	49	5	3
615	 a title whose importance wanes with each passing day.	49	5	3
616	 You noticed, still as friends	49	5	3
617	 men in important places, whom she can ask for favours.	49	5	3
618	 A message for you, from Cersei Lannister.	49	5	3
619	 A rider arrived from Eyrie, shortly before dawn.	50	5	3
620	 Apparently, she thinks you're still in the Vale.	50	5	3
621	 A message for me, you say.	50	5	3
622	 Strange that the seal is broken.	50	5	3
623	 I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish.	50	5	3
624	 If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother,	50	5	3
625	 it does make me question our new alliance.	50	5	3
626	 Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros.	50	5	3
627	 Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them.	50	5	3
628	 Why gamble with your position?	50	5	3
629	 Every ambitious move is a gamble.	50	5	3
630	 You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart.	50	5	3
631	 It appears that your gamble paid off.	50	5	3
632	 You're Warden of the North.	50	5	3
633	 I had Tywin Lannister backing.	50	5	3
634	 Who supports me now? You?	50	5	3
635	 The Eyrie is mine.	50	5	3
636	 The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North,	50	5	3
637	 they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known.	50	5	3
638	 I'd like to borrow one of your birds.	51	5	3
639	 Cersei will expect a reply.	51	5	3
640	 I'd like to read the reply.	51	5	3
641	 I have to get out of this wheelhouse.	51	5	3
642	 Volantis is a large city.	51	5	3
643	 I have to get out of this wheelhouse.	51	5	3
644	 The likelihood of you being spotted here	51	5	3
645	 increases a hundred fold.	51	5	3
646	 I have to get out of this wheelhouse.	51	5	3
647	 I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.	51	5	3
648	 I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen	51	5	3
649	 if I lose my mind.	51	5	3
650	 I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.	51	5	3
651	 It's a perfectly good face.	51	5	3
652	 I'm losing my mind.	51	5	3
653	 If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than...	52	5	3
654	 Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros.	52	5	3
655	 What am I?	52	5	3
656	 One more drunk dwarf.	52	5	3
657	 We have to go now. Come on.	52	5	3
658	 Hold it, hold it!	52	5	3
659	 - Slaves. - Yes.	52	5	3
660	 The Volantene masters are very organized.	52	5	3
661	 Flies for dung shovelers.	52	5	3
662	 Hammers for builders.	52	5	3
663	 Tears for whores.	53	5	3
664	 Lest they forget.	53	5	3
665	 _	53	5	3
666	 _	53	5	3
667	 We should keep moving.	53	5	3
668	 _	53	5	3
669	 _	53	5	3
670	 _	53	5	3
671	 The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr.	53	5	3
672	 This one's much better looking.	53	5	3
673	 _	53	5	3
674	 _	53	5	3
675	 _	53	5	3
676	 Stone men.	53	5	3
677	 Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer.	53	5	3
678	 You'd have better luck dancing away the plague.	53	5	3
679	 _	53	5	3
680	 _	53	5	3
681	 _	54	5	3
682	 We're going to meet the Saviour.	54	5	3
683	 You should have told me.	54	5	3
684	 Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?	54	5	3
685	 Come on.	54	5	3
686	 Let's find a brothel.	54	5	3
687	 _	54	5	3
688	 It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.	54	5	3
689	 See? We blend right in.	55	5	3
690	 Just two more travellers, mad with lust.	55	5	3
691	 Thank you.	55	5	3
692	 Curious hair.	55	5	3
693	 The Mother of Dragons.	55	5	3
694	 It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter.	55	5	3
695	 Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously.	55	5	3
696	 What makes you worth that much?	55	5	3
697	 The magic.	55	5	3
698	 Well, she's taken.	55	5	3
699	 Where're you going?	56	5	3
700	 I need to speak to someone with hair.	56	5	3
701	 - Hello? - Hello.	56	5	3
702	 - You've got no drink. - You've got no money.	56	5	3
703	 Do I look like a man without money?	56	5	3
704	 Never trust looks.	56	5	3
705	 Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world.	56	5	3
706	 But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh?	56	5	3
707	 I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it.	56	5	3
708	 You like her?	56	5	3
709	 They all like her.	56	5	3
710	 They all want to fuck a queen.	56	5	3
711	 - Because they never met a queen. - You're just saying that.	56	5	3
712	 You know how to spot a liar.	56	5	3
713	 If I could pick any girl here,	56	5	3
714	 I would pick you.	56	5	3
715	 Why?	56	5	3
716	 Because you have a skeptical mind.	56	5	3
717	 Alright, then. I'm warning you. You're gonna have to wash you first.	57	5	3
718	 Come on.	57	5	3
719	 I'm...I'm sorry, I can't.	57	5	3
720	 Of course you can.	57	5	3
721	 You're shy.	57	5	3
722	 I'm not.	57	5	3
723	 Have another drink.	57	5	3
724	 Gladly, but this, I can't do.	57	5	3
725	 Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am.	57	5	3
726	 I hope it passes.	57	5	3
727	 What will I do in my spare time?	57	5	3
728	 Go for a piss, let it stopped	57	5	3
729	 No need to worry, I was just... Oh...	58	5	3
730	 I thought you were someone else.	58	5	3
731	 Show is almost over.	58	5	3
732	 I'm sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige.	58	5	3
733	 You made some kind of mistake. Why don't you tell me what you think you are doing and...	58	5	3
734	 I'm taking you to the Queen.	58	5	3
735		58	5	3
736		0	5	3
0		1	6	6
1	 Burn them all!	3	6	6
2	 Where's my sister?	3	6	6
3	 Burn them all!	3	6	6
4	 Please.	3	6	6
5	 Burn them. Burn them all!	4	6	6
6	 Burn them all!	4	6	6
7	 Meera.	4	6	6
8	 They found us.	4	6	6
9	 I'm so sorry.	4	6	6
10	 Come with me, now.	6	6	6
11	 The dead don't rest.	6	6	6
12	 It's so green.	6	6	6
13	 Oh, yes.	6	6	6
14	 Once you get south of the Riverlands,	6	6	6
15	 very different sorts of trees start to take over.	6	6	6
16	 Maple, elm, beech, poplar.	7	6	6
17	 The odd willow.	7	6	6
18	 And of course now that summer's over,	7	6	6
19	 you'll start seeing the autumn colors coming in.	7	6	6
20	 Still, you'll find more green here than anywhere else.	7	6	6
21	 You're nervous. You're a nervous talker.	7	6	6
22	 That's not any better being a nervous mute.	7	6	6
23	 I didn't think I'd ever come back here	7	6	6
24	 after my father made me renounce my title	7	6	6
25	 and inheritance	7	6	6
26	 and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn't.	7	6	6
27	 A person just doesn't feel welcome at that point.	7	6	6
28	 And I certainly didn't expect to be introducing him to my family.	7	6	6
29	 So you know what to tell them.	8	6	6
30	 That Little Sam is your baby.	8	6	6
31	 Yes, now that's very important.	8	6	6
32	 If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild,	8	6	6
33	 he'll take you in.	8	6	6
34	 He'll get an education. He'll learn to read.	8	6	6
35	 And you can help teach him. Huh?	8	6	6
36	 What did you tell your family about me?	8	6	6
37	 I told them I met you in the North.	8	6	6
38	 Did you tell them how far north?	8	6	6
39	 Well, it wasn't a very large piece of parchment.	8	6	6
40	 You didn't tell them where I'm really from?	8	6	6
41	 You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?	8	6	6
42	 The thing is...	8	6	6
43	 my father doesn't like wildlings.	8	6	6
44	" He hoped I'd make a man of myself by ""killing some bloody wildlings,"""	8	6	6
45	 so it's probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible.	8	6	6
46	 I think we're here.	9	6	6
47	 Sam.	9	6	6
48	 Oh, Sam.	9	6	6
49	 Oh, hello, Mother.	9	6	6
50	 I never thought I'd see you again.	9	6	6
51	 - You look wonderful. - Oh.	9	6	6
52	 Talla?	9	6	6
53	 Gods, you're a woman now.	9	6	6
54	 Father says I have to marry Symun Fossoway.	10	6	6
55	 - He has yellow teeth-- - That's enough, Talla.	10	6	6
56	 Oh, um, Mother, this is Gilly.	10	6	6
57	 Oh, my.	10	6	6
58	 You are lovely.	10	6	6
59	 I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly.	10	6	6
60	 Oh, and this,	10	6	6
61	 this is our son Samwell.	10	6	6
62	 Hello, little one.	10	6	6
63	 It's me, your grandmother.	10	6	6
64	 May I hold him?	10	6	6
65	 Yes, of course.	10	6	6
66	 Oh.	11	6	6
67	 You have a curious mind, I can tell.	11	6	6
68	 You'll be a scholar like your father.	11	6	6
69	 Where is Father? And Dickon?	11	6	6
70	 They're on a hunt.	11	6	6
71	 They'll join us for dinner.	11	6	6
72	 Come inside. Such a journey.	11	6	6
73	 You must be exhausted.	11	6	6
74	 Come, you'll be wanting a bath after all that travel.	11	6	6
75	 Oh, and a dress for dinner.	11	6	6
76	 You can wear one of mine.	11	6	6
77	 What's your color?	11	6	6
78	 Midnight blue or silver?	11	6	6
79	 Silver, maybe. Come.	11	6	6
80	 You can choose one of my bedrooms if you want.	11	6	6
81	 Is there no other way?	11	6	6
82	 You're afraid for her?	12	6	6
83	 Of course I'm afraid for her!	12	6	6
84	 It just seems very dangerous.	12	6	6
85	 She'll be protected the entire way.	12	6	6
86	 The Faith Militant are very stern	12	6	6
87	 with those who overstep their bounds.	12	6	6
88	 And Queen Margaery isn't your mother.	12	6	6
89	 I suspect the gods will predispose the common people	12	6	6
90	 to gentleness on her behalf.	12	6	6
91	 She's truly opened her heart to them.	12	6	6
92	 She's always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.	12	6	6
93	 And now she's devoted to the gods as well.	12	6	6
94	 Would you like to see her?	12	6	6
95	 Have they hurt you?	13	6	6
96	 Have they mistreated you?	13	6	6
97	 - No, Your Grace. - I've missed you.	13	6	6
98	 More than you could know.	13	6	6
99	 We'll be together again soon	13	6	6
100	 and everything will be better than it was before.	13	6	6
101	 Better how?	13	6	6
102	 Soon the--	13	6	6
103	 walk of atonement.	13	6	6
104	 He says there's no other way.	13	6	6
105	 Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?	13	6	6
106	 Yes, a few times.	13	6	6
107	 Have you?	13	6	6
108	 Yes, I have.	13	6	6
109	 He's not quite what we thought he was, is he?	13	6	6
110	 You think I'm mad.	14	6	6
111	 I sound mad.	14	6	6
112	 No. No, you don't.	14	6	6
113	 You-- you could never.	14	6	6
114	 You're right, he's not.	14	6	6
115	 He's a lot more--	14	6	6
116	 He is.	14	6	6
117	 There's something about him.	14	6	6
118	 His way of looking at the world.	14	6	6
119	 It's not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are.	14	6	6
120	 It's taken me a while.	14	6	6
121	 He's helped me.	14	6	6
122	 What are you talking about?	14	6	6
123	 You're a good person. You've always been a good person.	14	6	6
124	 You're the best person I know.	14	6	6
125	 I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.	14	6	6
126	 Ah, yes, I visited their hovels	14	6	6
127	 and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it.	14	6	6
128	 I never gave them what they really needed, though.	14	6	6
129	 I've had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good.	15	6	6
130	 All those stories I told myself about who I was	15	6	6
131	 and why I did the things I did.	15	6	6
132	 There were so many lies in those stories.	15	6	6
133	 I don't understand.	15	6	6
134	 It's all right. It really is.	15	6	6
135	 It's such a relief to let go of those lies.	15	6	6
136	 What about Loras?	15	6	6
137	 I love my brother.	15	6	6
138	 I will always love my brother.	15	6	6
139	 His soul is pure and perfect.	15	6	6
140	 His sins don't erase that purity,	15	6	6
141	 they only obscure it.	15	6	6
142	 He just needs to atone for them.	15	6	6
143	 We all do.	16	6	6
144	 Sooner or later, one way or another.	16	6	6
145	 The gods have a plan for us all.	16	6	6
146	 It's hard to walk in this.	16	6	6
147	 It's beautiful.	16	6	6
148	 You're beautiful.	16	6	6
149	 This venison, it's very tasty.	17	6	6
150	 Is it from today's hunt?	17	6	6
151	 Well, no.	17	6	6
152	 We haven't been able to cure that one yet.	17	6	6
153	 This is last week's.	17	6	6
154	 Oh, of course. Sorry.	17	6	6
155	 Long journey.	17	6	6
156	 Brought it down from 70 yards.	18	6	6
157	 One shot.	18	6	6
158	 Oh, that's a fair distance.	18	6	6
159	 So do you do much hunting up at the Wall?	18	6	6
160	 Oh, yes. Yes.	18	6	6
161	 A good amount.	18	6	6
162	 North of the Wall,	18	6	6
163	 you don't hunt, you don't eat.	18	6	6
164	 Mm-hmm.	18	6	6
165	 Mostly deer or is it elk as well?	18	6	6
166	 Rabbits.	18	6	6
167	 Sometimes squirrels.	18	6	6
168	" I say ""we,"" it's my friend Jon mostly."	18	6	6
169	 Sometimes Edd.	18	6	6
170	 Oh, and Gilly.	18	6	6
171	 She's-- she's quite a good hunter as well.	18	6	6
172	 Um, huntress.	18	6	6
173	 I imagine it's common where you're from.	18	6	6
174	 We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll,	18	6	6
175	 who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt.	19	6	6
176	 Your father taught you to hunt?	19	6	6
177	 Our father would never teach us.	19	6	6
178	 I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.	19	6	6
179	 That's enough of that.	19	6	6
180	 Samwell, would you care for more bread?	19	6	6
181	 Oh, yes. Yes, please.	19	6	6
182	 Thank you, Mother.	19	6	6
183	 Not fat enough already?	19	6	6
184	 I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander.	19	6	6
185	 - He wants me to-- - I read your letter.	19	6	6
186	 You're to be a maester.	19	6	6
187	 Yes.	19	6	6
188	 And once I have my chain,	19	6	6
189	 I'll return to Castle Black.	20	6	6
190	 I thought the Night's Watch might make a man of you.	20	6	6
191	 Something resembling a man at least.	20	6	6
192	 You managed to stay soft and fat.	20	6	6
193	 Your nose buried in books.	20	6	6
194	 Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men.	20	6	6
195	 I'll wager you still can't sit a horse or wield a sword.	20	6	6
196	 Randyll, to be maester of the Night's Watch is a great honor.	20	6	6
197	 He can wield a sword.	20	6	6
198	 He killed a Thenn.	20	6	6
199	 He killed a white walker.	20	6	6
200	 There's no such thing.	20	6	6
201	 I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black.	20	6	6
202	 He drove a dagger into the walker's heart.	20	6	6
203	 He risked his own life to save mine more than once.	21	6	6
204	 He's a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.	21	6	6
205	 Your way down to Castle Black?	21	6	6
206	 Where did he kill a white walker?	21	6	6
207	 Where are you from?	21	6	6
208	 How'd you come to meet my son?	21	6	6
209	 The Night's Watch came to our keep.	21	6	6
210	 - Where? - Gilly.	21	6	6
211	 - North of the Wall. - North of the Wall?	21	6	6
212	 You're a wildling.	21	6	6
213	 The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries	21	6	6
214	 and here I sit hosting one in my hall	22	6	6
215	 thanks to my son.	22	6	6
216	 See that sword?	22	6	6
217	 It's called Heartsbane.	22	6	6
218	 It's been in our family for 500 years.	22	6	6
219	 It's Valyrian steel.	22	6	6
220	 Only a handful of them left in the world.	22	6	6
221	 It's supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die.	22	6	6
222	 To him.	22	6	6
223	 He will never wield that sword.	22	6	6
224	 If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill,	22	6	6
225	 it would be the end of this house.	22	6	6
226	 I took you for a Mole's Town whore when I saw you	22	6	6
227	 and I made my peace with that.	22	6	6
228	 Who else would have him?	22	6	6
229	 But I overestimated him.	23	6	6
230	 No.	23	6	6
231	 It was a wildling whore that seduced my son.	23	6	6
232	 This you getting back at me, boy?	23	6	6
233	 Hmm? Bringing that to my table and making me dine with it?	23	6	6
234	 And you got what you were after, didn't you?	23	6	6
235	 A bastard. A half-breed bastard.	23	6	6
236	 Your invitation into our home.	23	6	6
237	 Come, my dear. Talla.	23	6	6
238	 I've lost my appetite.	23	6	6
239	 He dishonors us.	23	6	6
240	 You dishonor yourself.	23	6	6
241	 Your mother's a fine woman. You're not worthy of her.	23	6	6
242	 To please her, I'll take the wildling in. She can work in the kitchens.	24	6	6
243	 The bastard will be raised here.	24	6	6
244	 But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill.	24	6	6
245	 I'm sorry I let him treat you that way.	24	6	6
246	 I was afraid he'd turn you and Little Sam away.	24	6	6
247	 I'm not angry at you.	24	6	6
248	 I'm angry that horrible people	24	6	6
249	 can treat good people that way and get away with it.	24	6	6
250	 When do you have to go?	24	6	6
251	 First light.	25	6	6
252	 Say good-bye to him for me.	25	6	6
253	 You're not what he thinks you are, Sam.	25	6	6
254	 He doesn't know what you are.	25	6	6
255	 Good-bye, Gilly.	25	6	6
256	 - Sam? - We're leaving.	26	6	6
257	 - What? - Get your things.	26	6	6
258	 I don't have any things.	26	6	6
259	 - What are you doing? - We belong together.	26	6	6
260	 All of us.	26	6	6
261	 What about your mother and sister?	26	6	6
262	 Oh, they'll understand.	26	6	6
263	 Your sister's dress.	26	6	6
264	 She won't mind.	26	6	6
265	 Looks better on you anyway.	26	6	6
266	 Sam.	26	6	6
267	 That's your father's sword.	26	6	6
268	 It's my family's sword.	27	6	6
269	 Sam.	27	6	6
270	 Won't he come for it?	27	6	6
271	 He can bloody well try.	27	6	6
272	 The lion and the rose are one.	27	6	6
273	 I thank the gods above.	27	6	6
274	 And to you, my beauteous bride,	27	6	6
275	 I pledge undying love.	27	6	6
276	 Hail King Joffrey. Hail Queen Margaery.	27	6	6
277	 I'll drink a toast to my new queen,	27	6	6
278	 for there is no one fairer.	27	6	6
279	 Dear Uncle, will you share my joy and be my royal cupbearer?	27	6	6
280	 Drink long and deep, my noble king,	27	6	6
281	 from this cup of sweet wine.	27	6	6
282	 The last drink he shall ever take.	27	6	6
283	 And vengeance shall be mine.	27	6	6
284	 Poison!	28	6	6
285	 Murder!	28	6	6
286	 I gasp. I-- I die.	28	6	6
287	 I limp.	28	6	6
288	 And it was he...	28	6	6
289	 ...that poisoned me.	28	6	6
290	 My evil Uncle Imp.	28	6	6
291	 Calm down, dear.	28	6	6
292	 My firstborn son.	28	6	6
293	 My golden lion	28	6	6
294	 foully, falsely slain.	28	6	6
295	 I pray you found a lasting peace	29	6	6
296	 free from strife and pain.	29	6	6
297	 Hear my prayer, O cruel gods.	29	6	6
298	 Take my life instead.	29	6	6
299	 For I cannot face another day when my sweet boy is dead.	29	6	6
300	 Oh, woe.	29	6	6
301	 Oh, grief.	29	6	6
302	 Oh, darkest day, my heart is full of sorrow.	29	6	6
303	 All hope is lost.	29	6	6
304	 All joy is gone.	29	6	6
305	 And there is no tomorrow.	29	6	6
306	 What is that I hear and smell?	30	6	6
307	 Someone I'll soon send to hell.	30	6	6
308	 It's time to see if truth they told	30	6	6
309	 who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.	30	6	6
310	 You beast. You beast.	30	6	6
311	 You killed my wife and now you've taken your father's life.	30	6	6
312	 No worse child ever stained this land.	30	6	6
313	 Curse the day I named you.	30	6	6
314	 My greatest crime. Now I must flee.	30	6	6
315	 Then sail across the Narrow Sea	30	6	6
316	 to do unto you more treachery.	31	6	6
317	 Don't fear winter. Fear me!	31	6	6
318	 Thank you.	31	6	6
319	 Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Bianca,	31	6	6
320	 Clarenzo.	31	6	6
321	 I give you Bobono.	31	6	6
322	 I give you Camello.	31	6	6
323	 And last but not least,	31	6	6
324	 sweet Lady Crane.	31	6	6
325	 Give this a good beating. Shake those fleas out. That's a dear.	31	6	6
326	 That crowd was shit.	31	6	6
327	 Girl.	32	6	6
328	 What are you doing back here?	32	6	6
329	 Nothing.	32	6	6
330	 I saw you the other day in the audience.	32	6	6
331	 How many times have you seen this stupid play?	32	6	6
332	 Three times.	32	6	6
333	 Did you pay?	32	6	6
334	 No.	32	6	6
335	 I remember when the players came to my village.	32	6	6
336	 I didn't have any money, so I snuck in.	32	6	6
337	 Just like you.	32	6	6
338	 Saw the painted faces, the costumes,	32	6	6
339	 listened to the songs,	32	6	6
340	 cried when the young lovers died in each other's arms.	32	6	6
341	 I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back.	32	6	6
342	 You're very good.	32	6	6
343	 My final speech is shit.	32	6	6
344	 But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be,	32	6	6
345	 the writing's no good.	32	6	6
346	 So change it.	33	6	6
347	 It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you.	33	6	6
348	 How would you change it?	33	6	6
349	 The queen loves her son more than anything.	33	6	6
350	 And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye.	33	6	6
351	 She wouldn't just cry.	33	6	6
352	 She would be angry.	33	6	6
353	 She would want to kill the person who did this to her.	33	6	6
354	 What's your name?	33	6	6
355	 Mercy.	33	6	6
356	 You have very expressive eyes, Mercy.	33	6	6
357	 Wonderful eyebrows.	33	6	6
358	 Do you like pretending to be other people?	33	6	6
359	 I have to go. My father's waiting for me.	34	6	6
360	 Lady Crane, they loved you.	34	6	6
361	 They were sweet. Or drunk.	34	6	6
362	 Drunkenly sweet.	34	6	6
363	 No laugh for Ned's death.	34	6	6
364	 These people are worse than animals.	34	6	6
365	 But they loved her. They all love her.	34	6	6
366	 Yes, you are adored by people and animals alike.	34	6	6
367	 I do what I can with what I'm given.	34	6	6
368	 With what you're given?	34	6	6
369	 Well, I was thinking--	34	6	6
370	 Oh, we're all thinkers now, are we?	34	6	6
371	 Full to the tits with ideas.	34	6	6
372	 - I didn't mean-- - You have ideas, I have ideas,	34	6	6
373	 he has ideas.	34	6	6
374	 Why should my ideas have any more value than yours	34	6	6
375	 simply because I've been doing this my whole life?	35	6	6
376	 Who is anyone to judge my work?	35	6	6
377	 This is my profession. I know what I'm doing.	35	6	6
378	 You have no right to an opinion.	35	6	6
379	 Careful of that one.	35	6	6
380	 She wants you dead.	35	6	6
381	 And?	36	6	6
382	 As I expected.	36	6	6
383	 A shame.	36	6	6
384	 A girl had many gifts.	36	6	6
385	 You promised me.	36	6	6
386	 Don't let her suffer.	36	6	6
387	 Company, halt!	37	6	6
388	 My lord.	37	6	6
389	 My lord.	37	6	6
390	 My friends, the hour has come.	37	6	6
391	 Madness has overtaken this city	38	6	6
392	 and grasped in its claws my children.	38	6	6
393	 But now we must drive it back	38	6	6
394	 under the rocks whence it came.	38	6	6
395	 Madness has had its day!	38	6	6
396	 Forward, march!	38	6	6
397	 Rich or poor, noble or common,	38	6	6
398	 if we sin, we must atone.	38	6	6
399	 Margaery of House Tyrell	38	6	6
400	 came to us a sinner.	38	6	6
401	 She stood before the gods	38	6	6
402	 in the holy sept and lied.	38	6	6
403	 She turned a blind eye to her brother's sins.	38	6	6
404	 She disgraced her house,	39	6	6
405	 her king, and herself.	39	6	6
406	 Company, halt!	39	6	6
407	 Face front!	39	6	6
408	 Turn!	39	6	6
409	 Lord Tyrell.	39	6	6
410	 Ser Jaime.	39	6	6
411	 Sorry to interrupt.	39	6	6
412	 We're here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell.	40	6	6
413	 Give them to us and we'll be on our way.	40	6	6
414	 I don't have the authority to give them to you.	40	6	6
415	 And you don't have the authority to take them.	40	6	6
416	 That's right.	40	6	6
417	 Hyah.	40	6	6
418	  Lock spears!	40	6	6
419	 I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name.	40	6	6
420	 The gods don't recognize his authority in this matter.	40	6	6
421	 You've already insulted one great house.	40	6	6
422	 It won't happen twice.	40	6	6
423	 Every last sparrow will die	40	6	6
424	 before Margaery Tyrell walks down that street.	40	6	6
425	 To die in the service of the gods	40	6	6
426	 would please each and every one of us.	40	6	6
427	 We yearn for it.	40	6	6
428	 But there is no call for it today.	41	6	6
429	 There will be no walk of atonement.	41	6	6
430	 Order up.	41	6	6
431	 Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins	41	6	6
432	 by bringing another	41	6	6
433	 into the true light of the Seven.	41	6	6
434	 Together we announce	42	6	6
435	 a new age of harmony.	42	6	6
436	 A holy alliance	42	6	6
437	 between the Crown and the Faith.	42	6	6
438	 Long live King Tommen and bless you, Queen Margaery!	43	6	6
439	 The Crown and the Faith	43	6	6
440	 are the twin pillars upon which the world rests.	43	6	6
441	 Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory.	43	6	6
442	 What's happening?	43	6	6
443	 He's beaten us.	43	6	6
444	 That's what's happening.	43	6	6
445	 When you attack the Faith, you attack the Crown.	44	6	6
446	 Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit	44	6	6
447	 to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.	44	6	6
448	 I've been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born.	44	6	6
449	 You don't have to do this. You don't have to do anything.	44	6	6
450	 I have to answer to the gods.	44	6	6
451	 Not when you're sitting in that chair.	44	6	6
452	 The Crown's decision on this matter is final.	44	6	6
453	 Will I be walking naked in the streets?	44	6	6
454	 Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first	44	6	6
455	 to teach me about the gods' mercy?	44	6	6
456	 You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years.	44	6	6
457	 And you will continue to do so.	45	6	6
458	 But not in this city.	45	6	6
459	 You've lost it?	45	6	6
460	 Yes, Father.	45	6	6
461	 It's a castle, not a bloody sheep.	45	6	6
462	 Presumably you still know where it is.	45	6	6
463	 You didn't lose Riverrun.	45	6	6
464	 You let the Blackfish take it from you.	45	6	6
465	 He surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone.	45	6	6
466	 You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding.	45	6	6
467	 You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave.	45	6	6
468	 Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him,	45	6	6
469	 you couldn't find him.	45	6	6
470	 That's what it means to lose something.	45	6	6
471	 Now he's come back and taken Riverrun.	45	6	6
472	 I don't think it's fair to blame us--	45	6	6
473	 For 300 years we kissed Tully boots,	45	6	6
474	 swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners.	45	6	6
475	 Not again. Riverrun is ours.	46	6	6
476	 Take it back.	46	6	6
477	 We don't have the men.	46	6	6
478	 We've got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.	46	6	6
479	  The Mallisters have risen against us. And the Blackwoods.	46	6	6
480	  The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us,	46	6	6
481	 raiding our supply trains and camps.	46	6	6
482	 Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year.	46	6	6
483	 If I want excuses, I'll put her in charge.	46	6	6
484	 They're laughing at us.	46	6	6
485	 All across the Riverlands	46	6	6
486	 right down to King's Landing,	46	6	6
487	 they're laughing at us.	46	6	6
488	 I hear it in my sleep!	46	6	6
489	 I'm not dead yet, unfortunately for you.	46	6	6
490	 And I'll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter.	46	6	6
491	 Take that castle back.	46	6	6
492	 He'll never yield, Father.	46	6	6
493	 Oh, he'll yield.	47	6	6
494	 You'll show him the knife you used	47	6	6
495	 to kill Robb Stark's child in his whore mother's belly,	47	6	6
496	 and you'll show him the knife you used	47	6	6
497	 to open his niece's throat.	47	6	6
498	 And you'll remind him who it was	47	6	6
499	 that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place.	47	6	6
500	 His nephew.	47	6	6
501	 Cheer up, Lord Edmure.	47	6	6
502	 You're going home.	47	6	6
503	 I'm being sent to deal with the Blackfish.	47	6	6
504	 Apparently Walder Frey can't manage it on his own	47	6	6
505	 because he's 400 years old.	48	6	6
506	 Sent me with an army to the Riverlands	48	6	6
507	 and a siege that could last months.	48	6	6
508	 Better you're elsewhere at the head of an army	48	6	6
509	 than in the sept dungeons.	48	6	6
510	 I'm not going to the Riverlands.	48	6	6
511	 What, then?	48	6	6
512	 I'm going to give Bronn	48	6	6
513	 the largest bag of gold anyone's ever seen	48	6	6
514	 and have him gather the best killers he knows.	48	6	6
515	 I'll take them to the sept and I'll remove the High Sparrow's head	48	6	6
516	 and every other sparrow head I can find.	48	6	6
517	 - You can't. - He has our son! He stole our son!	48	6	6
518	 He's torn our family apart.	48	6	6
519	 How should we treat people who tear us apart?	48	6	6
520	 We should treat them without mercy and we will.	48	6	6
521	 But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won't leave the sept alive.	48	6	6
522	 And without you, this is all for nothing.	48	6	6
523	 Stand at the head of our army where you belong,	48	6	6
524	 where Father wanted you.	49	6	6
525	 Show our men where their loyalties belong.	49	6	6
526	 Show them what Lannisters are,	49	6	6
527	 what we do to our enemies.	49	6	6
528	 And take that stupid little castle back	49	6	6
529	 because it's ours and because you can.	49	6	6
530	 You'll stand trial soon. I need to be here for you.	49	6	6
531	 It will be a trial by combat.	49	6	6
532	 I have the Mountain.	49	6	6
533	 They've made us both stronger, all of them.	49	6	6
534	 They have no idea how strong we are.	49	6	6
535	 No idea what we're going to do to them.	49	6	6
536	 We've always been together.	49	6	6
537	 We'll always be together.	49	6	6
538	 We're the only two people in the world.	50	6	6
539	 Why did you help us?	50	6	6
540	 The Three-Eyed Raven sent for me.	50	6	6
541	 The Three-Eyed Raven's dead.	50	6	6
542	 Now he lives again.	50	6	6
543	 When I last saw you, you were a boy.	50	6	6
544	 A fearless boy.	50	6	6
545	 Loved to climb the castle walls, frighten his mother.	51	6	6
546	 Who are you?	51	6	6
547	 Uncle Benjen.	51	6	6
548	 The last letter Jon wrote me	51	6	6
549	 said you had been lost beyond the Wall.	51	6	6
550	 I led a ranging party deep into the North	51	6	6
551	 to find white walkers.	51	6	6
552	 They found us.	51	6	6
553	 A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice.	51	6	6
554	 Left me there to die.	51	6	6
555	 To turn.	51	6	6
556	 The Children found me.	51	6	6
557	 Stopped the walker's magic from taking hold.	52	6	6
558	 How?	52	6	6
559	 The same way they made the walkers in the first place.	52	6	6
560	 You saw it yourself.	52	6	6
561	 Dragonglass.	52	6	6
562	 A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.	52	6	6
563	 You are the Three-Eyed Raven now.	52	6	6
564	 I didn't have time to learn. I can't control anything.	52	6	6
565	 You must learn to control it	52	6	6
566	 before the Night King comes.	52	6	6
567	 Drink.	52	6	6
568	 One way or another,	52	6	6
569	 he will find his way to the world of men.	52	6	6
570	 When he does,	52	6	6
571	 you will be there waiting for him.	52	6	6
572	 And you will be ready.	52	6	6
573	 Everything all right?	53	6	6
574	 How many days' ride to Meereen?	53	6	6
575	 A week at best.	53	6	6
576	 How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?	53	6	6
577	 Dothraki and all their horses,	53	6	6
578	 the Unsullied, the Second Sons--	53	6	6
579	 1,000 ships easily.	53	6	6
580	 - Probably more. - And who has that many?	53	6	6
581	 Nobody.	53	6	6
582	 Nobody yet.	53	6	6
583	 So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros.	53	6	6
584	 And what then?	53	6	6
585	 I take what is mine.	53	6	6
586	 You weren't made to sit on a chair in a palace.	54	6	6
587	 What was I made for?	54	6	6
588	 You're a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn.	54	6	6
589	 Wait here.	54	6	6

20	 How many of your brothers do you think you can trust?	5	6	1
21	 Trust?	5	6	1
22	 The men in this room.	5	6	1
23	  Does the wolf know you?	6	6	1
24	 We need all the help we can get.	6	6	1
25	 (knocking on door)	6	6	1
26	  Ser Davos.	6	6	1
27	 (door closes)	6	6	1
28	  I saw him in the flames	7	6	1
29	 fighting at Winterfell.	7	6	1
30	 I can't speak for the flames...	7	6	1
31	 but he's gone.	7	6	1
32	 (men shouting)	7	6	1
33	  He was our Lord Commander.	7	6	1
34	 Man #2: He never should have been!	7	6	1
35	 (pounds)	7	6	1
36	 - You all know why you're here. - (shouting stops)	8	6	1
37	 (men murmuring)	8	6	1
38	 Jon Snow is dead.	8	6	1
39	 Who killed him?	8	6	1
40	 - I did. - (shouting resumes)	8	6	1
41	 And Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck	8	6	1
42	 and the other officers in this castle.	8	6	1
43	 - Murderers! - Traitors!	8	6	1
44	 - (men shouting) - (pounds on table)	8	6	1
45	 - You're right! - (shouting stops)	8	6	1
46	 We've committed treason, all of us.	8	6	1
47	 Jon Snow was my Lord Commander.	8	6	1
48	 I had no love for him.	8	6	1
49	 That was no secret.	8	6	1
50	 But I never once disobeyed an order.	8	6	1
51	 Loyalty is the foundation	8	6	1
52	 on which the Night's Watch is built.	8	6	1
53	 And the Watch means everything to me.	8	6	1
54	 I have given my life,	8	6	1
55	 we have all given our lives to the Night's Watch.	8	6	1
56	 Jon Snow was going to destroy the Night's Watch.	9	6	1
57	 He let the wildlings through our gates	9	6	1
58	 as no Lord Commander has ever done before.	9	6	1
59	 He gave them the very land on which they reaved	9	6	1
60	 and raped and murdered.	9	6	1
61	 Lord Commander Snow did what he thought was right,	9	6	1
62	 I've no doubt about that.	9	6	1
63	 And what he thought was right would have been the end of us.	9	6	1
64	 He thrust a terrible choice upon us.	9	6	1
65	 And we made it.	9	6	1
66	 (men murmuring)	9	6	1
67	 (whimpering)	10	6	1
68	  He'll have seen we didn't come.	10	6	1
69	 Thorne will have made it official by now.	10	6	1
70	 Castle Black is his.	10	6	1
71	 I don't care who's sitting at the high table.	10	6	1
72	 Jon was my friend.	10	6	1
73	 And those fuckers butchered him.	10	6	1
74	 Now we return the favor.	10	6	1
75	 We don't have the numbers.	10	6	1
76	 - We have a direwolf. - It's not enough.	10	6	1
77	 I didn't know Lord Commander Snow for long,	10	6	1
78	 but I have to believe he wouldn't have wanted his friends to die for nothing.	10	6	1
79	 If you were planning to see tomorrow, you picked the wrong room.	10	6	1
80	 We all die today.	10	6	1
81	 I say we do our best to take Thorne with us when we go.	10	6	1
82	 We need to fight, but we don't need to die.	10	6	1
83	 - Not if we have help. - Who is gonna help us?	10	6	1
84	 You're not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow.	10	6	1
85	 Bolt the door.	11	6	1
86	 Don't let anyone in.	11	6	1
87	 I'll be back as soon as I can.	11	6	1
88	 (door closes)	11	6	1
89	 (bolt clicks)	11	6	1
90	 (wind howling)	11	6	1
91	  She was 11 the first time I saw her.	11	6	1
92	 The kennelmaster's daughter.	11	6	1
93	 She smelled of dog.	11	6	1
94	 I wasn't much older, but everybody was already afraid of me.	11	6	1
95	 You certainly were.	11	6	1
96	 Myranda wasn't, though.	12	6	1
97	 What could I do to her that those hounds couldn't?	12	6	1
98	 She was fearless.	12	6	1
99	 There was nothing she wouldn't do.	12	6	1
100	 Your pain will be paid for a thousand times over.	12	6	1
101	 I wish you could be here to watch.	12	6	1
102	  Shall I have a grave dug for her, my lord?	12	6	1
103	 Or would you rather the men build a pyre?	12	6	1
104	 Buried, burned?	12	6	1
105	 This is good meat.	12	6	1
106	 Feed it to the hounds.	12	6	1
107	  Your command of the cavalry was impressive.	13	6	1
108	 Thanks to you, the false king Stannis Baratheon is dead.	13	6	1
109	 Do you know who struck the killing blow?	13	6	1
110	 - No. - A shame.	13	6	1
111	 I'd reward the man.	13	6	1
112	 Still, a great victory.	13	6	1
113	 Do you feel like a victor?	13	6	1
114	 I rebelled against the crown	13	6	1
115	 to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark.	13	6	1
116	 Do you think that burning wagons in the night	13	6	1
117	 and mowing down tired, outnumbered Baratheons	13	6	1
118	 is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned Lannister army?	13	6	1
119	 No.	13	6	1
120	 A reckoning will come.	13	6	1
121	 We need the North to face it.	13	6	1
122	 The entire North.	13	6	1
123	 They won't back us without Sansa Stark.	13	6	1
124	 We no longer have Sansa Stark.	14	6	1
125	 You played your games with her.	14	6	1
126	 You played your games with the heir to the Iron Islands and now they're both gone.	14	6	1
127	 I have a team of men after them with some of my best hounds.	14	6	1
128	 They won't get far.	14	6	1
129	 I'm glad to hear it.	14	6	1
130	 Without Sansa, you won't be able to produce an heir.	14	6	1
131	 And without an heir, well...	14	6	1
132	 let's hope the maesters are right	14	6	1
133	 and Lady Walda's carrying a boy.	14	6	1
134	 (dogs barking)	14	6	1
135	 (barking continues)	14	6	1
136	 (panting)	14	6	1
137	 We can't stop.	15	6	1
138	 (barking continues)	15	6	1

218	 Mother.	25	6	1
219	 All I could think about when she died	25	6	1
220	 was what would happen to her now.	25	6	1
221	 Every day, every night,	25	6	1
222	 what does Mama look like now?	25	6	1
223	 Has she started to bloat?	25	6	1
224	 Has her skin turned black?	25	6	1
225	 Have her lips peeled back from her teeth?	25	6	1
226	 I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt.	25	6	1
227	 I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse.	25	6	1
228	 Shh, shh. Don't think about it.	26	6	1
229	 I have to.	26	6	1
230	 I have to. It's not right she has to suffer alone.	26	6	1
231	 She's not suffering. She's gone.	26	6	1
232	 No one can hurt her anymore.	26	6	1
233	 She was good.	26	6	1
234	 From her first breath, she was so sweet.	26	6	1
235	 I don't know where she came from.	26	6	1
236	 She was nothing like me.	26	6	1
237	 No meanness, no jealousy, just good.	26	6	1
238	 I know.	26	6	1
239	 I thought if I could make something so good,	26	6	1
240	 so pure...	26	6	1
241	 - maybe I'm not a monster. - Listen-- listen to me.	26	6	1
242	 She was my daughter and I failed her.	26	6	1
243	 No, I knew this would happen.	27	6	1
244	 The witch told me years ago.	27	6	1
245	 She promised me three children and she promised me they'd die.	27	6	1

248	 You couldn't have stopped it.	27	6	1
249	 It's prophecy. It's fate.	27	6	1
250	 - You don't believe that. - Of course I do.	27	6	1
251	 You told me yourself when Father died.	27	6	1
252	 You said we had to stay together.	27	6	1
253	 You said people would try to tear us apart, take what's ours.	27	6	1
254	 That was a prophecy, too.	27	6	1
255	 I didn't listen to you and everything you said came true.	27	6	1
256	 Fuck prophecy. Fuck fate.	27	6	1
257	 Fuck everyone who isn't us.	27	6	1
258	 We're the only ones who matter,	27	6	1

280	 Septa Unella can be overzealous at times.	29	6	1
281	 I'll speak with her.	29	6	1
282	 My brother, can you tell me how he is?	29	6	1
283	 It isn't Ser Loras that brings me here.	29	6	1
284	 Your husband misses you dearly.	29	6	1
285	 The love between a man and wife is sacred.	29	6	1
286	 It reflects the love the gods have for all of us.	29	6	1
287	 But sin leads us away from the sacred.	29	6	1
288	 And only confession can purge sin.	29	6	1
289	 I have nothing to confess.	30	6	1
290	 So you believe you are pure?	30	6	1
291	 Perfect?	30	6	1

298	 He lived.	30	6	1
299	 He truly lived.	30	6	1
300	 Sailed around the world.	30	6	1
301	 Fought men from every country.	30	6	1
302	 Lay with the most beautiful women alive.	30	6	1
303	 - And men. - And men.	30	6	1
304	 He experienced everything	31	6	1
305	 while I sat here in Dorne	31	6	1
306	 trying my best to keep my people alive and well fed.	31	6	1
307	 But that is life.	31	6	1
308	 We each have our roles.	31	6	1
309	 Oberyn was born to be an adventurer.	31	6	1
310	 And I was born to rule.	31	6	1
311	 The gods are not fools.	31	6	1
312	 You would have been a lousy adventurer.	31	6	1

322	 Elia Martell raped and murdered, and you did nothing.	32	6	1
323	 Oberyn Martell butchered, and you did nothing.	32	6	1

362	 The Sons of the Harpy?	36	6	1
363	 Very possibly.	36	6	1
364	 Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property,	36	6	1
365	 told them human beings weren't even property to begin with.	36	6	1
366	 You can see why they're unhappy.	36	6	1

399	 I don't think she likes it very much.	39	6	1
400	 She's too smart to like it.	39	6	1
401	 Maybe she's flown somewhere else,	39	6	1

536	 Or you can leave her here with us, whichever you choose.	53	6	1
537	 But surrender by nightfall or this ends with blood.	53	6	1
538	 Thank you, Ser Alliser.	54	6	1
539	 We'll discuss amongst ourselves and come back to you with an answer.	54	6	1
540	 (footsteps departing)	54	6	1
541	 Boys, I've been running from men like that all my life.	54	6	1
542	 In my learned opinion, we open that door--	54	6	1
543	 And they'll slaughter us all.	54	6	1
544	 They want to come in, they're gonna come in.	54	6	1
545	 - Aye, but we don't need to make it easy for them. - Edd is our only chance.	54	6	1
546	 It's a sad fucking statement if Dolorous Edd is our only chance.	54	6	1
547	 There's always the Red Woman.	54	6	1
548	 What's one redhead gonna do against 40 armed men?	54	6	1
549	 You haven't seen her do what I've seen her do.	55	6	1

1	 Brother?	1	3	1
2	 Did you send the ravens?	2	3	1
3	 Tarly, look at me.	2	3	1
4	 Did you send the ravens?	2	3	1
5	 That was your job.	2	3	1
6	 Your only job.	2	3	1
7	 We need to get back to the Wall.	3	3	1
8	 It's a long march.	3	3	1
9	 We know what's out there,	3	3	1
10	 but we have to make it, have to warn them	3	3	1
11	 or before winter's done,	3	3	1
12	 everyone you've ever known	3	3	1
13	 will be dead.	3	3	1
14		3	3	1
15	 	3	3	1
16	 First time you've seen a giant, Jon Snow?	6	3	1
17	 Well, don't stare too long. They're shy.	6	3	1
18	 When they stop being shy, they get angry.	6	3	1
19	 And when they're angry,	6	3	1
20	 I've seen them pound a man straight into the ground	6	3	1
21	 like a hammer on a nail.	7	3	1
22	 - Crow! - Crow!	7	3	1
23	 - Look over there! - Crow!	7	3	1
24	 Crow! Look over here! Look!	7	3	1
25	 Ah, look, crow coming!	7	3	1
26	 Crow!	7	3	1
27	 You're wearing the wrong color.	7	3	1
28	 Mance was a ranger.	7	3	1
29	 In your hearts, all you crows want to fly free.	7	3	1
30	 When I'm free, will I be free to go?	7	3	1
31	 - Crow! - Crow!	7	3	1
32	 Sure, you will.	7	3	1
33	 Oh!	7	3	1
34	 And I'll be free to kill you.	7	3	1
35	 Got no respect, this lot.	7	3	1
36	 Got no fathers to slap 'em when they're foul.	7	3	1
37	 What happened to their fathers?	8	3	1
38	 Some of them were killed by crows like you.	8	3	1
39	 Don't look so grim, Jon Snow.	8	3	1
40	 If Mance Rayder likes you, you'll live another day.	8	3	1
41	 And if he don't...	8	3	1
42	 I smell a crow.	8	3	1
43	 We killed his friends.	8	3	1
44	 Thought you'd want to question this one.	8	3	1
45	 What do we want with a baby crow?	8	3	1
46	 This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand.	8	3	1
47	 He wants to be one of us.	8	3	1
48	 That half-handed cunt killed friends of mine.	9	3	1
49	 Friends twice your size.	9	3	1
50	 My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones	9	3	1
51	 if you put a sword through their hearts.	9	3	1
52	 Plenty of little men	9	3	1
53	 tried to put their swords through my heart.	9	3	1
54	 And there's plenty of little skeletons	9	3	1
55	 buried in the woods.	9	3	1
56	 - What's your name, boy? - Jon Snow.	9	3	1
57	 Your Grace.	9	3	1
58	 Your Grace?	9	3	1
59	 Did you hear that?	9	3	1
60	 From now on, you'd better kneel every time I fart.	9	3	1
61	 Stand, boy.	9	3	1
62	 We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall.	10	3	1
63	 So, you're Ned Stark's bastard.	10	3	1
64	 Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones.	10	3	1
65	 You can leave us.	10	3	1
66	 The girl likes you.	10	3	1
67	 You like her back, Snow?	10	3	1
68	 That why you want to join us?	10	3	1
69	 Don't panic, boy.	10	3	1
70	 This isn't the damned Night's Watch	10	3	1
71	 where we make you swear off girls.	10	3	1
72	 This chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane.	10	3	1
73	 Can't believe this pup	10	3	1
74	 killed the Halfhand.	10	3	1
75	 He was our enemy	10	3	1
76	 and I'm glad he's dead.	10	3	1
77	 He was my brother once.	11	3	1
78	 Back when he had a whole hand.	11	3	1
79	 What were you doing with him?	11	3	1
80	 The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.	11	3	1
81	 Why?	11	3	1
82	 He wants me to lead one day.	11	3	1
83	 But here you are, a traitor	11	3	1
84	 kneeling before the King-beyond-the-Wall.	11	3	1
85	 If I'm a traitor, then you are, too.	11	3	1
86	 Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?	11	3	1
87	 I want to be free.	11	3	1
88	 No, I don't think so.	11	3	1
89	 I think what you want most of all	12	3	1
90	 is to be a hero.	12	3	1
91	 I'll ask you one last time--	12	3	1
92	 why do you want to join us?	12	3	1
93	 We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north.	12	3	1
94	 I saw...	12	3	1
95	 You saw what?	12	3	1
96	 I saw Craster take his own baby boy	12	3	1
97	 and leave it in the woods.	12	3	1
98	 I saw what took it.	12	3	1
99	 You're telling me you saw one of them?	12	3	1
100	 And why would that make you desert your brothers?	12	3	1
101	 Because when I told the Lord Commander,	12	3	1
102	 he already knew.	12	3	1
103	 Thousands of years ago, the First Men	13	3	1
104	 battled the White Walkers and defeated them.	13	3	1
105	 I want to fight for the side that fights for the living.	13	3	1
106	 Did I come to the right place?	13	3	1
107	 We'll need to find you a new cloak.	13	3	1
108	 What if you took off that bit there?	13	3	1
109	 Don't you want to leave something to the imagination?	13	3	1
110	 Trouble is, I've never had much imagination.	13	3	1
111	 I want you to take it off.	14	3	1
112	 Mouth.	14	3	1
113	 Ser Bronn. Ser Bronn.	14	3	1
114	 I didn't hear that.	14	3	1
115	 - Apologies, ser. - Back away.	14	3	1
116	 Keep backing away till you're outside this establishment.	14	3	1
117	 - Then back away some more. - Lord Tyrion sent me.	14	3	1
118	 I will murder you, boy.	14	3	1
119	 He said it was a matter of life and death.	14	3	1
120	 - Pod? - It's your sister.	15	3	1
121	 The queen.	15	3	1
122	 What are they doing here?	15	3	1
123	 Protecting me, I assume. Will you let me in?	15	3	1
124	 No, I don't think so.	15	3	1
125	 If I wanted to kill you, do you think	15	3	1
126	 I'd let a wooden door stop me?	15	3	1
127	 They stay outside.	15	3	1
128	 I'm not afraid of you, little brother.	15	3	1
129	 - Why are you here? - I wanted to see your face.	16	3	1
130	 They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that.	16	3	1
131	 The man who cut me lost more than his nose.	16	3	1
132	 I should hope so.	16	3	1
133	 The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own.	16	3	1
134	 Thanks to Father.	16	3	1
135	 Thanks to Father.	16	3	1
136	 Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me.	16	3	1
137	 No? Curious.	16	3	1
138	 Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand.	16	3	1
139	 But then I don't suppose you need much room.	16	3	1
140	 Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke.	16	3	1
141	 You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.	16	3	1
142	 You're meeting Father today?	16	3	1
143	 How do you know that?	16	3	1
144	 Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ.	16	3	1
145	 The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two.	16	3	1
146	 Father told me. What do you want from him?	17	3	1
147	 What do I want from him? He's my father.	17	3	1
148	 Do I need to want something?	17	3	1
149	 I'm sure he loves me dearly,	17	3	1
150	 as any father loves his child,	17	3	1
151	 his baby boy.	17	3	1
152	 Yet he hasn't come to visit once	17	3	1
153	 since arriving in King's Landing.	17	3	1
154	 I lay here, my face split in half,	17	3	1
155	 but Father never came.	17	3	1
156	 You're going to make me cry.	17	3	1
157	 Why do you care what I want from him?	17	3	1
158	 Because you've slandered me to Father before.	17	3	1
159	 Slandered? When?	17	3	1
160	 You told him I had my guards	17	3	1
161	 beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.	17	3	1
162	 You did have your guards beat her.	17	3	1
163	 A girl of nine, I believe.	17	3	1
164	 I was nine, too.	17	3	1
165	 She lost an eye, if I remember correctly.	17	3	1
166	 If I remember correctly,	18	3	1
167	 she never stole a necklace again.	18	3	1
168	 It's not slander if it's true.	18	3	1
169	 And what's this truth you plan on telling him today?	18	3	1
170	 Why are you so nervous	18	3	1
171	 about what I'm going to say to Father?	18	3	1
172	 Because you're a liar.	18	3	1
173	 I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey.	18	3	1
174	 Any lies in particular?	18	3	1
175	 You're a clever man,	18	3	1
176	 but you're not half as clever as you think you are.	18	3	1
177	 Still makes me more clever than you.	18	3	1
178	 Oh, look at these two shining warriors.	18	3	1
179	 Ser Taryn Mant and...	18	3	1
180	 Ser Whosit of Whocares.	18	3	1
181	 Ser Meryn Trant.	18	3	1
182	 Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.	18	3	1
183	 - You're no knight. - Pod.	18	3	1
184	 Ser Bronn of the Blackwater	18	3	1
185	 was anointed by the king himself.	18	3	1
186	 You're an up-jumped cutthroat,	19	3	1
187	 nothing more.	19	3	1
188	 That's exactly who I am.	19	3	1
189	 And you're a grub in fancy armor	19	3	1
190	 who's better at beating little girls than fighting men.	19	3	1
191	 Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion.	19	3	1
192	 You put your hand on that door,	19	3	1
193	 you lose the hand.	19	3	1
194	 As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship,	19	3	1
195	 I am wondering why you sent for me.	19	3	1
196	 A number of people in this city want to kill me.	19	3	1
197	 You're here to protect me.	19	3	1
198	 I've been doing that for a while now.	19	3	1
199	 Do you grow bored protecting me?	19	3	1
200	 I grow poor protecting you.	19	3	1
201	 Poor? Poor?	19	3	1
202	 Under my patronage you've become a knight,	19	3	1
203	 you've served as Commander of the City Watch.	19	3	1
204	 - Briefly. - I'm sure you filled your pockets.	20	3	1
205	 And now my pockets are empty.	20	3	1
206	 You've given me a taste for the finer things.	20	3	1
207	 And if you want me to carry on protecting you,	20	3	1
208	 you'll need to pay more.	20	3	1
209	 - I thought we were friends. - We are.	20	3	1
210	 But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword.	20	3	1
211	 I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.	20	3	1
212	 - How much? - Double.	20	3	1
213	 - Double? - I'm a knight now.	20	3	1
214	 Knights are worth double.	20	3	1
215	 I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.	20	3	1
216	 Which means you can afford it.	20	3	1
217	 Here. Here!	21	3	1
218	 Help me!	21	3	1
219	 Who are you?	21	3	1
220	 I was in the battle at Blackwater.	21	3	1
221	 I was a captain and a knight.	22	3	1
222	 Aye, ser, and serving which king?	22	3	1
223	 The one true king of Westeros--	22	3	1
224	 Stannis Baratheon.	22	3	1
225	 I thought you were dead.	22	3	1
226	 Everyone thought you were dead.	22	3	1
227	 And your son?	22	3	1
228	 He may have swam ashore as you did.	22	3	1
229	 No, the wildfire took him. I saw it.	22	3	1
230	 I'm so sorry, my friend.	23	3	1
231	 I, too, have lost a son.	23	3	1
232	 There is nothing worse in this world.	23	3	1
233	 But, Davos, you were a good father.	23	3	1
234	 If I was a good father, he'd still be here.	23	3	1
235	 Stannis lives?	23	3	1
236	 He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.	23	3	1
237	 Will you take me there?	23	3	1
238	 There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.	23	3	1
239	 This war is not over.	23	3	1
240	 Not for you, maybe.	23	3	1
241	 But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over.	23	3	1
242	 We're both sworn to King Stannis.	23	3	1
243	 I am sworn to no man.	23	3	1
244	 I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory.	23	3	1
245	 I delivered the ships.	23	3	1
246	 Stannis never gives up. Never.	23	3	1
247	 - Now he will regroup-- - He's a broken man.	23	3	1
248	 His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.	24	3	1
249	 They say he sees no one--	24	3	1
250	 not his generals, not even his wife.	24	3	1
251	 Only the Red Woman	24	3	1
252	 whispering in his ear,	24	3	1
253	 telling him what she sees in the flames	24	3	1
254	 and burning men alive.	24	3	1
255	 What?	24	3	1
256	 They built a great fire when Stannis returned.	24	3	1
257	 All those who spoke against her she called	24	3	1
258	 servants of darkness.	24	3	1
259	 They say she sang to them as they burned.	24	3	1
260	 I'm a pirate.	24	3	1
261	 You're a smuggler.	24	3	1
262	 Servants of darkness.	24	3	1
263	 I'm thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid.	24	3	1
264	 Take me back there, please.	24	3	1
265	 You cannot turn Stannis against her.	24	3	1
266	 Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out.	24	3	1
267	 You could try.	24	3	1
268	 If you fail, they will burn you.	24	3	1
269	 If you succeed, they'll burn you.	25	3	1
270	 And you've only just come back to life.	25	3	1
271	 Stay alive a little longer, my friend.	25	3	1
272	 You call me friend. You drank with me on my wedding day.	25	3	1
273	 And you drank with me on four of my wedding days,	25	3	1
274	 but I don't ask you for favors.	25	3	1
275	 I have to stop her.	25	3	1
276	 Please, do this for me.	25	3	1
277	 When you are dead,	25	3	1
278	 I will gather your bones in a little sack	25	3	1
279	 and let your widow wear them around her neck.	25	3	1
280	 We should set the siege lines 1,000 yards from Harrenhal.	25	3	1
281	 There won't be a siege. The Mountain can't defend a ruin.	25	3	1
282	 I imagine the Mountain will defend	25	3	1
283	 whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend.	25	3	1
284	 The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross.	25	3	1
285	 I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight.	26	3	1
286	 I don't think we're going to get one.	26	3	1
287	 200 Northmen slaughtered like sheep.	26	3	1
288	 The debt will be repaid, my friend.	27	3	1
289	 For them and for your sons.	27	3	1
290	 Will it?	27	3	1
291	 They rot in the ground	27	3	1
292	 while their killer runs free.	27	3	1
293	 The Kingslayer won't remain free for long.	27	3	1
294	 My best hunters are after him.	27	3	1
295	 - A Mallister? - Ser Jeremy.	27	3	1
296	 My father's bannerman.	27	3	1
297	 Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell.	28	3	1
298	 She's your mother.	28	3	1
299	 She freed Jaime Lannister.	28	3	1
300	 The Lannisters robbed them of their sons	28	3	1
301	 and she robbed them of their justice.	28	3	1
302	 Water.	28	3	1
303	 Water.	28	3	1
304	 This needs to be cleaned and closed.	28	3	1
305	 What's your name, friend?	28	3	1
306	 Qyburn.	28	3	1
307	 You're lucky to be alive.	28	3	1
308	 Lucky?	29	3	1
309	 The badge looks good on you.	29	3	1
310	 Almost as good as it looked on me.	29	3	1
311	 Are you enjoying your new position?	29	3	1
312	 Am I enjoying it?	29	3	1
313	 I was very happy as Hand of the King.	29	3	1
314	 Yes.	29	3	1
315	 I heard how happy you were.	29	3	1
316	 You brought a whore into my bed.	30	3	1
317	 It wasn't your bed at the time.	30	3	1
318	 I sent you here to advise the king.	30	3	1
319	 I gave you real power and authority.	30	3	1
320	 You chose to spend your days	30	3	1
321	 as you always have,	30	3	1
322	 bedding harlots	30	3	1
323	 and drinking with thieves.	30	3	1
324	 Occasionally I drank with the harlots.	30	3	1
325	 What do you want, Tyrion?	30	3	1
326	 Why does everyone assume I want something?	30	3	1
327	 Can't I simply visit with my beloved father?	30	3	1
328	 My beloved father who	30	3	1
329	 somehow forgot to visit his wounded son	30	3	1
330	 after he fell on the battlefield.	30	3	1
331	 Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.	30	3	1
332	 I organized the defense of this city	30	3	1
333	 while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal.	30	3	1
334	 I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate	31	3	1
335	 while your grandson, the king,	31	3	1
336	 quivered in fear behind the walls.	31	3	1
337	 I bled in the mud for our family.	31	3	1
338	 And as my reward,	31	3	1
339	 I was trundled off to some dark little cell.	31	3	1
340	 But what do I want?	31	3	1
341	 A little bloody gratitude would be a start.	31	3	1
342	 Jugglers and singers require applause.	31	3	1
343	 You are a Lannister.	31	3	1
344	 Do you think I demanded a garland of roses	31	3	1
345	 every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield?	31	3	1
346	 Hmm?	31	3	1
347	 Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after	31	3	1
348	 and three of them are in open rebellion.	31	3	1
349	 So tell me what you want.	31	3	1
350	 I want what is mine by right.	31	3	1
351	 Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles.	32	3	1
352	 But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance.	32	3	1
353	 The day Jaime put on the white cloak,	32	3	1
354	 he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock.	32	3	1
355	 I am your son and lawful heir.	32	3	1
356	 You want Casterly Rock?	32	3	1
357	 It is mine by right.	32	3	1
358	 We'll find you accommodations	32	3	1
359	 more suited to your name	32	3	1
360	 and as a reward for your accomplishments	32	3	1
361	 during the battle of Blackwater Bay.	32	3	1
362	 And when the time is right, you will be given a position	32	3	1
363	 fit for your talents	32	3	1
364	 so that you can serve your family	32	3	1
365	 and protect our legacy.	32	3	1
366	 And if you serve faithfully,	32	3	1
367	 you will be rewarded with a suitable wife.	32	3	1
368	 And I would let myself be consumed by maggots	32	3	1
369	 before mocking the family name	33	3	1
370	 and making you heir to Casterly Rock.	33	3	1
371	 - Why? - Why?	33	3	1
372	 You ask that?	33	3	1
373	 You, who killed your mother to come into the world?	33	3	1
374	 You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature	33	3	1
375	 full of envy, lust, and low cunning.	33	3	1
376	 Men's laws give you the right to bear my name	33	3	1
377	 and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine.	33	3	1
378	 And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me	33	3	1
379	 to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion	33	3	1
380	 that was my father's sigil and his father's before him.	33	3	1
381	 But neither gods nor men	33	3	1
382	 will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock	33	3	1
383	 into your whorehouse.	33	3	1
384	 Go, now.	33	3	1
385	 Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock.	34	3	1
386	 Go.	34	3	1
387	 Oh, one more thing.	34	3	1
388	 The next whore I catch in your bed I'll hang.	34	3	1
389	 Dorne. It's going to Dorne.	34	3	1
390	 - Why Dorne? - It's carrying silk	34	3	1
391	 and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange.	34	3	1
392	 But it's not coming back.	34	3	1
393	 The captain's tired of risking his life	34	3	1
394	 so King's Landing lords and ladies	34	3	1
395	 can get drunk on better wine than they deserve.	34	3	1
396	 He's going to stay in Dorne.	35	3	1
397	 Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.	35	3	1
398	 I met some people in Dorne who weren't so beautiful and warm.	35	3	1
399	 Don't ruin the game.	35	3	1
400	 I told you, I don't want to play.	35	3	1
401	 What about that one there?	35	3	1
402	 That one?	35	3	1
403	 It's going to Volantis.	35	3	1
404	 Why?	35	3	1
405	 Because when I got on a ship in Volantis,	35	3	1
406	 it looked like that one.	35	3	1
407	 That's not how the game works.	35	3	1
408	 You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer.	35	3	1
409	 You've got to invent a story	35	3	1
410	 about where the ship is going and why.	35	3	1
411	 Why should I make up a story when I know the truth?	35	3	1
412	 Because the truth	35	3	1
413	 is always either terrible or boring.	35	3	1
414	 Lovely day for it.	35	3	1
415	 Watching the ships.	35	3	1
416	 Lord Baelish.	35	3	1
417	 Might I speak with Lady Sansa	36	3	1
418	 alone for a moment?	36	3	1
419	 I saw your mother not long ago.	36	3	1
420	 She's very eager to see you.	36	3	1
421	 And your sister.	36	3	1
422	 Arya's alive?	36	3	1
423	 You said you'd take me home.	36	3	1
424	 You said King's Landing was your home.	36	3	1
425	 You are the property of the crown.	36	3	1
426	 Stealing you would be treason.	36	3	1
427	 If you were to tell just one person--	36	3	1
428	 - I won't tell anyone. - How do I know?	36	3	1
429	 Because I'm a terrible liar.	36	3	1
430	 You said so yourself.	36	3	1
431	 Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when.	36	3	1
432	 I'm waiting for word on an assignment	37	3	1
433	 that will take me far away from the capital.	37	3	1
434	 When I set sail,	37	3	1
435	 I might be able to take you with me.	37	3	1
436	 But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice.	37	3	1
437	 You're her handmaiden?	37	3	1
438	 Yes. And you're his...?	37	3	1
439	 I help manage his affairs.	37	3	1
440	 - He's an important person. - So is she.	37	3	1
441	 I grew up in the shadow of her father's castle.	37	3	1
442	 The day she was born, they rang the bells	37	3	1
443	 from sunrise till sunset.	37	3	1
444	 We've both done rather well, you and I.	37	3	1
445	 Yes.	37	3	1
446	 Given where we started.	37	3	1
447	 And where is that?	37	3	1
448	 It's not easy for girls like us	38	3	1
449	 to dig our way out.	38	3	1
450	 Watch out for her.	38	3	1
451	 I always do.	38	3	1
452	 Watch out for her with him.	38	3	1
453	 They're growing fast.	39	3	1
454	 Not fast enough.	39	3	1
455	 I can't wait that long.	39	3	1
456	 I need an army.	39	3	1
457	 We'll be in Astapor by nightfall.	39	3	1
458	 Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.	39	3	1
459	 The greatest slave-soldiers in the world.	39	3	1
460	 The distinction means a good deal to some people.	39	3	1
461	 Do those people have any better ideas	39	3	1
462	 about how to put you on the Iron Throne?	39	3	1
463	 It's too beautiful a day to argue.	39	3	1
464	 You're right.	40	3	1
465	 Another lovely day on the high seas.	40	3	1
466	 Don't mock them.	40	3	1
467	 They're the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship.	40	3	1
468	 They followed me across the poison water.	40	3	1
469	 If they'll do it, others will.	40	3	1
470	 And with a true khalasar--	40	3	1
471	 The Dothraki follow strength above all, khaleesi.	40	3	1
472	 You'll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong.	40	3	1
473	 And not before.	40	3	1
474	 Your Grace.	41	3	1
475	 I heard you were dead.	41	3	1
476	 Not yet.	41	3	1
477	 I had hoped to speak to you alone, Your Grace.	41	3	1
478	 We are alone.	41	3	1
479	 Your Grace, you are the rightful king.	41	3	1
480	 Not only by blood.	41	3	1
481	 You're an honorable man, a just man.	41	3	1
482	 And there is still a war to fight.	41	3	1
483	 I am fighting.	41	3	1
484	 By burning prisoners alive?	41	3	1
485	 How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos?	42	3	1
486	 I do not judge people for the gods they worship.	42	3	1
487	 If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea	42	3	1
488	 before you ever set foot on Dragonstone.	42	3	1
489	 - I'm not your enemy. - You are my enemy.	42	3	1
490	 Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay?	42	3	1
491	 Did I set your ships ablaze?	42	3	1
492	 I wasn't there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands.	42	3	1
493	 I could have saved those men.	42	3	1
494	 You would have taken the city,	42	3	1
495	 Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne,	42	3	1
496	 and you would stand beside him.	42	3	1
497	 But I wasn't there	42	3	1
498	 because you convinced your king to leave me behind.	42	3	1
499	 Do you hear them screaming?	42	3	1
500	 All those burning men in the water	43	3	1
501	 crying for their mothers,	43	3	1
502	 for their gods for help?	43	3	1
503	 Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them.	43	3	1
504	 Don't despair, Ser Davos.	43	3	1
505	 What I told your son is true.	43	3	1
506	 Death by fire	43	3	1
507	 is the purest death.	43	3	1
508	 This woman is evil!	43	3	1
509	 She's the mother of demons.	43	3	1
510	 Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell.	43	3	1
511	 - Your Grace! - Come on.	43	3	1
512	 You've chosen the darkness, Ser Davos.	43	3	1
513	 - She will destroy us all! - I will pray for you.	43	3	1
514	 Your Grace!	43	3	1
515	 Halt. Down.	44	3	1
516	 Halt. Down.	44	3	1
517	 Why have we stopped?	44	3	1
518	 It's Lady Margaery, Your Grace.	44	3	1
519	 What is she doing? Who gave her permission?	44	3	1
520	 My lady. We should have guards, my lady.	44	3	1
521	 Why?	44	3	1
522	 Pardon me.	44	3	1
523	 Stop, my lady. You'll ruin your dress.	45	3	1
524	 I have others.	45	3	1
525	 Would you like to speak with her, Your Grace?	45	3	1
526	 No.	45	3	1
527	 He was a soldier.	45	3	1
528	 He went to fight on the walls	45	3	1
529	 when the ships came into Blackwater Bay.	45	3	1
530	 He never came back.	45	3	1
531	 And your mother?	45	3	1
532	 She died when she had me.	45	3	1
533	 Bad men wanted to come into this city	45	3	1
534	 and do terrible things, but your father stopped them.	45	3	1
535	 Whenever you look at this knight,	45	3	1
536	 I want you to remember your father.	45	3	1
537	 He wasn't a knight.	46	3	1
538	 He was just a soldier.	46	3	1
539	 And what do knights swear to do?	46	3	1
540	 Protect the weak and uphold the good.	46	3	1
541	 Your father did that. Be proud of him.	46	3	1
542	 Was your father a soldier, too?	46	3	1
543	 You should be proud, too.	46	3	1
544	 Under King Joffrey's leadership,	46	3	1
545	 your fathers saved the city.	46	3	1
546	 They saved us all.	46	3	1
547	 From now on, we're going to take care of you.	46	3	1
548	 All of you.	46	3	1
549	 Come to me for whatever you need to feed them,	46	3	1
550	 clothe them, or house them.	46	3	1
551	 Directly to me.	47	3	1
552	 - Your Grace. - Your Grace.	47	3	1
553	 Please, sit. Sit.	47	3	1
554	 I do apologize, my lady.	47	3	1
555	 Small council meetings.	47	3	1
556	 At what point does it become treason	47	3	1
557	 to waste the king's time?	47	3	1
558	 That's a lovely gown, my lady.	47	3	1
559	 Yes, it suits you perfectly.	47	3	1
560	 I imagine you might be rather cold.	47	3	1
561	 The climate is a bit more forgiving back in Highgarden, Your Grace.	47	3	1
562	 Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady?	47	3	1
563	 I am touched by your concern, Your Grace.	47	3	1
564	 Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm.	47	3	1
565	 - Doesn't it, Loras? - Yes.	47	3	1
566	 Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent?	48	3	1
567	 The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork.	48	3	1
568	 I've never seen anything like it.	48	3	1
569	 You might find a bit of armor quite useful	48	3	1
570	 once you become queen. Perhaps before.	48	3	1
571	 Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom	48	3	1
572	 on your way back from the sept this morning.	48	3	1
573	 Yes. I paid a visit to an orphanage	48	3	1
574	 the High Septon told me about.	48	3	1
575	 Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden.	48	3	1
576	 The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance	48	3	1
577	 and approach them with an open heart.	48	3	1
578	 An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom	48	3	1
579	 if you're not careful, my dear.	48	3	1
580	 Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there.	48	3	1
581	 We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them.	48	3	1
582	 The king barely escaped with his life.	48	3	1
583	 My mother's always had a penchant for drama.	48	3	1
584	 Facts become less and less important to her	48	3	1
585	 as she grows older.	48	3	1
586	 Our lives were never truly in danger.	49	3	1
587	 You're right, of course.	49	3	1
588	 But you are your father's son.	49	3	1
589	 We can't all have a king's bravery.	49	3	1
590	 Hunger turns men into beasts.	49	3	1
591	 I'm glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard.	49	3	1
592	 They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach.	49	3	1
593	 Wheat, barley, apples. We've had a blessed harvest.	49	3	1
594	 And, of course, it's our duty to assist the capital	49	3	1
595	 in time of need.	49	3	1
596	 Well, as Ser Loras said,	49	3	1
597	 Lady Margaery has done this sort of...	49	3	1
598	 charitable work before.	49	3	1
599	 I'm sure she knows what she's doing.	49	3	1
600	 I'm sure she does.	49	3	1
601	 The Unsullied have stood here for a day and a night	50	3	1
602	 with no food or water.	50	3	1
603	 They will stand until they drop.	50	3	1
604	 Such is their obedience.	50	3	1
605	 They may suit my needs.	50	3	1
606	 Tell me of their training.	50	3	1
607	 They begin their training at five.	51	3	1
608	 Every day they drill from dawn to dusk	51	3	1
609	 until they have mastered the shortsword,	51	3	1
610	 the shield, and the three spears.	51	3	1
611	 Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training.	51	3	1
612	 Their discipline and loyalty are absolute.	51	3	1
613	 They fear nothing.	51	3	1
614	 Even the bravest men fear death.	51	3	1
615	 My master says the Unsullied are not men.	52	3	1
616	 Death means nothing to them.	52	3	1
617	 He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace.	52	3	1
618	 Tell the good master there is no need.	52	3	1
619	 My master points out that men don't need nipples.	52	3	1
620	 To win his shield,	53	3	1
621	 an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark,	53	3	1
622	 find a newborn and kill it before its mother's eyes.	53	3	1
623	 This way, my master says, we make certain	53	3	1
624	 there is no weakness left in them.	53	3	1
625	 You take a babe from its mother's arms,	53	3	1
626	 kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?	53	3	1
627	 My master would like you to know that the silver is paid	53	3	1
628	 to the baby's owner, not the mother.	53	3	1
629	 How many do you have to sell?	54	3	1
630	 8,000.	54	3	1
631	 Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry.	54	3	1
632	 Many other buyers are interested.	54	3	1
633	 8,000 dead babies.	54	3	1
634	 The Unsullied are a means to an end.	54	3	1
635	 Once I own them, these men--	54	3	1
636	 They're not men. Not anymore.	54	3	1
637	 Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?	54	3	1
638	 Do you think these slaves will have better lives	54	3	1
639	 serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you?	54	3	1
640	 You'll be fair to them.	55	3	1
641	 You won't mutilate them to make a point.	55	3	1
642	 You won't order them to murder babies.	55	3	1
643	 You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered.	55	3	1
644	 A great injustice has been done to them.	55	3	1
645	 Closing your eyes will not undo it.	55	3	1
646	 The warlocks.	56	3	1
647	 I owe you my life, ser.	56	3	1
648	 The honor is mine,	56	3	1
649	 my queen.	56	3	1
650	 You know this man?	56	3	1
651	 I know him	57	3	1
652	 as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen	57	3	1
653	 and as the Lord Commander	57	3	1
654	 of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard.	57	3	1
655	 King Robert is dead.	57	3	1
656	 I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn,	57	3	1
657	 to ask your forgiveness.	57	3	1
658	 I was sworn to protect your family.	57	3	1
659	 I failed them.	57	3	1
660	 I am Barristan Selmy,	57	3	1
661	 Kingsguard to your father.	57	3	1
662	 Allow me to join your Queensguard	57	3	1
663	 and I will not fail you again.	57	3	1
0	 - We shouldn't be out here alone. - Why not?	5	5	1
1	 - If your father-- - He'll never know we're gone.	5	5	1
2	 But if he finds out...	5	5	1
3	 You don't need to be afraid of my father.	5	5	1
4	 Are you sure?	5	5	1
5	 Yes.	5	5	1
6	 - We shouldn't go in. - Of course we should.	5	5	1
7	 Get out. Get out!	6	5	1
8	 - Let's go. - No.	6	5	1
9	 Listen to your friend.	6	5	1
10	 They said that you were terrifying	6	5	1
11	 with cat's teeth and three eyes.	6	5	1
12	 You're not terrifying.	7	5	1
13	 You're boring.	7	5	1
14	 You don't know what I am.	7	5	1
15	 I know you're a witch and you can see the future.	7	5	1
16	 Tell me mine.	7	5	1
17	 Everyone wants to know their future	7	5	1
18	 until they know their future.	7	5	1
19	 This is my father's land. My land.	7	5	1
20	 Tell me my future or I'll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head.	7	5	1
21	 Your blood.	7	5	1
22	 Give me a taste.	7	5	1
23	 Three questions you get.	8	5	1
24	 You won't like the answers.	8	5	1
25	 I've been promised to the prince.	8	5	1
26	 When will we marry?	8	5	1
27	 You will never wed the prince.	8	5	1
28	 You will wed the king.	8	5	1
29	 But I will be queen?	8	5	1
30	 Oh, yes.	8	5	1
31	 You'll be queen.	8	5	1
32	 For a time.	8	5	1
33	 Then comes another,	8	5	1
34	 younger,	8	5	1
35	 more beautiful,	8	5	1
36	 to cast you down and take all you hold dear.	8	5	1
37	 W-will the king and I have children?	9	5	1
38	 No. The king will have 20 children and you will have three.	9	5	1
39	 That doesn't make sense.	9	5	1
40	 Gold will be their crowns.	9	5	1
41	 Gold their shrouds.	9	5	1
42	 Come on, we have to go.	9	5	1
43	 We have to go! Cersei!	9	5	1
44	 Bearers, put it down.	9	5	1
45	 Bearers, up.	9	5	1
46	 Away.	10	5	1
47	 Your Grace, we are honored by your presence.	10	5	1
48	 The mourners are waiting.	10	5	1
49	 They will keep waiting.	10	5	1
50	 I want a moment alone with him.	10	5	1
51	 But, Your Grace, many of these lords and ladies have travelled	10	5	1
52	 day and night to be here from all seven kingdoms.	10	5	1
53	 They will wait.	10	5	1
54	 He never wanted you to be a Kingsguard,	11	5	1
55	 but here you are, protecting his dead body.	11	5	1
56	 What he built, it's ours.	11	5	1
57	 He built it for us. He meant it for us.	11	5	1
58	 They're going to try to take it away.	11	5	1
59	 - All of it. - They?	11	5	1
60	 All of them out there, our enemies.	11	5	1
61	 They're waiting in line to make sure he's really dead.	11	5	1
62	 And as soon as they see the stones on his eyes,	11	5	1
63	 they'll set to work on tearing us apart.	11	5	1
64	 They have nothing to do with it.	11	5	1
65	 The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart.	11	5	1
66	 He's the enemy. I've been telling you for years.	11	5	1
67	 You've been defending him for years.	11	5	1
68	 This is exactly what they want.	11	5	1
69	 And now our father is dead	11	5	1
70	 and that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath.	11	5	1
71	 Did you set him free?	12	5	1
72	 Tyrion may be a monster,	12	5	1
73	 but at least he killed our father on purpose.	12	5	1
74	 You killed him by mistake.	12	5	1
75	 With stupidity.	12	5	1
76	 You're a man of action, aren't you?	12	5	1
77	 When it occurs to you to do something, you do it.	12	5	1
78	 Never mind the consequences.	12	5	1
79	 Take a look.	12	5	1
80	 Look at the consequences.	12	5	1
81	 Here they are.	12	5	1
82	 He loved you more than anyone in this world.	12	5	1
83	 Apologies.	14	5	1
84	 I still don't see why I had to stay	14	5	1
85	 in this fucking crate once we set sail.	14	5	1
86	 I saved your life.	14	5	1
87	 If they catch you, they catch me.	15	5	1
88	 I cannot say I feel overly guilty	15	5	1
89	 about leaving you in that fucking crate.	15	5	1
90	 Do you know what it's like to stuff your shit	15	5	1
91	 through one of those airholes?	15	5	1
92	 No, I only know what it's like	15	5	1
93	 to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.	15	5	1
94	 Pentos?	15	5	1
95	 The home of my colleague Illyrio Mopatis,	15	5	1
96	 a merchant.	15	5	1
97	 He and I met many years ago	15	5	1
98	 through mutual friends.	15	5	1
99	 A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon	15	5	1
100	 for the disaster he was.	15	5	1
101	 We tried to do what was best for the realm	15	5	1
102	 by supporting a Targaryen restoration.	15	5	1
103	 And thus began the chain of mistakes	15	5	1
104	 that has led us both here.	15	5	1
105	 Things have gotten worse, not better.	15	5	1
106	 Westeros needs to be saved from itself.	15	5	1
107	 Mmm.	16	5	1
108	 Much better.	16	5	1
109	 My lord?	16	5	1
110	 I don't think I am anymore.	16	5	1
111	 A lord.	16	5	1
112	 Are you a lord if you kill your father?	16	5	1
113	 I don't imagine they revoke your nobility	16	5	1
114	 for killing a whore.	16	5	1
115	 It must happen all the time.	16	5	1
116	 You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea.	16	5	1
117	 In a box. Why stop now?	16	5	1
118	 Because we are talking about the future of our country.	16	5	1
119	 The future is shit.	16	5	1
120	 Just like the past.	17	5	1
121	 _	19	5	1
122	 _	19	5	1
123	 _	19	5	1
124	 _	19	5	1
125	 _	19	5	1
126	 Shh.	19	5	1
127	 Shh.	19	5	1
128	 The Sons of the Harpy?	20	5	1
129	 Yes, Your Grace. They left it on the body.	20	5	1
130	 They've never killed before.	20	5	1
131	 It was only a matter of time, Your Grace.	20	5	1
132	 Conquerors always meet with resistance.	20	5	1
133	 I didn't conquer them. Their own people did.	20	5	1
134	 _	20	5	1
135	 _	21	5	1
136	 He did not risk his life fighting for his freedom	21	5	1
137	 so cowards in masks could take it away.	21	5	1
138	 And I did not take up residence in this pyramid	21	5	1
139	 so I could watch the city below decline into chaos.	21	5	1
140	 What was the name of the man you lost?	21	5	1
141	 White Rat, Your Grace.	21	5	1
142	 I want him buried with honor, publically	21	5	1
143	 in the Temple of the Graces.	21	5	1
144	 The Sons of the Harpy will hear that message.	21	5	1
145	 Make them very angry.	21	5	1
146	 Angry snakes lash out.	21	5	1
147	 Makes chopping off their heads that much easier.	21	5	1
148	 Find the men who did this and bring them to me.	21	5	1
149	 Your Grace.	21	5	1
150	 Torgo Nudho.	22	5	1
151	 Missandei hin Naath.	22	5	1
152	 I wanted to speak with you.	22	5	1
153	 Why do you come?	22	5	1
154	 White Rat, the Unsullied who...	22	5	1
155	 I have heard they found his body in a brothel.	22	5	1
156	 I have heard that more than one Unsullied	22	5	1
157	 has been known to visit Meereen's brothels.	22	5	1
158	 May I ask you why?	22	5	1
159	 Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?	22	5	1
160	 I do not know.	23	5	1
161	 I must go.	23	5	1
162	 - Get your shield up. - It's too heavy.	23	5	1
163	 If it wasn't heavy, it wouldn't stop a sword.	23	5	1
164	 Now get it up.	23	5	1
165	 Come. Try it again.	23	5	1
166	 Drive at me. Keep your shield up.	23	5	1
167	 Or I'll ring your head like a bell.	23	5	1
168	 Shouldn't you be training, too?	23	5	1
169	 Well, I'm hardly a new recruit.	23	5	1
170	 How many brothers can say that they've killed a white walker and a Thenn?	24	5	1
171	 I might be the first in history.	24	5	1
172	 - Shield up. - These men need a firm hand.	24	5	1
173	 Always have.	24	5	1
174	 They're poachers and thieves.	24	5	1
175	 Not soldiers.	24	5	1
176	 That one hates me.	24	5	1
177	 If Ser Alliser is chosen as the new Lord Commander...	24	5	1
178	 He hates the wildlings.	24	5	1
179	 All the wildlings.	24	5	1
180	 - Don't let them send us away. -  It's not a sure thing.	24	5	1
181	 Ser Denys Mallister has commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years	24	5	1
182	 and people say he's a good man.	24	5	1
183	 He's running against Ser Alliser--	24	5	1
184	 Sam, don't let them send us away.	24	5	1
185	 I told you.	24	5	1
186	 Wherever you go, I go, too.	24	5	1
187	 You can't leave. They'll execute you.	25	5	1
188	 - Good, good, pivot. Don't forget to pivot. - Yah!	25	5	1
189	 Shield up.	25	5	1
190	 The king wants a word.	25	5	1
191	 You're not cold, my lady?	25	5	1
192	 Never.	25	5	1
193	 The Lord's fire lives within me, Jon Snow.	26	5	1
194	 Feel.	26	5	1
195	 Are you a virgin?	26	5	1
196	 No.	26	5	1
197	 Good.	26	5	1
198	 Your Grace.	26	5	1
199	 The bastard of Winterfell.	26	5	1
200	 You know who rules at Winterfell now?	26	5	1
201	 Roose Bolton.	26	5	1
202	 Mmm, the traitor who plunged a dagger in Robb Stark's heart.	26	5	1
203	 Don't you want to avenge him?	27	5	1
204	 I want a great many things, Your Grace.	27	5	1
205	 But I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch now.	27	5	1
206	 I've been talking to your sworn brothers.	27	5	1
207	 - Many of them love you. - They're good men.	27	5	1
208	 Many don't.	27	5	1
209	 You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall.	27	5	1
210	 Why?	27	5	1
211	 It's where she belonged.	27	5	1
212	 Some of the Night's Watch feel you have	27	5	1
213	 too much affection for the wildlings.	27	5	1
214	 They were born on the wrong side of the Wall.	27	5	1
215	 That doesn't make them monsters.	27	5	1
216	 No matter.	27	5	1
217	 I shall take back the North	27	5	1
218	 from the thieves who stole it.	27	5	1
219	 Tywin Lannister is dead. He can't protect them now.	27	5	1
220	 I shall mount Roose Bolton's head on a spike.	27	5	1
221	 But if I'm to take Winterfell, I need more men.	27	5	1
222	 The men of the Night's Watch are sworn to play no part--	27	5	1
223	 I'm not talking about the damn Night's Watch.	27	5	1
224	 I'm talking about the wildlings.	28	5	1
225	 Your Grace, you want the wildlings	28	5	1
226	 to march in your army?	28	5	1
227	 If they swear to follow me, I'll pardon them.	28	5	1
228	 We'll take Winterfell. Once the North is won,	28	5	1
229	 I'll declare them citizens of the realm.	28	5	1
230	 I'll give them land to live on.	28	5	1
231	 It's a fair offer. More than fair.	28	5	1
232	 I'll offer them their lives and their freedom	28	5	1
233	 if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty.	28	5	1
234	 I don't think that's likely.	28	5	1
235	 You admire him, don't you?	28	5	1
236	 - I respect him. - He likes you.	28	5	1
237	 - Convince him to bend the knee... - Your Grace.	28	5	1
238	 ...or he burns.	28	5	1
239	 How much time do I have?	28	5	1
240	 Nightfall.	28	5	1
241	 The sun drops fast this time of year.	29	5	1
242	 Hurry, Jon Snow.	29	5	1
243	 Shield up.	29	5	1
244	 Attack, my lord!	29	5	1
245	 Attack!	29	5	1
246	 Don't cross your feet.	29	5	1
247	 My sons had swords in their hands	29	5	1
248	 from the time they could walk. This one...	29	5	1
249	 Lord Arryn will never be a great warrior.	29	5	1
250	 Great warrior?	29	5	1
251	 He swings a sword like a girl with palsy.	29	5	1
252	 My lord.	29	5	1
253	 Sword up, my lord!	29	5	1
254	 Some boys develop more slowly.	29	5	1
255	 He's still young.	29	5	1
256	 He's 13. Boys go to war at 13.	29	5	1
257	 - He has other gifts. - Does he?	29	5	1
258	 The gift of a great name.	29	5	1
259	 Sometimes that's all one needs.	30	5	1
260	 Good-bye, Lord Royce, and thank you for all you've done for me.	30	5	1
261	 I have done nothing more than my duty, my lady.	30	5	1
262	 I have no doubt that on my return,	30	5	1
263	 Robin's skills will have improved immeasurably.	30	5	1
264	 He'll be safe here.	30	5	1
265	 As for his skills,	30	5	1
266	 I make no promises.	30	5	1
267	 Will we head north at some point?	30	5	1
268	 He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black.	30	5	1
269	 We're a few days' ride from the Kingsroad.	30	5	1
270	 - But that will take us-- - Us?	30	5	1
271	 The only reason you're here is because Jaime Lannister	31	5	1
272	 told me you weren't safe in the capital.	31	5	1
273	 You're hundreds of miles from King's Landing.	31	5	1
274	 No one knows what you look like.	31	5	1
275	 No one cares. You're safe.	31	5	1
276	 - But I'm your squire. - Do you even know what a squire is?	31	5	1
277	 An attendant to a knight.	31	5	1
278	 I'm not a knight.	31	5	1
279	 That means you're not a squire.	31	5	1
280	 Well, where would I go?	31	5	1
281	 I don't care. I'm not your mother.	31	5	1
282	 You swore to find the Stark girls.	31	5	1
283	 I found Arya. She didn't want my protection.	31	5	1
284	 -  Sansa still might. - Will you shut your mouth?	31	5	1
285	 I didn't ask for your advice.	31	5	1
286	 I don't want anyone following me.	31	5	1
287	 I'm not a leader.	32	5	1
288	 All I ever wanted was to fight for a lord I believed in.	32	5	1
289	 The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.	32	5	1
290	 You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.	32	5	1
291	 I did.	32	5	1
292	 - But we're heading west. - We are.	32	5	1
293	 If he wanted to betray us, he already would have.	32	5	1
294	 Lord Royce might be as honorable as he thinks he is,	32	5	1
295	 but he's not alone in that castle.	32	5	1
296	 Do you trust all those knights and ladies,	32	5	1
297	 stable boys and serving girls?	32	5	1
298	 No, do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us?	32	5	1
299	 No.	32	5	1
300	 But I pay them well	32	5	1
301	 and they've seen what happens to men who disappoint me.	32	5	1
302	 So where are we going?	32	5	1
303	 To a land where you trust everyone?	33	5	1
304	 To a land so far from here,	33	5	1
305	 even Cersei Lannister can't get her hands on you.	33	5	1
306	 It was such a deep, deep shock to us all.	33	5	1
307	 Your father was a--	33	5	1
308	 a force to be reckoned with.	33	5	1
309	 He truly was.	33	5	1
310	 I wouldn't presume to claim	33	5	1
311	 to have known him as such, but--	33	5	1
312	 but just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear	33	5	1
313	 just how formidable a person you were dealing with.	33	5	1
314	 What a-- what a force to be reckoned with.	33	5	1
315	 Thank you so much for your kind words.	33	5	1
316	 Deepest condolences, Your Grace.	34	5	1
317	 This tragedy... I never trusted Varys.	34	5	1
318	 I often warned...	34	5	1
319	 Your Grace.	34	5	1
320	 Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.	34	5	1
321	 My deepest sympathies.	34	5	1
322	 I apologize for my son's appearance.	34	5	1
323	 Uncle, it's quite all right.	34	5	1
324	 They call themselves sparrows.	34	5	1
325	 Bloody fanatics.	34	5	1
326	 Religion has its place, of course,	34	5	1
327	 but at a certain point...	34	5	1
328	 They never would have come to the capital when Tywin was alive.	34	5	1
329	 I'm sure he'll grow out of it,	34	5	1
330	 whatever it is.	34	5	1
331	 - Excuse me. - Of course.	34	5	1
332	 Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.	35	5	1
333	 It wasn't my wounds that needed healing.	35	5	1
334	 What can I do for you?	35	5	1
335	 You can forgive me.	35	5	1
336	 What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?	35	5	1
337	 I led you into the darkness.	35	5	1
338	 I doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere.	35	5	1
339	 I tempted you into our...	35	5	1
340	 unnatural relations.	35	5	1
341	 And, of course, there was the king...	35	5	1
342	 his boar hunt.	35	5	1
343	 His wine.	35	5	1
344	 I don't know what you're talking about.	36	5	1
345	 I'm a different person now.	36	5	1
346	 I've found peace in the light of the Seven.	36	5	1
347	 You can, too.	36	5	1
348	 They watch over all of us,	36	5	1
349	 ready to dole out mercy	36	5	1
350	 or justice.	36	5	1
351	 Their world is at hand.	36	5	1
352	 I will pray for your father's soul.	36	5	1
353	 The day Tywin Lannister's soul needs your help...	36	5	1
354	 - It looks like Dorne. - It doesn't.	36	5	1
355	 It does.	36	5	1
356	 That's the-- that's the Sunspear bit right there.	36	5	1
357	 And that's where the mountains are.	37	5	1
358	 And over here is--	37	5	1
359	 is Sunsnake?	37	5	1
360	 Stonespear?	37	5	1
361	 Sandstone.	37	5	1
362	 Yes.	37	5	1
363	 Yes, Sandstone.	37	5	1
364	 Just there.	37	5	1
365	 Fine.	37	5	1
366	 It's Dorne.	37	5	1
367	 We should go there.	37	5	1
368	 I think we would have a lovely time,	37	5	1
369	 judging by my experience.	37	5	1
370	 That would be wonderful. Dorne, Highgarden.	37	5	1
371	 Anywhere but here.	37	5	1
372	 We're late for dinner as it is.	37	5	1
373	 You're very respectful.	38	5	1
374	 I'm very hungry.	38	5	1
375	 What's your name?	38	5	1
376	 Olyvar, my lady.	38	5	1
377	 I'm afraid my brother	38	5	1
378	 is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar.	38	5	1
379	 My lady.	38	5	1
380	 Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet?	39	5	1
381	 Why?	39	5	1
382	 They all know about me anyway.	39	5	1
383	 Everybody knows everything about everyone.	39	5	1
384	 What's the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?	39	5	1
385	 In any event, you shouldn't keep your intended waiting.	39	5	1
386	 My intended? Please.	39	5	1
387	 Tywin's dead.	39	5	1
388	 That means no one can force Cersei to marry me.	39	5	1
389	 - Lucky you. - Unlucky you.	39	5	1
390	 You think I want that woman married to my brother?	39	5	1
391	 If she doesn't marry me, she doesn't go to Highgarden.	39	5	1
392	 Which means she stays in King's Landing.	39	5	1
393	 Which means you're trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your mother by law.	39	5	1
394	 Perhaps.	39	5	1
395	 Perhaps?	39	5	1
396	 Perhaps.	39	5	1
397	 Eunuch, the Spider, the Master of Whisperers.	40	5	1
398	 Imp, Half-man.	40	5	1
399	 There are faster ways to kill yourself.	40	5	1
400	 Not for a coward.	40	5	1
401	 You are many things, my friend,	40	5	1
402	 but not a coward.	40	5	1
403	 You never told me why you set me free.	40	5	1
404	 Your brother asked me to.	40	5	1
405	 Could have said no.	40	5	1
406	 Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.	40	5	1
407	 Not as dangerous as releasing me.	40	5	1
408	 You risked your life, your position, everything.	40	5	1
409	 Why? You're not family. You owe me nothing.	40	5	1
410	 I didn't do it for you.	40	5	1
411	 I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.	40	5	1
412	 A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.	41	5	1
413	 I don't believe in saviors.	41	5	1
414	 I believe men of talent have a part to play in the war to come.	41	5	1
415	 You're going to have to find another soldier.	41	5	1
416	 I'm done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.	41	5	1
417	 You have many admirable qualities,	41	5	1
418	 self-pity is not one of them.	41	5	1
419	 Any fool with a bit of luck	41	5	1
420	 can find himself born into power.	41	5	1
421	 But earning it for yourself, that takes work.	41	5	1
422	 I'm not well-suited for work.	41	5	1
423	 I think you are.	41	5	1
424	 You have your father's instincts for politics.	41	5	1
425	 And you have compassion.	41	5	1
426	 Compassion? Yes.	41	5	1
427	 I killed my lover with my bare hands.	41	5	1
428	 I shot my own father with a crossbow.	41	5	1
429	 I never said you were perfect.	41	5	1
430	 What is it you want exactly?	41	5	1
431	 Peace.	42	5	1
432	 Prosperity.	42	5	1
433	 A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.	42	5	1
434	 Where the castles are made of gingerbread	42	5	1
435	 and the moats are filled with blackberry wine.	42	5	1
436	 The powerful have always preyed on the powerless.	42	5	1
437	 That's how they became powerful in the first place.	42	5	1
438	 Perhaps.	42	5	1
439	 And perhaps we've grown so used to horror,	42	5	1
440	 we assume there's no other way.	42	5	1
441	 If you sat on the Iron Throne,	42	5	1
442	 would you spread misery throughout the land?	42	5	1
443	 I will never sit on the Iron Throne.	42	5	1
444	 No, you won't.	42	5	1
445	 But you could help another climb those steps	42	5	1
446	 and take that seat.	42	5	1
447	 The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen,	42	5	1
448	 but gentler than Stannis.	42	5	1
449	 A monarch who can intimidate the high lords and inspire the people.	42	5	1
450	 A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army	42	5	1
451	 and the right family name.	43	5	1
452	 Good luck finding him.	43	5	1
453	" Who said anything about ""him""?"	43	5	1
454	 You have a choice, my friend.	43	5	1
455	 You can stay here at Illyrio's palace	43	5	1
456	 and drink yourself to death,	43	5	1
457	 or you can ride with me to Meereen,	43	5	1
458	 meet Daenerys Targaryen,	43	5	1
459	 and decide if the world is worth fighting for.	43	5	1
460	 Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?	43	5	1
461	 When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen?	43	5	1
462	 Looks like your friends haven't been behaving themselves.	43	5	1
463	 Our mission to Yunkai was a resounding success.	44	5	1
464	 The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power	44	5	1
465	 to a council of elders made up of both	44	5	1
466	 the freed men and the former slaveholders.	44	5	1
467	 All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review.	44	5	1
468	 Good.	44	5	1
469	 They did ask for some concessions.	44	5	1
470	 Concessions?	44	5	1
471	 Politics is the art of compromise, Your Grace.	44	5	1
472	 I'm not a politician. I'm a queen.	44	5	1
473	 Forgive me. You're right, of course.	44	5	1
474	 Still, it's easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones.	44	5	1
475	 I don't expect the Wise Masters to be happy.	44	5	1
476	 Slavery made them rich. I ended slavery.	44	5	1
477	 They do not ask for the return of slavery.	44	5	1
478	 They ask for the reopening of the fighting pits.	44	5	1
479	 The fighting pits?	44	5	1
480	 Where slaves fought slaves to the death?	44	5	1
481	 In the new world that you've brought to us,	44	5	1
482	 free men would fight free men.	44	5	1
483	 The pit fighters you liberated	45	5	1
484	 plead for this opportunity.	45	5	1
485	 Bring some here and ask them yourself.	45	5	1
486	 No fighting pits.	45	5	1
487	 Opening them would show the people of Yunkai	45	5	1
488	 and Meereen that you respect their traditions.	45	5	1
489	 I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.	45	5	1
490	 - If you-- - How many times must I say no before you understand?	45	5	1
491	 Whatever he wants from me, he's not going to get it.	45	5	1
492	 If he really believes I'm going to reopen the fighting pits...	45	5	1
493	 You should reopen the fighting pits.	45	5	1
494	 What?	45	5	1
495	 My mother was a whore. I told you that.	45	5	1
496	 She liked to drink pear brandy.	45	5	1
497	 The older she got, the less she made selling her body,	45	5	1
498	 the more she wanted to drink.	45	5	1
499	 So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver	45	5	1
500	 she fucked the night before.	45	5	1
501	 I'm sorry.	46	5	1
502	 Why? I was a bad child.	46	5	1
503	 I wasn't big, but I was quick.	46	5	1
504	 And I loved to fight.	46	5	1
505	 So they sold me to a man in Tolos	46	5	1
506	 who trained fighters for the pits.	46	5	1
507	 I had my first match when I was 16.	46	5	1
508	 You were sold into slavery,	46	5	1
509	 forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters,	46	5	1
510	 and you're defending the fighting pits?	46	5	1
511	 I'm only here because of those pits.	46	5	1
512	 I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer,	46	5	1
513	 a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight.	46	5	1
514	 Soon I was famous.	46	5	1
515	 10,000 men and women screamed my name	46	5	1
516	 when I stepped into the pit.	46	5	1
517	 I made so much money for my master,	46	5	1
518	 he set me free when he died.	46	5	1
519	 I joined the Second Sons.	46	5	1
520	 And then I met you.	46	5	1
521	 You're the queen.	47	5	1
522	 Everyone's too afraid of you to speak truth.	47	5	1
523	 Everyone but me.	47	5	1
524	 You've made thousands of enemies all across the world.	47	5	1
525	 As soon as they see weakness,	47	5	1
526	 they'll attack.	47	5	1
527	 Show your strength here, now.	47	5	1
528	 That's why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.	47	5	1
529	 Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied.	47	5	1
530	 You're not the Mother of Unsullied.	47	5	1
531	 You're the Mother of Dragons.	47	5	1
532	 I don't want another child's bones dropped at my feet.	47	5	1
533	 No one's seen Drogon in weeks.	47	5	1
534	 For all I know, he's flown halfway across the world.	47	5	1
535	 I can't control them anymore.	48	5	1
536	 A dragon queen with no dragons	48	5	1
537	 is not a queen.	48	5	1
538	 Viserion?	49	5	1
539	 Rhaegal?	49	5	1
540	 Easy. Easy.	49	5	1
541	 Easy.	49	5	1
542	 So here we are.	50	5	1
543	 Here we are.	50	5	1
544	 When we first met, you were my prisoner.	50	5	1
545	 And now, for our last meeting...	50	5	1
546	 This doesn't have to be our last meeting.	50	5	1
547	 No, but it will be.	51	5	1
548	 You know what Stannis wants?	51	5	1
549	 He wants me to bend the knee.	51	5	1
550	 And he wants the free folk to fight for him.	51	5	1
551	 I'll give him this much,	51	5	1
552	 he's bold.	51	5	1
553	 Shouldn't a king be bold?	51	5	1
554	 Oh, aye.	51	5	1
555	 I respect him.	51	5	1
556	 If he gets what he wants,	51	5	1
557	 I expect he'll be a better ruler than the fools	51	5	1
558	 sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years.	51	5	1
559	 But I'll never serve him.	51	5	1
560	 You told me you weren't here to conquer.	51	5	1
561	 You told me your people have bled enough.	51	5	1
562	 That's right.	51	5	1
563	 I don't want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.	51	5	1
564	 You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together	51	5	1
565	 for the first time in history.	51	5	1
566	 Thenns and Hornfoots,	51	5	1
567	 the ice-river clans, even the giants.	52	5	1
568	 A life's work uniting them. You didn't do it for power.	52	5	1
569	 You didn't do it for glory.	52	5	1
570	 You brought them together to save them	52	5	1
571	 because none of them will survive the winter,	52	5	1
572	 not if they're north of the Wall.	52	5	1
573	 Isn't their survival more important than your pride?	52	5	1
574	 Pride?	52	5	1
575	 Fuck my pride.	52	5	1
576	 This isn't about that.	52	5	1
577	 Then bend the knee and save your people.	52	5	1
578	 They followed me because they respected me.	52	5	1
579	 Because they believed in me.	52	5	1
580	 The moment I kneel for a southern king, that's all gone.	52	5	1
581	 And how many tens of thousands are out there right now?	52	5	1
582	 How many women? How many children?	52	5	1
583	 And you won't go out and rescue them because why?	52	5	1
584	 You're afraid of looking afraid.	52	5	1
585	 Oh, I am afraid.	53	5	1
586	 No shame in that.	53	5	1
587	 How will they do it? Beheading?	53	5	1
588	 Hanging?	53	5	1
589	 They'll burn you alive.	53	5	1
590	 Bad way to go.	53	5	1
591	 I'll be honest with you.	53	5	1
592	 I don't want to die.	53	5	1
593	 And burnt to death,	53	5	1
594	 I don't want people to remember me like that,	53	5	1
595	 scorched and screaming.	53	5	1
596	 But it's better than betraying	53	5	1
597	 everything I believe.	53	5	1
598	 And what happens to your people?	54	5	1
599	 You preserve your dignity and die standing	54	5	1
600	 and they'll sing songs about you.	54	5	1
601	 You'd rather burn than kneel.	54	5	1
602	 The great hero.	54	5	1
603	 Until winter comes and the white walkers come for us all	54	5	1
604	 and there's no one left to sing.	54	5	1
605	 You're a good lad.	54	5	1
606	 Truly you are.	54	5	1
607	 But if you can't understand why I won't enlist my people	54	5	1
608	 in a foreigner's war,	54	5	1
609	 there's no point explaining.	54	5	1
610	 I think you're making a terrible mistake.	55	5	1
611	 The freedom to make my own mistakes	55	5	1
612	 was all I ever wanted.	55	5	1
613	 Mance Rayder, you've been called the King-beyond-the-Wall.	56	5	1
614	 Westeros only has one king.	56	5	1
615	 Bend the knee, I promise you mercy.	56	5	1
616	 Kneel and live.	56	5	1
617	 This was my home for many years.	57	5	1
618	 I wish you good fortune	57	5	1
619	 in the wars to come.	57	5	1
620	 We all must choose.	58	5	1
621	 Man or woman, young or old,	58	5	1
622	 lord or peasant, our choices are the same.	58	5	1
623	 We choose light or we choose darkness.	58	5	1
624	 We choose good or we choose evil.	58	5	1
625	 We choose the true god or the false.	58	5	1
626	 Free folk,	58	5	1
627	 there is only one true king	58	5	1
628	 and his name is Stannis.	58	5	1
629	 Here stands your king of lies.	58	5	1
630	 Behold the fate of those who choose the darkness.	58	5	1

26	 I'm not your lady. I'm your whore.	1	3	8

28	 You are mad. We have powerful friends.	1	3	8
29	 Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you.	1	3	8
30	 Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well.	1	3	8
31	 ( screeching )	1	3	8
32	 He said he had powerful friends.	1	3	8
33	 Who was he talking about?	1	3	8
34	 - I don't know. - Find out.	1	3	8
35	 Haven't you ever wondered where your strength came from?	1	3	8
36	 - Your blood is noble. - I'm just a bastard.	1	3	8
37	 The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon.	1	3	8
38	 There is power in a king's blood.	1	3	8
39	 You're a liar!	1	3	8
40	 You lied to Gendry, you lied to me.	1	3	8
41	 Now--	1	3	8
42	 - Anguy, bring her back. -  Come back, girl!	1	3	8
43	 Kick all you like, wolf girl.	1	3	8

51	 Go on, hit me.	4	3	8
52	 Hit me hard.	4	3	8
53	 Sulk all you want.	4	3	8
54	 The truth is, you're lucky.	5	3	8
55	 You don't want to be alone out here, girl.	5	3	8
56	 Someone worse than me would find you.	5	3	8
57	 There's no one worse than you.	5	3	8
58	 Ha, you never knew my brother.	5	3	8
59	 He once killed a man for snoring.	5	3	8
60	 There's plenty worse than me.	5	3	8
61	 There's men who like to beat little girls,	5	3	8
62	 men who like to rape them.	5	3	8
63	 I saved your sister from some of them.	5	3	8
64	 You're lying.	5	3	8
65	 Ask her, if you ever see her again.	5	3	8
66	 Ask her who came back for her	5	3	8
67	 when the mob had her on her back.	5	3	8
68	 They would have taken her every which way	5	3	8
69	 and left her there with her throat cut open.	5	3	8
70	 Is that the Blackwater?	5	3	8
71	 The Blackwater?	5	3	8
72	 Where do you think I'm taking you?	5	3	8
73	 Back to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen.	5	3	8
74	 Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the queen.	6	3	8
75	 That's the Red Fork.	6	3	8
76	 I'm taking you to the Twins.	6	3	8
77	 But why?	6	3	8
78	 Because your mother and brother will be there	6	3	8
79	 and they'll pay me for you.	6	3	8
80	 Why would they be at the Twins?	6	3	8
81	 ( chuckles ) Those outlaws you love so much never told you?	6	3	8
82	 The whole countryside is yapping about it.	6	3	8
83	 Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls.	6	3	8
84	 So quit trying to bash my skull in	6	3	8
85	 and we might just make it there in time for the wedding.	6	3	8

87	 Men who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty.	6	3	8
88	 They cannot be trusted.	7	3	8
89	  They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid.	7	3	8
90	 The Yunkish are paying them well.	7	3	8
91	 You know these men?	7	3	8
92	 Only by the broken swords on their banners.	7	3	8
93	 They're called the Second Sons.	7	3	8
94	 A company led by a Braavosi named Mero,	7	3	8
95	" ""The Titan's Bastard."""	7	3	8
96	 Is he more titan or bastard?	7	3	8
97	 He's a dangerous man, khaleesi.	7	3	8
98	 They all are.	7	3	8
99	 How many?	7	3	8
100	  2,000, Your Grace.	7	3	8
101	 Armored and mounted.	7	3	8
102	 Enough to make a difference?	7	3	8
103	 It's hard to collect wages from a corpse.	7	3	8
104	 I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.	7	3	8
105	 I imagine you're right.	7	3	8
106	 I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.	7	3	8
107	 He may not agree to meet.	7	3	8
108	 He will.	7	3	8
109	 A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.	8	3	8
110	  Your Grace, allow me to present	8	3	8
111	 the captains of the Second Sons--	8	3	8
112	 Mero of Braavos,	8	3	8
113	 Prendahl na Ghezn,	8	3	8
114	 and...	8	3	8
115	 Daario Naharis.	8	3	8
116	 You are the Mother of Dragons?	8	3	8
117	 I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys.	8	3	8
118	 - Mind your tongue. -  Why?	8	3	8
119	 I didn't mind hers.	8	3	8
120	 She licked my ass like she was born to do it.	8	3	8
121	 ( laughs )	8	3	8
122	 You, slave girl, bring wine.	8	3	8
123	 We have no slaves here.	8	3	8
124	 You'll all be slaves after the battle	8	3	8
125	 unless I save you.	8	3	8
126	 Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero's lap	8	3	8
127	 and I may give you my Second Sons.	8	3	8
128	 Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded.	9	3	8
129	 Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?	9	3	8
130	 Under 2,000, Your Grace.	9	3	8
131	 We have more, don't we?	9	3	8
132	  10,000 Unsullied.	9	3	8
133	 I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war,	9	3	8
134	 but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself	9	3	8
135	 can explain to me how you propose to defeat us.	9	3	8
136	 I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie.	9	3	8
137	 You have 8,000 Unsullied.	9	3	8
138	 You're very young to be a captain.	9	3	8
139	 He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant.	9	3	8
140	 Even if your numbers are right,	9	3	8
141	 you must admit the odds don't favor your side.	9	3	8
142	 The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won.	9	3	8
143	 The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.	9	3	8
144	 Or you could fight for me.	9	3	8
145	 ( Mero laughs )	9	3	8
146	 We've taken the slavers' gold.	9	3	8
147	 We fight for Yunkai.	9	3	8
148	 -  I would pay you as much and more. - ( sniffs )	9	3	8
149	 Our contract is our bond.	10	3	8
150	 If we break our bond,	10	3	8
151	 no one will hire the Second Sons again.	10	3	8
152	 Ride with me and you'll never need another contract.	10	3	8
153	 You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing	10	3	8
154	 when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.	10	3	8
155	 You have no ships. You have no siege weapons.	10	3	8
156	 You have no cavalry.	10	3	8
157	 A fortnight ago, I had no army.	10	3	8
158	 A year ago, I had no dragons.	10	3	8
159	 You have two days to decide.	10	3	8
160	 Show me your cunt. I want to see if it's worth fighting for.	10	3	8
161	 _	10	3	8
162	 _	10	3	8
163	 You seem to be enjoying my wine.	10	3	8
164	 Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder.	10	3	8
165	 Only a flagon?	10	3	8
166	 And what are my brothers in arms to drink?	10	3	8
167	 - A barrel, then. - Good.	10	3	8
168	 The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone.	10	3	8
169	 In the Second Sons, we share everything.	11	3	8
170	 After the battle, maybe we'll all share you.	11	3	8
171	 I'll come looking for you when this is over.	11	3	8
172	 Ser Barristan,	11	3	8
173	 if it comes to battle, kill that one first.	11	3	8
174	 Gladly, Your Grace.	11	3	8
175	 Half Robert, half lowborn.	12	3	8
176	 Show the boy to his chambers.	12	3	8
177	 Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes.	12	3	8
178	 I'll come visit you soon.	12	3	8
179	 What do you mean to do with him?	12	3	8
180	 You know what I mean to do with him.	12	3	8
181	 Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes?	12	3	8
182	 If it needs to be done, do it. Don't torture the boy.	12	3	8
183	 Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?	12	3	8
184	 No.	12	3	8
185	 If the lamb sees the knife,	12	3	8
186	 she panics.	13	3	8
187	 Her panic seeps into her meat,	13	3	8
188	 darkens it, fouls the flavor.	13	3	8
189	 You've slaughtered many lambs?	13	3	8
190	 And none have seen the blade.	13	3	8
191	 ( door closes )	13	3	8
192	"  ""And tho-- and thowg..."	13	3	8
193	 V-v-visenya...	13	3	8
194	 Targaryen...	13	3	8
195	 rod-- rode	13	3	8
196	 Vhagar--	13	3	8
197	" Vhag--"""	13	3	8
198	 Fuck me.	13	3	8

204	 large enog--	14	3	8
205	 enough-- enough	14	3	8
206	" to swallow a horse whole."""	14	3	8
207	 Your Grace.	14	3	8
208	 They feeding you enough?	14	3	8
209	 Two meals a day.	14	3	8
210	 Cold for breakfast, hot for supper.	14	3	8
211	 I cannot complain.	14	3	8
212	 You don't belong in a place like this.	14	3	8
213	 Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse.	14	3	8
214	 Yeah.	14	3	8
215	 I'm sorry about your son.	14	3	8
216	 Didn't get the chance to tell you before.	14	3	8
217	 Good lad. Loyal lad.	14	3	8
218	 Melisandre's returned.	15	3	8
219	 I didn't know she'd been gone.	15	3	8
220	 Came back with a bastard boy.	15	3	8
221	 Robert's bastard boy.	15	3	8
222	 Why?	15	3	8
223	 She says there's power in king's blood.	15	3	8
224	 She's going to kill him.	15	3	8
225	 Sacrifice him.	15	3	8
226	 Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man,	15	3	8
227	 but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice?	15	3	8
228	 The boy is your nephew.	15	3	8
229	 What of it? We're at war.	15	3	8
230	 Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut	15	3	8
231	 Robert bedded one drunken night?	15	3	8
232	 Because he has your blood in his veins.	15	3	8
233	 So did Renly.	15	3	8
234	 Renly wronged you.	15	3	8
235	 Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you.	15	3	8
236	 He raised an army, stole your bannermen.	15	3	8
237	 This boy has done you no harm.	15	3	8
238	 - He's an innocent. - How many boys live in Westeros?	15	3	8
239	 How many girls? How many men? How many women?	15	3	8
240	 The darkness will devour them all, she says.	16	3	8
241	 The night that never ends.	16	3	8
242	 Unless I triumph.	16	3	8
243	 I never asked for this.	16	3	8
244	 No more than I asked to be king.	16	3	8
245	 We do not choose our destiny,	16	3	8
246	 but we must do our duty, no?	16	3	8
247	 Great or small, we must do our duty.	16	3	8
248	 What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?	16	3	8
249	 Your Grace,	16	3	8
250	 why did you come to see me today?	16	3	8
251	 I came to free you.	16	3	8
252	 If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.	16	3	8
253	 I swear it.	16	3	8
254	 I can't swear never to speak against her.	16	3	8
255	 You have little regard for your own life.	16	3	8
256	 Quite little, Your Grace.	16	3	8
257	 Verging on none.	16	3	8
258	 You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow,	16	3	8
259	 but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife	16	3	8
260	 because you knew I'd counsel restraint.	17	3	8
261	 You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself.	17	3	8
262	 You're not a man who slaughters innocents	17	3	8
263	 for gain or glory.	17	3	8
264	 When my son was five he said to me,	17	3	8
265	" ""I don't ever want to die."""	17	3	8
266	" I wanted to say to him, ""You won't, child. You won't ever."""	17	3	8
267	 I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid.	17	3	8
268	 I think mothers and fathers made up the gods	17	3	8
269	 because they wanted their children to sleep through the night.	17	3	8
270	 I saw a vision in the flames.	17	3	8
271	 A great battle in the snow.	17	3	8
272	 I saw it.	17	3	8
273	 And you saw whatever she gave birth to.	17	3	8
274	 I never believed, but when you see the truth,	18	3	8
275	 when it's right there in front of you	18	3	8
276	 as real as these iron bars,	18	3	8
277	 how can you deny her god is real?	18	3	8
278	 - ( horse neighs ) - ( people chatting )	18	3	8
279	 Little dragon bitch. She talks too much.	18	3	8
280	 You talk too much.	18	3	8
281	 She won't talk so much when she's choking on my cock.	18	3	8
282	 8,000 Unsullied stand between her and your cock.	18	3	8
283	 ( laughs ) My cock will find a way.	18	3	8
284	 Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can't reach?	18	3	8
285	 She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.	18	3	8
286	 Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn't like whores.	18	3	8
287	 I like them very much. I just refuse to pay them.	19	3	8
288	 And I'm no whore, my friend.	19	3	8
289	 She sells her sheath and you sell your blade.	19	3	8
290	 - What's the difference? - I fight for beauty.	19	3	8
291	 For beauty?	19	3	8
292	 We fight for gold.	19	3	8
293	 The gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die--	19	3	8
294	 the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked	19	3	8
295	 and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you.	19	3	8
296	 You'll die young.	19	3	8
297	  What do we do about the dragon girl?	19	3	8
298	 We can't beat 8,000 Unsullied on the battlefield.	19	3	8
299	 There won't be a battle. And we don't have to deal with her eunuchs.	19	3	8
300	 We only have to deal with her.	19	3	8
301	 - She's well guarded. -  Tonight's a new moon.	19	3	8
302	 One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights.	19	3	8
303	 Which one of us?	19	3	8
304	 Close your eyes, love.	19	3	8
305	 Three coins.	19	3	8
306	 A coin from Meereen,	20	3	8
307	 a coin from Volantis,	20	3	8
308	 and a coin from Braavos.	20	3	8
309	 The Braavosi does the deed.	20	3	8
310	 One for each of us, darling.	20	3	8
311	 No peeking.	20	3	8
312	 Do you hear me?	20	3	8
313	 Follow my voice. I'm right here.	20	3	8
314	 You have something for me?	20	3	8
315	 Valar morghulis.	20	3	8
316	 ( knock at door )	20	3	8
317	 ( sighs )	21	3	8
318	 Lady Sansa.	21	3	8
319	 You look very handsome, my lord.	21	3	8
320	 Oh, yes.	21	3	8
321	 The husband of your dreams.	21	3	8
322	 But you do look glorious.	21	3	8
323	 Perhaps we could have a moment alone.	21	3	8
324	 Do you mind?	21	3	8
325	 Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?	21	3	8
326	 My lady,	21	3	8
327	 I want you to know	21	3	8
328	 I didn't ask for this.	22	3	8
329	 I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord.	22	3	8
330	 No, don't.	22	3	8
331	 You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore.	22	3	8
332	 You won't be a prisoner after today.	22	3	8
333	 You'll be my wife.	22	3	8
334	 I suppose that's a different kind of prison.	22	3	8
335	 I just wanted to say--	22	3	8
336	 I'm just trying to say very badly--	22	3	8
337	 I just--	22	3	8
338	 just want to say I know how you feel.	22	3	8
339	 I doubt that very much, my lord.	22	3	8
340	 You're right.	22	3	8
341	 I have no idea how you feel.	22	3	8
342	 And you have no idea how I feel.	22	3	8
343	 But I promise you one thing, my lady.	22	3	8
344	 I won't ever hurt you.	23	3	8
345	 Do you drink wine?	23	3	8
346	 When I have to.	23	3	8
347	 Well, today you have to.	23	3	8
348	  You look radiant, Your Grace.	23	3	8
349	 Radiant? Why radiant?	23	3	8
350	 It's the word that came to mind.	23	3	8
351	 ( chuckles )	23	3	8
352	 We're going to be sisters soon.	23	3	8
353	 We should be friends.	23	3	8
354	 You're a musical girl, aren't you?	23	3	8
355	 I imagine you have a lovely voice.	23	3	8
356	 A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid.	23	3	8
357	" Ah, but you know the song ""The Rains of Castamere""?"	23	3	8
358	 Of course. They play it so often here at court.	23	3	8
359	 So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?	23	3	8
360	 Not as well as you, I'm sure.	23	3	8
361	 House Reyne was a powerful family.	24	3	8
362	 Very wealthy.	24	3	8
363	 The second wealthiest in Westeros.	24	3	8
364	 Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?	24	3	8
365	 Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop	24	3	8
366	 on the second highest rung.	24	3	8
367	 If only you could take that final step,	24	3	8
368	 you'd see further than all the rest.	24	3	8
369	 You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you.	24	3	8
370	 So Lord Reyne built a castle	24	3	8
371	 as grand as Casterly Rock.	24	3	8
372	 He gave his wife diamonds	24	3	8
373	 larger than any my mother ever wore.	24	3	8
374	 And finally one day,	24	3	8
375	 he rebelled against my father.	24	3	8
376	 Do you know where House Reyne is now?	24	3	8
377	 Gone.	24	3	8
378	 Gone.	24	3	8
379	 A gentle word.	24	3	8
380	 Why not say slaughtered?	24	3	8
381	 Every man, woman, and child	24	3	8
382	 put to the sword.	24	3	8
383	 I remember seeing their bodies hanging	24	3	8
384	 high above the gates of Casterly Rock.	25	3	8
385	 My father let them rot up there all summer.	25	3	8
386	 It was a long summer.	25	3	8
387	" ""And now the rains weep o'er their halls,"	25	3	8
388	" and not a soul to hear."""	25	3	8
389	 If you ever call me sister again,	25	3	8
390	 I'll have you strangled in your sleep.	25	3	8
391	 ( doors open )	25	3	8
392	 What are you doing?	25	3	8
393	 Your father's gone.	26	3	8
394	 As the father of the realm,	26	3	8
395	 it is my duty to give you away to your husband.	26	3	8
396	 You may now cloak the bride	27	3	8
397	 and bring her under your protection.	27	3	8
398	 ( light laughter )	27	3	8
399	 ( snickers )	28	3	8
400	 ( laughter )	28	3	8
401	 ( laughter stops )	28	3	8
402	 Could you...	28	3	8
403	 Thank you.	28	3	8
404	 Your Grace, Your Grace,	28	3	8
405	 my lords, my ladies,	28	3	8
406	 we stand here in the sight of gods and men	28	3	8
407	 to witness the union of man and wife.	28	3	8
408	 One flesh, one heart, one soul,	28	3	8
409	 now and forever.	28	3	8
410	 Have you ever seen one like it?	29	3	8
411	 I've never seen anything like any of this.	29	3	8
412	 Not in my life.	29	3	8
413	 It's shocking, isn't it,	29	3	8
414	 the first time you encounter real wealth?	29	3	8
415	 When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day.	29	3	8
416	 And stew is a kind word for it.	29	3	8
417	 In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown.	29	3	8
418	 We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken.	29	3	8
419	 We knew it wasn't chicken.	29	3	8
420	 ( liquid pouring )	29	3	8
421	 Here, taste this.	29	3	8
422	 You think I'm trying to poison you?	29	3	8
423	 That's good.	30	3	8
424	 That's really good.	30	3	8
425	 Where do you think it's from?	30	3	8
426	 I couldn't even guess.	30	3	8
427	 Doesn't matter, does it?	30	3	8
428	 It's the real thing or it's not.	30	3	8
429	 You only need a tongue to tell the difference.	30	3	8
430	 Go on, have some more.	30	3	8
431	 You still don't trust it.	30	3	8
432	 You think this is all a mistake	30	3	8
433	 and that you'll have to pay somehow for every bite you take.	30	3	8
434	 That thought had crossed my mind, yeah.	30	3	8
435	 There are no mistakes.	31	3	8
436	 Not for us.	31	3	8
437	 I'm a mistake.	31	3	8
438	 I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother	31	3	8
439	 instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.	31	3	8
440	 Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it.	31	3	8
441	 He willed it so you could be here right now	31	3	8
442	 with a power inside you	31	3	8
443	 you can't even begin to understand.	31	3	8
444	 And He brought me here to draw it from you	31	3	8
445	 and birth it into the world.	31	3	8
446	 We're both a part of His plan.	31	3	8
447	 He wants this for us.	31	3	8
448	 No, He demands this of us.	31	3	8
449	 I don't understand. This--	31	3	8
450	 this doesn't seem very religious.	31	3	8
451	 According to whom?	31	3	8
452	 The Silent Sisters?	31	3	8
453	 With their stern looks,	31	3	8
454	 muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts?	32	3	8
455	 What have their gods done for you?	32	3	8
456	 Hmm?	32	3	8
457	 When you pray to them,	32	3	8
458	 what's their answer?	32	3	8
459	 A god is real or he's not.	32	3	8
460	 You only need eyes to see.	32	3	8
461	 Death is coming for everyone and everything.	32	3	8
462	 A darkness that will swallow the dawn.	32	3	8
463	 And we can stop it, you and I.	32	3	8
464	 ( breathing heavily )	33	3	8
465	 Let me show you what you have inside you.	33	3	8
466	 Come fight death with me.	33	3	8
467	 ( both moaning )	33	3	8
468	 What are you doing?	33	3	8
469	 You have to trust me.	33	3	8
470	 What--?	34	3	8
471	 Get it away.	34	3	8
472	 Get it off me.	34	3	8
473	 Don't fight, don't fight. They won't take much.	34	3	8
474	 Why are you doing this?	34	3	8
475	 I told you there's power in the blood of kings.	34	3	8
476	 And you have so much blood.	34	3	8
477	 No. No, no, no, no!	34	3	8
478	 Not there. Not there!	34	3	8
479	 You can blame Ser Davos.	34	3	8
480	 He didn't believe in the power of king's blood.	34	3	8
481	 He wanted a demonstration.	34	3	8
482	  Please. Please, Your Grace.	34	3	8
483	 My lord!	35	3	8
484	 ( cries out )	35	3	8
485	 The usurper Robb Stark.	35	3	8
486	 The usurper Balon Greyjoy.	35	3	8
487	 The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.	35	3	8
488	 - ( music playing ) - ( people chatting )	36	3	8
489	 So their son will be your nephew.	36	3	8
490	 After you're wed to Cersei, of course.	36	3	8
491	 And you will be the king's stepfather	36	3	8
492	 and brother-in-law.	36	3	8
493	 When you marry the king,	36	3	8
494	 Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law	36	3	8
495	 and your son will be Loras' nephew?	36	3	8
496	 Grandson? I'm not sure.	36	3	8
497	 But your brother will become your father-in-law.	36	3	8
498	 That much is beyond dispute.	36	3	8
499	 ( snorts )	37	3	8
500	 Will you pardon me, my lord?	37	3	8
501	 Of course. Of course. En-- enjoy.	37	3	8
502	 Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead.	37	3	8
503	 I've got a lifetime for that.	37	3	8
504	 Stay.	37	3	8
505	 You seem rather drunk.	37	3	8
506	 Rather less than I plan to be.	37	3	8
507	 Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?	37	3	8
508	  This isn't about your wedding.	38	3	8
509	 Renly Baratheon had a wedding.	38	3	8
510	 Your wife needs a child,	38	3	8
511	 a Lannister child, as soon as possible.	38	3	8
512	 - And? - If you're going to give her one,	38	3	8
513	 you need to perform.	38	3	8
514	 What did you once call me?	38	3	8
515	 A drunken little lust-filled beast.	38	3	8
516	 - More than once. - There you have it.	38	3	8
517	 Nothing to worry about.	38	3	8
518	 Drinking and lust,	38	3	8
519	 no man can match me in these things.	38	3	8
520	 I am the god of tits and wine.	38	3	8
521	 I shall build a shrine to myself	38	3	8
522	 at the next brothel I visit.	38	3	8
523	 You can drink, you can joke,	38	3	8
524	 you can engage in juvenile attempts	38	3	8
525	 to make your father uncomfortable,	38	3	8
526	 but you will do your duty.	38	3	8
527	 Well...	39	3	8
528	 My father once told me--	39	3	8
529	 Nobody cares what your father once told you.	39	3	8
530	 Congratulations, my lady.	40	3	8
531	 Thank you, Your Grace.	40	3	8
532	 Well, you've done it. You've married a Lannister.	40	3	8
533	 Soon you'll have a Lannister baby.	40	3	8
534	 It's a dream come true for you, isn't it?	40	3	8
535	 What a glorious day.	40	3	8
536	 Yes, Your Grace.	40	3	8
537	 I suppose it doesn't really matter	40	3	8
538	 which Lannister puts the baby into you.	40	3	8
539	 Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight	40	3	8
540	 after my uncle passes out.	40	3	8
541	 How'd you like that?	40	3	8
542	 You wouldn't?	40	3	8
543	 That's all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.	40	3	8
544	 ( claps )	40	3	8
545	 Time for the bedding ceremony.	40	3	8
546	 ( cheering )	40	3	8
547	 There will be no bedding ceremony.	40	3	8
548	 Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle?	40	3	8
549	 Come, everyone.	40	3	8
550	 Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed.	41	3	8
551	 Get rid of her gown. She won't be needing it any longer.	41	3	8
552	 Ladies, attend to my uncle. He's not heavy.	41	3	8
553	 There will be no bedding ceremony.	41	3	8
554	 There will be if I command it.	41	3	8
555	 Then you'll be fucking your own bride	41	3	8
556	 with a wooden cock.	41	3	8
557	 What did you say?	41	3	8
558	 What did you say?!	41	3	8
559	 I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace.	41	3	8
560	 I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king.	41	3	8
561	 ( laughs )	41	3	8
562	 A bad joke, Your Grace.	41	3	8
563	 Made out of envy of your own royal manhood.	41	3	8
564	 Mine is so small.	42	3	8
565	 My poor wife won't even know I'm there.	42	3	8
566	 Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace.	42	3	8
567	  I am.	42	3	8
568	 Guilty.	42	3	8
569	 But--	42	3	8
570	 but it is my wedding night.	42	3	8
571	 My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do.	42	3	8
572	 Come, wife.	42	3	8
573	 I vomited on a girl once	42	3	8
574	 in the middle of the act.	42	3	8
575	 Not proud of it.	42	3	8
576	 But I think honesty is important	42	3	8
577	 between a man and wife, don't you agree?	42	3	8
578	 Come, I'll tell you all about it.	42	3	8
579	 Put you in the mood.	42	3	8
580	 Is that wise, my lord?	43	3	8
581	 Tyrion, Sansa.	43	3	8
582	 My name is Tyrion.	43	3	8
583	 Is that wise, Tyrion?	43	3	8
584	 Nothing was ever wiser.	43	3	8
585	 Astoundingly long.	43	3	8
586	 What?	44	3	8
587	 Neck.	44	3	8
588	 You have one.	44	3	8
589	 How old are you exactly?	44	3	8
590	 14.	44	3	8
591	 Well, talk won't make you any older.	44	3	8
592	 My lord father has commanded me	44	3	8
593	 to consummate this marriage.	44	3	8
594	 Stop.	45	3	8
595	 I can't.	46	3	8
596	 I could, I won't.	46	3	8
597	 But your father--	46	3	8
598	 If my father wants someone to get fucked,	46	3	8
599	 I know where he can start.	46	3	8
600	 I won't share your bed.	46	3	8
601	 Not until you want me to.	46	3	8
602	 What if I never want you to?	46	3	8
603	 And so my watch begins.	46	3	8
604	 ( thuds )	47	3	8
605	 - ( horse neighs ) - ( chatter )	47	3	8
606	 19?	47	3	8
607	 Yes, Your Grace.	47	3	8
608	 How can anyone speak 19 languages?	47	3	8
609	 It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.	47	3	8
610	 Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki	47	3	8
611	 or grunt at my husband and hope--	47	3	8
612	 what do you mean reasonably well?	48	3	8
613	 Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master.	48	3	8
614	 So guttural and harsh.	48	3	8
615	 _	48	3	8
616	 _	48	3	8
617	 Athjahakar.	48	3	8
618	 Athjahaka.	48	3	8
619	 Ath-ja-hakar.	48	3	8
620	 Athjahakar.	48	3	8
621	 Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice.	48	3	8
622	 Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace.	48	3	8
623	 The gods could not devise a more perfect tongue.	48	3	8
624	 It is the only proper language for poetry.	48	3	8
625	 ( Missandei gasps )	48	3	8
626	 No screaming or she dies.	48	3	8
627	 What do you want?	49	3	8
628	 You.	49	3	8
629	 Let her go.	49	3	8
630	 Don't scream, lovely girl.	49	3	8
631	 You were sent here to kill me?	49	3	8
632	 ( chuckles )	49	3	8
633	 So why haven't you?	49	3	8
634	 I don't want to.	49	3	8
635	 What do your captains have to say about that?	49	3	8
636	 You should ask them.	49	3	8
637	 Why?	49	3	8
638	 We had philosophical differences.	49	3	8
639	 - Over what? - Your beauty.	49	3	8
640	 It meant more to me than it did to them.	49	3	8
641	 You're a strange man.	49	3	8
642	 I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet.	49	3	8
643	 I only do what I want to do.	50	3	8
644	 And this is supposed to impress me?	50	3	8
645	 Yes.	50	3	8
646	 Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?	50	3	8
647	 They ordered me to murder you.	50	3	8
648	 I told them I preferred not to.	50	3	8
649	 They told me I had no choice.	50	3	8
650	 I told them I am Daario Naharis.	50	3	8
651	 I always have a choice.	50	3	8
652	 They drew their swords	50	3	8
653	 and I drew mine.	50	3	8
654	 Will you fight for me?	51	3	8
655	 Swear to me.	51	3	8
656	 The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis.	51	3	8
657	 My sword is yours, my life is yours,	51	3	8
658	 my heart is yours.	51	3	8
659	 ( door opens )	51	3	8
660	 ( door closes )	51	3	8
661	 You really ought to knock.	51	3	8
662	 I brought your breakfast.	51	3	8
663	 ( door opens, closes )	52	3	8
664	 ( wind howling )	52	3	8
665	 ( baby fusses )	53	3	8
666	 ( cawing )	53	3	8
667	 It's getting dark.	53	3	8
668	 We could stay here for the night.	53	3	8
669	 ( baby fussing )	53	3	8
670	 ( caws )	53	3	8
671	 ( wind howling )	53	3	8
672	 ( stones clacking )	53	3	8
673	 How hard can it be to build a fire?	53	3	8
674	 It doesn't matter.	53	3	8
675	 Come under the furs. We can keep each other warm.	53	3	8
676	 ( baby fusses )	54	3	8
677	 He winked at me before.	54	3	8
678	 - I doubt it. - I saw him wink at me.	54	3	8
679	 He blinked.	54	3	8
680	 I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference	54	3	8
681	 between a wink and a blink.	54	3	8
682	 A what?	54	3	8
683	 Well, I mean, there's no real difference.	54	3	8
684	 A wink is on purpose.	54	3	8
685	 You thought of a name yet?	54	3	8
686	 It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.	54	3	8
687	 Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?	55	3	8
688	 What? No.	55	3	8
689	 This is just the way I talk.	55	3	8
690	 I'll build that fire.	55	3	8
691	 Don't you think he should have a name?	55	3	8
692	 I don't know many boys' names.	55	3	8
693	 Let's see,	55	3	8
694	 there's Duncan,	55	3	8
695	 - Kevan, Jon... - ( stones clacking )	55	3	8
696	 Guymon,	55	3	8
697	 Feldan, Tristifer.	55	3	8
698	 Craster.	55	3	8
699	 Uh, yes.	55	3	8
700	 Maybe that's not--	55	3	8
701	 Mormont.	55	3	8
702	 That's a lovely idea,	55	3	8
703	 but Mormont's a last name.	55	3	8
704	 Why is it a last name?	56	3	8
705	 Well, it's a family name.	56	3	8
706	 For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly.	56	3	8
707	 Samwell is my birth name	56	3	8
708	 and Tarly is my family name.	56	3	8
709	 You see? So my father is also a Tarly.	56	3	8
710	 His name is Samwell Tarly, too?	56	3	8
711	 No, Randyll Tarly.	56	3	8
712	 Randyll is a handsome name.	56	3	8
713	 Please don't name him Randyll.	56	3	8
714	 Is your father cruel like mine?	56	3	8
715	 ( crows cawing )	56	3	8
716	 Different manner of cruel.	56	3	8
717	 Not Randyll, then.	57	3	8
718	 ( crows cawing loudly )	57	3	8
719	 Don't.	57	3	8
720	 Don't go out there.	57	3	8
721	 I'll be back.	57	3	8
722	 I just want to look.	57	3	8
723	 ( loud cawing continues )	57	3	8
724	 Go inside.	58	3	8
725	 Go back inside. I'll--	58	3	8
726	 - ( screeching ) - ( cawing stops )	58	3	8
727	 ( chittering )	58	3	8
728	 It's come for the baby.	58	3	8
729	 Stay back!	58	3	8
730	 You stay back!	59	3	8
731	 ( baby crying )	59	3	8
732	 No, you can't have him! No!	59	3	8
733	 No!	59	3	8
734	 - ( shouting ) - ( screams )	59	3	8
735	 ( roaring )	59	3	8
736	 ( screeching )	59	3	8
737	 ( crows cawing )	59	3	8
738	 ( both panting )	59	3	8
739	 ( cawing )	59	3	8
0	 You think I can't hear you every day talking about visions	0	3	9
1	 and three-eyed ravens and black magic?	0	3	9
2	 I don't want you talking to him till we get to Castle Black.	0	3	9
3	 We're not going to Castle Black. Jon Snow isn't there.	0	3	9
4	 Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.	0	3	9
5	 Oh, no, I'm not going back there.	0	3	9
6	 I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further.	0	3	9
7	 You won't win. You don't have the discipline.	0	3	9
8	 - You don't know how to fight together. - You don't know that.	0	3	9
9	 If you attack the Wall you'll die, all of you.	0	3	9
10	 All of us.	0	3	9
11	 I can't force them to meet us in the field.	0	3	9
12	 - Casterly Rock can't run away. - Can you do it?	0	3	9
13	 There is only one person in this kingdom	0	3	9
14	 with that kind of army. Walder Frey.	0	3	9
15	 We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.	0	3	9
16	 Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters.	0	3	9
17	 - You were sent here to kill me? - I don't want to.	0	3	9
18	 What do your captains have to say about that?	0	3	9
19	 You should ask them.	0	3	9
20	 Will you fight for me?	0	3	9
21	 The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis.	1	3	9
22	 My sword is yours, my life is yours,	1	3	9
23	 my heart is yours.	1	3	9
24	 - Is that the Blackwater? - Where do you think I'm taking you?	1	3	9
25	 - Back to King's Landing. - That's the Red Fork.	1	3	9
26	 I'm taking you to the Twins.	1	3	9
27	 Your uncle's marrying one of the Frey girls.	1	3	9
28	 Your mother and brother will be there	1	3	9
29	 and they'll pay me for you.	1	3	9
30	 That rain will cost us another day.	1	3	9
31	 Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.	1	3	9
32	 - He's getting the wedding he wanted. - He's getting a wedding.	1	3	9
33	 It was a king he wanted.	1	3	9
34	 It's come for the baby.	1	3	9
35	 You stay back!	1	3	9
36	 No, you can't have him.	1	3	9
37	 No!	1	3	9
38		3	3	9
39	 Are you sure about this?	4	3	9
40	 No.	4	3	9
41	 It's dangerous.	4	3	9
42	 If we take Tywin's castle from him,	4	3	9
43	 the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible.	4	3	9
44	 Take his home,	4	3	9
45	 take his gold, take his power.	4	3	9
46	 Why are you telling me?	4	3	9
47	 You begged me not to send Theon	4	3	9
48	 to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.	4	3	9
49	 Now Winterfell is burnt to the ground,	5	3	9
50	 the North is overrun with ironborn,	5	3	9
51	 and Bran and Rickon are gone.	5	3	9
52	 So Casterly Rock...	5	3	9
53	 I'm asking your advice.	5	3	9
54	 We have enough men?	5	3	9
55	 If Walder Frey cooperates.	5	3	9
56	 If Walder Frey cooperates.	5	3	9
57	 If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing	5	3	9
58	 before we take the castle...	5	3	9
59	 we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea.	6	3	9
60	 We'll lose the war and die the way Father died.	6	3	9
61	 Or worse.	6	3	9
62	 Show them how it feels to lose what they love.	6	3	9
63	 My honored guests...	7	3	9
64	 be welcome within my walls	7	3	9
65	 and at my table.	7	3	9
66	 I extend to you my hospitality	7	3	9
67	 and protection in the light of the Seven.	7	3	9
68	 We thank you for your hospitality, my lord.	7	3	9
69	 I have come to make my apologies, my lord,	7	3	9
70	 and to beg your forgiveness.	7	3	9
71	 Don't beg my forgiveness, Your Grace.	7	3	9
72	 It wasn't me you spurned. It was my girls.	7	3	9
73	 One of them was supposed to be queen.	7	3	9
74	 Now none of them are.	8	3	9
75	 This is Arwyen my daughter.	8	3	9
76	 My daughter Walda, my daughter Derwa,	8	3	9
77	 my daughter Waldra.	8	3	9
78	 My eldest granddaughters	8	3	9
79	 Ginia and Neila.	8	3	9
80	 Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins.	8	3	9
81	 You could have had either.	8	3	9
82	 Could have had both for all I care.	8	3	9
83	 My granddaughter Marianne.	8	3	9
84	 My granddaughter Freya.	8	3	9
85	 My granddaughter...	8	3	9
86	 Wertha.	8	3	9
87	 Waldra.	8	3	9
88	 Waldina.	9	3	9
89	 - I'm Merry. - Fine.	9	3	9
90	 And here's my youngest daughter Shirei,	9	3	9
91	 though she hasn't bled yet.	9	3	9
92	 Clearly you don't have the patience for all that.	9	3	9
93	 My ladies.	9	3	9
94	 All men should keep their word, kings most of all.	9	3	9
95	 I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow.	9	3	9
96	 The fault is not with you.	9	3	9
97	 Any man would be lucky to have any one of you.	9	3	9
98	 I did what I did not to slight you,	9	3	9
99	 but because I loved another.	9	3	9
100	 I know these words cannot set right	9	3	9
101	 the wrong I have done to you and your house.	9	3	9
102	 I beg your forgiveness	9	3	9
103	 and pledge to do all I can to make amends	9	3	9
104	 so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell	9	3	9
105	 may once again be friends.	10	3	9
106	 Very good.	10	3	9
107	 There she is.	10	3	9
108	 Come closer.	10	3	9
109	 Let me have a look at you.	10	3	9
110	 Still can't see you.	10	3	9
111	 Old eyes.	10	3	9
112	 Love.	10	3	9
113	 That's what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh?	10	3	9
114	 Very honorable.	11	3	9
115	 I call it a pretty face.	11	3	9
116	 Mmm, very pretty.	11	3	9
117	 Prettier than this lot, that's for sure.	11	3	9
118	 Very shapely as well.	11	3	9
119	 Oh, you try to hide her under that dress.	11	3	9
120	 If you wanted to hide her,	11	3	9
121	 you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place.	11	3	9
122	 I can always see	11	3	9
123	 what's going on beneath a dress.	11	3	9
124	 Been at this a long time.	11	3	9
125	 I bet when you take that dress off,	11	3	9
126	 everything stays right where it is.	11	3	9
127	 Doesn't drop an inch.	11	3	9
128	 Your king says he betrayed me for love.	11	3	9
129	 I say he betrayed me for firm tits	12	3	9
130	 and a tight fit.	12	3	9
131	 And I can respect that.	12	3	9
132	 When I was your age, I'd have broken 50 oaths	12	3	9
133	 to get into that without a second thought.	12	3	9
134	 Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot.	12	3	9
135	 We'll set up tents outside	12	3	9
136	 with food and ale for the rest of your men.	12	3	9
137	 Thank you, my lord.	12	3	9
138	 Well, let's get ready.	12	3	9
139	 The wine will flow red	12	3	9
140	 and the music will play loud	12	3	9
141	 and we'll put this mess behind us.	12	3	9
142	 Where?	13	3	9
143	 There.	13	3	9
144	 There. It's a back gate.	13	3	9
145	 My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves.	13	3	9
146	 Your men, but not you?	13	3	9
147	 I have no interest in slaves.	13	3	9
148	 A man cannot make love to property.	13	3	9
149	 This is where we enter the city.	13	3	9
150	 Very few guards. They know me.	13	3	9
151	 They let me inside--	13	3	9
152	 We're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate.	13	3	9
153	 I kill the guards. I take your two best men	13	3	9
154	 and lead them through the back streets, which I know well,	13	3	9
155	 and open the front gates.	13	3	9
156	 Then comes the army.	13	3	9
157	 Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours.	13	3	9
158	 Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter,	14	3	9
159	 cutting the head off our army.	14	3	9
160	 The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee	14	3	9
161	 and you won't have to split it three ways	14	3	9
162	 'cause you've already slaughtered your partners.	14	3	9
163	 You have a very suspicious mind.	14	3	9
164	 In my experience, only dishonest people think this way.	14	3	9
165	 You command the Unsullied.	14	3	9
166	 What do you think?	14	3	9
167	 _	14	3	9
168	 _	14	3	9
169	 _	14	3	9
170	 You leave tonight.	14	3	9
171	 Very good.	14	3	9
172	 We'll prepare.	14	3	9
173	 Ser Jorah.	14	3	9
174	 You can use an extra sword.	14	3	9
175	 You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan.	15	3	9
176	 Your place is by the queen.	15	3	9
177	 If we are truly her loyal servants,	15	3	9
178	 we'll do whatever needs to be done	15	3	9
179	 no matter the cost, no matter our pride.	15	3	9
180	 We're west of Castle Black,	15	3	9
181	 but the Nightfort's closest to us.	15	3	9
182	 It was the first castle on the Wall.	15	3	9
183	 The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I.	15	3	9
184	 Too big. Impossible to maintain.	15	3	9
185	 Other than Castle Black itself,	15	3	9
186	 the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us.	15	3	9
187	 It's got a secret sally port,	15	3	9
188	 the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself.	15	3	9
189	 No one's used it in centuries most likely.	15	3	9
190	 It leads through the Wall	15	3	9
191	 right down into the Nightfort,	15	3	9
192	 if one knows how to find it,	16	3	9
193	 which, it just so happens, I do.	16	3	9
194	 How do you know all that?	16	3	9
195	 I read about it in a very old book.	16	3	9
196	 You know all that	16	3	9
197	 from staring at marks on paper?	16	3	9
198	 Yes.	16	3	9
199	 You're like a wizard.	16	3	9
200	 Our father used to tell us	16	3	9
201	 that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived.	16	3	9
202	 Here we are.	17	3	9
203	 Alive.	17	3	9
204	 Remember what happens to children who run.	17	3	9
205	 I'm your father and I'll do the talking.	17	3	9
206	 The roads have gone right to hell, haven't they?	17	3	9
207	 Cracked three spokes this morning.	17	3	9
208	 - Need a hand? - Need about eight hands.	17	3	9
209	 Oh!	17	3	9
210	 Got to get this salt pork to the Twins	17	3	9
211	 in time for the wedding.	17	3	9
212	 Many thanks.	18	3	9
213	 Don't!	18	3	9
214	 Don't kill him.	18	3	9
215	 Dead rats don't squeak.	18	3	9
216	 You're so dangerous, aren't you?	18	3	9
217	 Saying scary things to little girls.	18	3	9
218	 Killing little boys and old people.	18	3	9
219	 A real hard man you are.	18	3	9
220	 More than anyone you know.	18	3	9
221	 You're wrong. I know a killer.	18	3	9
222	 - A real killer. - That so?	18	3	9
223	 You'd be like a kitten to him.	18	3	9
224	 He'd kill you with his little finger.	18	3	9
225	 That him?	18	3	9
226	 - No. - Good.	18	3	9
227	 Don't kill him.	18	3	9
228	 Please.	18	3	9
229	 Please don't.	18	3	9
230	 You're very kind.	18	3	9
231	 Someday it'll get you killed.	18	3	9
232	 Where are we?	19	3	9
233	 The Gift, I think.	19	3	9
234	 Brandon the Builder gave all this land	19	3	9
235	 south of the Wall to the Night's Watch	19	3	9
236	 for their sustenance and support.	19	3	9
237	 Maester Luwin taught me that.	19	3	9
238	 Doesn't seem to be supporting anyone at the moment.	19	3	9
239	 It's good land and there's no war up here.	19	3	9
240	 Why leave?	19	3	9
241	 Wildlings.	19	3	9
242	 Sorry.	19	3	9
243	 But they come over the Wall and raid,	19	3	9
244	 steal, carry off women.	19	3	9
245	 Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup	19	3	9
246	 and make you drink your own blood from it.	19	3	9
247	 That's what Old Nan said.	20	3	9
248	 There's a storm coming.	20	3	9
249	 I don't see any--	20	3	9
250	 It's as good a place to shelter as any.	20	3	9
251	 We can drink some blood while we wait.	20	3	9
252	 I don't need much.	20	3	9
253	 Only one old man and eight good horses.	20	3	9
254	 What's one old man doing with eight horses?	20	3	9
255	 He breeds them for the Watch.	20	3	9
256	 How's he keep folks from stealing them?	20	3	9
257	 The Watch protects him.	20	3	9
258	 Not today they don't.	20	3	9
259	 He's selling horses, he's got some gold in there.	20	3	9
260	 - And proper steel. - Let's carve him up.	21	3	9
261	 We just take the horses and go.	21	3	9
262	 The old man's no threat.	21	3	9
263	 I keep telling you.	21	3	9
264	 He's an old man.	21	3	9
265	 A spear through the heart's a better way to die	21	3	9
266	 than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.	21	3	9
267	 The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief.	21	3	9
268	 They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.	21	3	9
269	 I hope so.	21	3	9
270	 Killing crows in their castle is tough.	21	3	9
271	 Killing them out here in the open,	21	3	9
272	 that's what we do.	21	3	9
273	 Spread out.	21	3	9
274	 Surround the hut and move in.	21	3	9
275	 Ygritte!	22	3	9
276	 Clear the barn!	22	3	9
277	 No one's going to believe you're a hog farmer if you eat them all.	23	3	9
278	 Best part of the animal.	23	3	9
279	 Don't worry. They're still there.	23	3	9
280	 I know they're still there.	23	3	9
281	 You check every five minutes	23	3	9
282	 like you're afraid they're gonna move.	23	3	9
283	 I'm not afraid.	23	3	9
284	 Of course you are.	23	3	9
285	 You're almost there	23	3	9
286	 and you're afraid you won't make it.	23	3	9
287	 The closer you get, the worse the fear gets.	23	3	9
288	 No point in trying to hide behind that face.	24	3	9
289	 I know fear when I see it.	24	3	9
290	 Seen it a lot.	24	3	9
291	 I knew fear when I saw it in you.	24	3	9
292	 You're afraid of fire.	24	3	9
293	 When Beric's sword went up in flames,	24	3	9
294	 you looked like a scared little girl.	24	3	9
295	 And I know why, too.	24	3	9
296	 I heard what your brother did to you.	24	3	9
297	 Pressed your face to the fire	24	3	9
298	 like you're a nice juicy mutton chop.	24	3	9
299	 That give you some ideas?	24	3	9
300	 Might do.	24	3	9
301	 Go ahead, then.	24	3	9
302	 You might get away.	24	3	9
303	 Might even make it there on your own.	25	3	9
304	 They're just over the river.	25	3	9
305	 The closest you've been to family	25	3	9
306	 since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy's neck.	25	3	9
307	 Someday I'm gonna put a sword through your eye	25	3	9
308	 and out the back of your skull.	25	3	9
309	 How are we going to get past the Wall?	25	3	9
310	 My uncle said it's 700 feet high.	25	3	9
311	 How did you get past it?	26	3	9
312	 Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.	26	3	9
313	 It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals.	26	3	9
314	 Some climb straight up the ice.	26	3	9
315	 Even Hodor's not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back.	26	3	9
316	 Hodor.	26	3	9
317	 19 castles guard the Wall.	26	3	9
318	 - Only three are still manned. - Hodor!	26	3	9
319	 One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through.	26	3	9
320	 My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone	26	3	9
321	 when the castles were deserted.	26	3	9
322	 Well, we'll have to open them up again.	26	3	9
323	 - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - There's a rider out there.	26	3	9
324	 Just one?	26	3	9
325	 - There's more. - Hodor!	26	3	9
326	 Shh. Shh.	27	3	9
327	 - It's just thunder, sweet giant. - Hodor.	27	3	9
328	 I yield.	27	3	9
329	 - I yield. - Wildlings.	27	3	9
330	 Where's Shaggydog and Summer?	27	3	9
331	 Hunting.	27	3	9
332	 Hodor!	27	3	9
333	 - Shh, quiet, Hodor. - Hodor!	27	3	9
334	 Make him shut up. If they hear us...	27	3	9
335	 - Hush, Hodor. No-- no more Hodoring. - Hodor!	27	3	9
336	 - Hodor! - Hodor, calm down.	27	3	9
337	 - You need to keep quiet. - They're gonna hear us.	27	3	9
338	 Hodor, be quiet.	27	3	9
339	 - Ah! Hodor! - Hodor, calm down.	27	3	9
340	 - Hodor! Hodor! - Hodor, be quiet!	27	3	9
341	 What did you do?	28	3	9
342	 Nothing.	28	3	9
343	 I don't know.	28	3	9
344	 What's that?	28	3	9
345	 That's a horse dying.	28	3	9
346	 Bring them over here.	28	3	9
347	 That was the last of them. The rest are dead.	28	3	9
348	 I heard shouting up there.	28	3	9
349	 Thunder.	28	3	9
350	 I know the difference between shouting and thunder.	28	3	9
351	 Maybe it's ghosts.	28	3	9
352	 That won't help you, grandpa.	29	3	9
353	 Where you riding?	29	3	9
354	 Doesn't matter now, does it?	29	3	9
355	 No, it doesn't matter now.	29	3	9
356	 Cut his throat or he'll tell the crows we're here.	29	3	9
357	 You understand.	29	3	9
358	 Let me stand at least.	29	3	9
359	 Let me go with a bit of dignity.	29	3	9
360	 Make the crow kill him.	29	3	9
361	 You're one of us now. Prove it.	30	3	9
362	 The wolves are out there.	30	3	9
363	 I can't do it by choice.	30	3	9
364	 I don't know how. It happens in my dreams.	30	3	9
365	 You're a warg, Bran.	30	3	9
366	 It's in your blood.	30	3	9
367	 I can't.	30	3	9
368	 You just did with him.	30	3	9
369	 A wolf is nothing compared to that.	30	3	9
370	 She looks sharp.	30	3	9
371	 Do it.	30	3	9
372	 Do it.	31	3	9
373	 I told you. He's still one of them.	31	3	9
374	 Go on, boy.	31	3	9
375	 Go on!	31	3	9
376	 He's a crow.	31	3	9
377	 He'll always be a crow.	31	3	9
378	 And here's his crow wife guarding him.	31	3	9
379	 He'll stab us in the back first chance he gets.	31	3	9
380	 Kill him.	31	3	9
381	 - He's one of them. - No!	32	3	9
382	 Do you hear me?	32	3	9
383	 You're not gonna die for one of them.	32	3	9
384	 Do it.	32	3	9
385	 They'll find us if you don't.	32	3	9
386	 You were right the whole time.	32	3	9
387	 Hyah!	33	3	9
388	 When you hear a songbird's whistle, you come.	33	3	9
389	 I'm a great whistler. The greatest in the land.	33	3	9
390	 Daario Naharis.	34	3	9
391	 That one was quick.	34	3	9
392	 - There may be others. - I doubt it.	34	3	9
393	 The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them.	34	3	9
394	 That's what you call a few guards?	35	3	9
395	 Come on! What do you got, huh?	36	3	9
396	 Lord Edmure...	37	3	9
397	 I hope I'm not a disappointment to you.	37	3	9
398	 You're a delight to me, my lady.	38	3	9
399	 You may now cloak the bride	38	3	9
400	 and bring her under your protection.	38	3	9
401	 In the sight of the Seven,	38	3	9
402	 I hereby seal these two souls,	38	3	9
403	 binding them as one for eternity.	38	3	9
404	 Look upon each other and say the words.	39	3	9
405	 Father, Smith,	39	3	9
406	 Warrior, Mother,	39	3	9
407	 Maiden, Crone, Stranger...	39	3	9
408	 - I am hers... - I am his...	39	3	9
409	 - and she is mine... - and he is mine...	39	3	9
410	 ...from this day until the end of my days.	39	3	9
411	 - Is that safe? - They're long gone.	39	3	9
412	 You were right.	39	3	9
413	 I can get inside Summer's mind whenever I want.	39	3	9
414	 Of course you can.	39	3	9
415	 North of the Wall there are wildlings	39	3	9
416	 who can control all sorts of animals.	39	3	9
417	 But you did a lot more than that.	39	3	9
418	 You got inside Hodor's mind.	40	3	9
419	 They can't do that north of the Wall?	40	3	9
420	 No one can do that...	40	3	9
421	 anywhere.	40	3	9
422	 When I was looking through Summer's eyes,	40	3	9
423	 - I saw Jon. - Where?	40	3	9
424	 He was with the wildlings.	40	3	9
425	 They tried to kill him, but he got away.	40	3	9
426	 He'll be heading back to Castle Black, then.	40	3	9
427	 That's where we should go.	40	3	9
428	 For all we know, Castle Black's already under attack.	40	3	9
429	 - If this many wildlings got through-- - I already told you.	40	3	9
430	 I'm not going north of the Wall.	40	3	9
431	 Everything Jojen told me is true.	40	3	9
432	 You saw what I did to Hodor.	40	3	9
433	 I have to find the three-eyed raven.	40	3	9
434	 Listen to me, little lord.	40	3	9
435	 Don't worry.	40	3	9
436	 I'm not asking you to come with me.	40	3	9
437	 It won't be safe for Rickon.	41	3	9
438	 Me? I'm coming with you.	41	3	9
439	 No.	41	3	9
440	 You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth.	41	3	9
441	 The Umbers are our bannermen. They'll protect you.	41	3	9
442	 I'm coming with you.	41	3	9
443	 I'm your brother.	41	3	9
444	 I have to protect you.	41	3	9
445	 Right now I have to protect you.	41	3	9
446	 Robb's at war and I'm going beyond the Wall.	41	3	9
447	 If something happens to us,	41	3	9
448	 you're the heir to Winterfell.	41	3	9
449	 Would you know how to find the Last Hearth?	41	3	9
450	 You southerners build your big castles and you never move.	41	3	9
451	 You're easy to find.	41	3	9
452	 We're not southerners.	41	3	9
453	 And I don't want to leave you.	41	3	9
454	 Shh, shh. Come here, little soldier.	41	3	9
455	 You and me, we're gonna have some adventures.	42	3	9
456	 You don't have to do any of this.	42	3	9
457	 Your family took me in	42	3	9
458	 and was good to me when they had no cause to be.	42	3	9
459	 Shh.	42	3	9
460	 We'll be fine, you and me.	42	3	9
461	 The Umbers are great warriors.	42	3	9
462	 Even I heard about them growing up.	42	3	9
463	 They'll teach you how to swing a sword.	42	3	9
464	 I know how to swing a sword.	42	3	9
465	 You're leaving now? It's the middle of the night.	42	3	9
466	 I learned to walk in darkness.	42	3	9
467	 Say your good-byes, little man.	42	3	9
468	 Keep this one safe.	43	3	9
469	 He means the world to me.	43	3	9
470	 We've been waiting a long time.	43	3	9
471	 Haven't we?	43	3	9
472	 I don't know, you tell me.	43	3	9
473	 How long does it take to sack a city?	43	3	9
474	 It was just as you said.	43	3	9
475	 They did not believe until it was too late.	44	3	9
476	 Their slave soldiers	44	3	9
477	 threw down their spears and surrendered.	44	3	9
478	 And Daario Naharis?	44	3	9
479	 The city is yours, my queen.	44	3	9
480	 They're good, aren't they?	45	3	9
481	 They ought to be because they cost enough.	45	3	9
482	 Look at the crowd there.	45	3	9
483	 He complained about this marriage	45	3	9
484	 the entire ride from Riverrun,	45	3	9
485	 and now look at him.	45	3	9
486	 The gods love to reward a fool.	45	3	9
487	 - Uncle. - What?	45	3	9
488	 He's my nephew. I love him.	45	3	9
489	 And he's a damned fool.	45	3	9
490	 Don't you drink, Lord Bolton?	45	3	9
491	 Never do, my lady. Dulls the senses.	46	3	9
492	 That's the point.	46	3	9
493	 Didn't you marry one of these Frey girls?	46	3	9
494	 Aye.	46	3	9
495	 Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters	46	3	9
496	 and promised me the girl's weight in silver as a dowry.	46	3	9
497	 So I have a fat young bride.	46	3	9
498	 I hope she makes you very happy.	46	3	9
499	 Well, she's made me very rich.	46	3	9
500	 Pardon, my lord, my lady.	46	3	9
501	 I need to find a tree to piss on.	46	3	9
502	 My mother's alone with Roose Bolton.	46	3	9
503	 I should rescue her.	46	3	9
504	 Your mother is less in need of rescue	46	3	9
505	 than any woman I've ever met.	46	3	9
506	 Be kind.	46	3	9
507	 She's finally starting to like you.	46	3	9
508	 And I like her.	46	3	9
509	 But if she had her way, I would be back in Volantis	46	3	9
510	 playing my harp and you would be sitting over there	46	3	9
511	 eating blackberries out of Roslin Frey's hand.	46	3	9
512	 Perhaps I've made a terrible mistake.	47	3	9
513	 Striking your king is an act of treason.	47	3	9
514	 No, don't.	47	3	9
515	 Don't insult them.	47	3	9
516	 Your Grace.	47	3	9
517	 The septon has prayed his prayers,	47	3	9
518	 some words were said,	47	3	9
519	 and Lord Edmure	47	3	9
520	 has wrapped my daughter in a cloak.	47	3	9
521	 But they are not yet man and wife.	47	3	9
522	 A sword needs a sheath.	47	3	9
523	 And a wedding needs a bedding.	48	3	9
524	 What does my sire say?	48	3	9
525	 To bed! To bed! To bed!	48	3	9
526	 If you think the time is right, Lord Walder,	48	3	9
527	 by all means, let us bed them.	48	3	9
528	 To bed! To bed! To bed!	48	3	9
529	 Go on!	48	3	9
530	 Oh! Careful now, ladies.	49	3	9
531	 Once you set that monster free,	49	3	9
532	 there's no caging him again.	49	3	9
533	 To bed! To bed! To bed!	49	3	9
534	 Poor girl.	49	3	9
535	 Every bride suffers the same.	49	3	9
536	 I'm sure you endured yours with grace.	49	3	9
537	 Oh, Ned forbade it.	49	3	9
538	 He said it wouldn't be right if he broke a man's jaw on our wedding night.	49	3	9
539	 That is a very strange custom.	49	3	9
540	 I suppose it does seem strange	49	3	9
541	 from a foreigner's perspective.	49	3	9
542	 It seems normal to you?	49	3	9
543	 It's a tradition.	50	3	9
544	 Without the bedding ceremony, there's no real proof	50	3	9
545	 the lord and lady consummated their marriage.	50	3	9
546	 But there are other ways of providing proof.	50	3	9
547	 Boy or girl?	50	3	9
548	 I don't know.	50	3	9
549	 But if it's a boy, I know what we should name him.	50	3	9
550	 Oh, do you?	50	3	9
551	 It seems to me the father should have some say in his son's naming.	50	3	9
552	 Eddard.	50	3	9
553	 Don't you want to teach little Ned Stark	50	3	9
554	 how to ride horses?	50	3	9
555	 I do.	50	3	9
556	 Go on, line 'em up!	51	3	9
557	 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.	52	3	9
558	 Where are you going?	52	3	9
559	 Got salt pork for the feast.	52	3	9
560	 The feast is over.	52	3	9
561	 Doesn't sound like it's over.	52	3	9
562	 If I tell you it's over, it's over.	52	3	9
563	 Turn this cart around and get the hell out of here.	52	3	9
564	 Got pig's feet, too.	52	3	9
565	 Are you soft in the head?	52	3	9
566	 Turn this cart around.	52	3	9
567	 Your Grace.	53	3	9
568	 I feel I've been remiss	53	3	9
569	 in my duties.	53	3	9
570	 I've given you meat and wine and music,	53	3	9
571	 but I haven't shown you	53	3	9
572	 the hospitality you deserve.	53	3	9
573	 My king has married	53	3	9
574	 and I owe my new queen a wedding gift.	53	3	9
575	 Robb!	53	3	9
576	 You ready to head home to Winterfell, right?	54	3	9
577	 Feast over yet, is it?	54	3	9
578	 Aye, it's over.	54	3	9
579	 Follow him.	55	3	9
580	 Aim!	55	3	9
581	 It's too late.	56	3	9
582	 The King in the North arises.	57	3	9
583	 Lord Walder!	57	3	9
584	 Lord Walder, enough!	57	3	9
585	 Let it end!	57	3	9
586	 Please.	57	3	9
587	 He is my son.	57	3	9
588	 My first son.	57	3	9
589	 Let him go and I swear that we will forget this.	57	3	9
590	 I swear it by the old gods and new.	57	3	9
591	 We will take no vengeance.	57	3	9
592	 You already swore me one oath right here in my castle.	57	3	9
593	 You swore by all the gods your son would marry my daughter!	57	3	9
594	 Take me for a hostage, but let Robb go.	58	3	9
595	 Robb, get up.	58	3	9
596	 Get up and walk out.	58	3	9
597	 Please!	58	3	9
598	 Please!	58	3	9
599	 And why would I let him do that?	58	3	9
600	 On my honor as a Tully,	58	3	9
601	 on my honor as a Stark,	58	3	9
602	 let him go	58	3	9
603	 or I will cut your wife's throat.	58	3	9
604	 I'll find another.	58	3	9
605	 Mother.	58	3	9
606	 The Lannisters send their regards.	59	3	9
607		59	3	9
608		0	3	9
0	 3 You've seen better days, My Lord.	2	1	9
1	 Another visit?	2	1	9
2	 It seems you're my last friend.	2	1	9
3	 No no, many still love you.	2	1	9
4	 Sansa came to court this morning	2	1	9
5	 to plead for your life.	2	1	9
6	 On her knees, begging for me, hmmm.	2	1	9
7	 Did you laugh with the others?	2	1	9
8	 You do me wrong, My Lord.	2	1	9
9	 Your blood is the last thing I want.	2	1	9
10	 I don't know what you want.	2	1	9
11	 I've given up trying to guess.	2	1	9
12	 When I was still a boy--	2	1	9
13	 before they cut my balls off with a hot knife--	2	1	9
14	 I traveled with a group of actors through the free cities.	2	1	9
15	 They taught me that each man has a role to play.	3	1	9
16	 The same is true at court.	3	1	9
17	 I am the master of whisperers.	3	1	9
18	 My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples.	3	1	9
19	 I'm a good actor, My Lord.	3	1	9
20	 Huh. Can you free me from this pit?	3	1	9
21	 I could.	3	1	9
22	 But will I?	3	1	9
23	 No.	3	1	9
24	 As I said, I'm no hero.	3	1	9
25	 What do you want? Tell me.	3	1	9
26	 No riddles, no stories-- tell me, what do you want?	3	1	9
27	 Peace.	3	1	9
28	 Did you know that your son is marching south	3	1	9
29	 with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad--	3	1	9
30	 fighting for his father's freedom.	3	1	9
31	 Robb?	3	1	9
32	 He's just a boy.	3	1	9
33	 Boys have been conquerors before.	3	1	9
34	 But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights	3	1	9
35	 is the King's-- the late King's brother.	4	1	9
36	 Lord Stannis has the best claim to the Throne,	4	1	9
37	 he is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.	4	1	9
38	 Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir.	4	1	9
39	 The Throne is his by rights.	4	1	9
40	 Tsk tsk. Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life,	4	1	9
41	 it would be a shame to throw it away.	4	1	9
42	 Cersei is no fool.	4	1	9
43	 She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.	4	1	9
44	 You want me to serve the woman who murdered my King,	4	1	9
45	 who butchered my men, who crippled my son?	4	1	9
46	 I want you to serve the realm!	4	1	9
47	 Tell the Queen you will confess your vile treason,	4	1	9
48	 tell your son to lay down his sword	4	1	9
49	 and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir.	4	1	9
50	 Cersei knows you as a man of honor.	4	1	9
51	 If you give her the peace she needs	4	1	9
52	 and promise to carry her secret to your grave,	4	1	9
53	 I believe she will allow you to take the Black and live out your days	5	1	9
54	 on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son.	5	1	9
55	 You think my life is some precious thing to me?	5	1	9
56	 That I would trade my honor for a few more years of...	5	1	9
57	 Of what?	5	1	9
58	 You grew up with actors.	5	1	9
59	 You learned their craft and you learned it well.	5	1	9
60	 But I grew up with soldiers.	5	1	9
61	 I learned how to die a long time ago.	5	1	9
62	 Pity.	5	1	9
63	 Such a pity.	5	1	9
64	 What of your daughter's life, My Lord?	5	1	9
65	 Is that a precious thing to you?	5	1	9
66	 It's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.	6	1	9
67	 Or so Walder Frey would have you think.	6	1	9
68	 Keep shooting them down. We can't risk Lord Walder	6	1	9
69	 sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.	6	1	9
70	 He's grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?	6	1	9
71	 Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised.	6	1	9
72	 Look.	7	1	9
73	 Father rots in a dungeon.	7	1	9
74	 How long before they take his head?	7	1	9
75	 We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.	7	1	9
76	 Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing.	7	1	9
77	 We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.	7	1	9
78	 Not in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.	7	1	9
79	 The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years,	7	1	9
80	 and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll.	7	1	9
81	 Have my horse saddled and ready.	7	1	9
82	 Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannis.	7	1	9
83	 Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.	7	1	9
84	 My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing.	7	1	9
85	 Whatever it took.	7	1	9
86	 If I'm going to lead this army,	7	1	9
87	 I can't have other men doing my bargaining for me.	7	1	9
88	 I agree.	7	1	9
89	 - I'll go. -  You can't!	7	1	9
90	 I have known Lord Walder since I was a girl.	7	1	9
91	 He would never harm me.	8	1	9
92	 Unless there was a profit in it.	8	1	9
93	 What do you want?	8	1	9
94	 It is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, My Lord.	8	1	9
95	 Oh spare me.	8	1	9
96	 Your boy's too proud to come before me himself.	8	1	9
97	 What am I supposed to do with you?	8	1	9
98	 Father, you forget yourself. Lady Stark is here--	8	1	9
99	 Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet,	8	1	9
100	 not until I die. Do I look dead to you?	8	1	9
101	 Father, please--	8	1	9
102	 I need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard?	8	1	9
103	 Your mother would still be a milkmaid	8	1	9
104	 if I hadn't squirted you into her belly.	8	1	9
105	 All right, you come forward.	8	1	9
106	 There. Now that I've observed the courtesies,	9	1	9
107	 perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths.	9	1	9
108	 Is there somewhere we can talk?	9	1	9
109	 We're talking right now.	9	1	9
110	 Fine.	9	1	9
111	 Out! All of you!	9	1	9
112	 You too.	9	1	9
113	 You see that?	9	1	9
114	 15 she is.	9	1	9
115	 A little flower.	9	1	9
116	 And her honey's all mine.	9	1	9
117	 I'm sure she will give you many sons.	10	1	9
118	 Huh. Your father didn't come to the wedding.	10	1	9
119	 He is quite ill, My Lord.	10	1	9
120	 Didn't come to the last one either.	10	1	9
121	 Or the one before that.	10	1	9
122	 Your family has always pissed on me.	10	1	9
123	 - My Lord, I-- - Don't deny it. You know it's true.	10	1	9
124	 The fine Lord Tully	10	1	9
125	 would never marry any of his children to mine.	10	1	9
126	 I'm sure there were reasons why--	10	1	9
127	 I didn't need reasons. I needed to get rid	10	1	9
128	 of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up?	10	1	9
129	 Why are you here?	10	1	9
130	 To ask you	10	1	9
131	 to open your gates, My Lord,	10	1	9
132	 so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way.	10	1	9
133	 Why should I let him?	10	1	9
134	 If you could climb your own battlements,	10	1	9
135	 you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls.	11	1	9
136	 They'll be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here.	11	1	9
137	 Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark.	11	1	9
138	 Your husband's in a cell beneath the Red Keep	11	1	9
139	 and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm.	11	1	9
140	 You swore an oath to my father.	11	1	9
141	 Oh yes, I said some words...	11	1	9
142	 And I swore oaths to the crown too, if I remember right.	11	1	9
143	 Joffrey's King now, which makes your boy	11	1	9
144	 and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me.	11	1	9
145	 If I had the sense the Gods gave a fish,	11	1	9
146	 I'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.	11	1	9
147	 - Why don't you? - Stark, Tully,	11	1	9
148	 Lannister, Baratheon,	11	1	9
149	 give me one good reason	11	1	9
150	 why I should waste a single thought on any of you?	11	1	9
151	 And... engage.	11	1	9
152	 When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?	11	1	9
153	 - Soon, he says. - Good.	11	1	9
154	 You'll be ready for this then.	12	1	9
155	 I thought a wolf was more appropriate for you	12	1	9
156	 than a bear...	12	1	9
157	 So I had a new pommel made. It's called Longclaw.	12	1	9
158	 Works as well for a wolf as a bear, I think.	12	1	9
159	 This is Valyrian steel.	12	1	9
160	 It was my father's sword,	12	1	9
161	 his father before him.	12	1	9
162	 The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries.	12	1	9
163	 It was meant for my son Jorah.	12	1	9
164	 He brought dishonor to our House,	12	1	9
165	 but he had the grace to leave the sword	12	1	9
166	 before he fled from Westeros.	12	1	9
167	 My Lord, you honor me, but I can't--	12	1	9
168	 Oh, you can and you will.	12	1	9
169	 I wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast.	13	1	9
170	 A bloody dead man tried to kill me...	13	1	9
171	 So you'll take it. I'll hear no more about it.	13	1	9
172	 - Is that understood? - Yes, My Lord.	13	1	9
173	 Right. Now don't think this means	13	1	9
174	 I approve of this nonsense	13	1	9
175	 with you and Alliser Thorne.	13	1	9
176	 That's a man's sword,	13	1	9
177	 it'll take a man to wield it.	13	1	9
178	 I'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.	13	1	9
179	 No you won't!	13	1	9
180	 I sent him to King's Landing yesterday.	13	1	9
181	 The hand that your wolf	13	1	9
182	 tore off that thing's wrist--	13	1	9
183	 I've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this...	13	1	9
184	 Boy King.	13	1	9
185	 That should get young Joffrey's attention.	13	1	9
186	 And it puts a thousand leagues	13	1	9
187	 between you and Thorne.	13	1	9
188	 Now go and put your sword somewhere safe	13	1	9
189	 and bring me my supper.	14	1	9
190	 Yes, My Lord.	14	1	9
191	 - Well done. - Well done.	14	1	9
192	 You earned that, Snow.	14	1	9
193	 Well done.	14	1	9
194	 Go on, let's have a look.	14	1	9
195	 - At what? -  The sword! Show us the sword.	14	1	9
196	 Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!	14	1	9
197	 - Let's have a look. - Piss off.	14	1	9
198	 Get off of it. Piss off.	14	1	9
199	 Come on, I want to have a look at it in the light.	14	1	9
200	 Give it here!	15	1	9
201	 What is it?	15	1	9
202	 - I-- - Look at its eyes.	15	1	9
203	 - Give it. - I can't.	15	1	9
204	 You can't what?	15	1	9
205	 I-- I'm really not supposed to say.	15	1	9
206	 And yet you really want to say.	15	1	9
207	 You want to say that...?	15	1	9
208	 There was a raven.	15	1	9
209	 I read the message to Maester Aemon.	15	1	9
210	 It's your brother Robb.	15	1	9
211	 What?	15	1	9
212	 What about him?	15	1	9
213	 He's heading south.	15	1	9
214	 To war.	15	1	9
215	 All his bannermen have rallied to his side. They'll keep him safe.	15	1	9
216	 I should be there.	15	1	9
217	 I should be with him.	16	1	9
218	 ...If we do that, they'll never get back across.	16	1	9
219	 Well?	16	1	9
220	 What did he say?	16	1	9
221	 Lord Walder has granted your crossing.	16	1	9
222	 - His men are yours as well-- -  Huh.	16	1	9
223	 --Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing	16	1	9
224	 against any who would pursue you.	16	1	9
225	 And what does he want in return?	16	1	9
226	 You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire.	16	1	9
227	 - He expects a knighthood in good time. - Fine fine.	16	1	9
228	 And?	16	1	9
229	 And Arya	16	1	9
230	 will marry his son Waldron	16	1	9
231	 - when they both come of age. - She won't be happy about that.	16	1	9
232	 Hmmm.	17	1	9
233	 And?	17	1	9
234	 And	17	1	9
235	 when the fighting is done...	17	1	9
236	 You will marry one of his daughters.	17	1	9
237	 Whichever you prefer.	17	1	9
238	 He has a number he thinks will be... suitable.	17	1	9
239	 I see.	17	1	9
240	 Did you get a look at his daughters?	17	1	9
241	 I did.	17	1	9
242	 And?	17	1	9
243	 One was...	17	1	9
244	 Do you consent?	17	1	9
245	 Can I refuse?	17	1	9
246	 Not if you want to cross.	17	1	9
247	 Then I consent.	17	1	9
248	 Sam said you wanted to see me?	18	1	9
249	 I did indeed.	18	1	9
250	 Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me.	18	1	9
251	 Tell me, did you ever wonder	19	1	9
252	 why the men of The Night's Watch	19	1	9
253	 take no wives and father no children?	19	1	9
254	 No.	19	1	9
255	 So they will not love.	19	1	9
256	 Love is the death of duty.	19	1	9
257	 If the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose	19	1	9
258	 between honor on the one hand	19	1	9
259	 and those he loves on the other,	19	1	9
260	 what would he do?	19	1	9
261	 He would do whatever was right. No matter what.	19	1	9
262	 Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000.	19	1	9
263	 Most of us are not so strong.	19	1	9
264	 What is honor	19	1	9
265	 compared to a woman's love?	19	1	9
266	 And what is duty	19	1	9
267	 against the feel of a newborn son in your arms?	19	1	9
268	 Or a brother's smile?	19	1	9
269	 Sam told you.	20	1	9
270	 We're all human.	20	1	9
271	 Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it.	20	1	9
272	 Honor comes easy then.	20	1	9
273	 Yet sooner or later	20	1	9
274	 in every man's life	20	1	9
275	 there comes a day when it is not easy,	20	1	9
276	 a day when he must choose.	20	1	9
277	 And this is my day?	20	1	9
278	 Is that what you're saying?	20	1	9
279	 Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh yes.	20	1	9
280	 - I know. - You do not know!	20	1	9
281	 No one knows.	20	1	9
282	 I may be a bastard,	20	1	9
283	 but he is my father and Robb is my brother.	20	1	9
284	 The Gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows.	20	1	9
285	 They waited till I was old.	20	1	9
286	 What could I do when the ravens brought the news from the South--	21	1	9
287	 the ruin of my House, the death of my family?	21	1	9
288	 I was helpless,	21	1	9
289	 blind, frail.	21	1	9
290	 But when I heard	21	1	9
291	 they had killed my brother's son,	21	1	9
292	 and his poor son...	21	1	9
293	 And the children!	21	1	9
294	 Even the little children.	21	1	9
295	 Who are you?	21	1	9
296	 My father was Maekar,	21	1	9
297	 the first of his name.	21	1	9
298	 My brother Aegon reigned after him	21	1	9
299	 when I had refused the Throne.	21	1	9
300	 And he was followed by his son Aerys,	21	1	9
301	 whom they called the Mad King.	21	1	9
302	 You're Aemon Targaryen.	21	1	9
303	 I'm a Maester of the Citadel,	22	1	9
304	 bound in service to Castle Black and The Night's Watch.	22	1	9
305	 I will not tell you to stay or go.	22	1	9
306	 You must make that choice yourself,	22	1	9
307	 and live with it for the rest of your days.	22	1	9
308	 As I have.	22	1	9
309	 Drogo.	22	1	9
310	 Sajo anni.	23	1	9
311	 Hyah hyah.	24	1	9
312	 Our scouts tell us	24	1	9
313	 the Stark host has moved south from the Twins	24	1	9
314	 with Lord Frey's levies in tow.	24	1	9
315	 They're a day's march north.	24	1	9
316	 The boy may lack experience and sense,	24	1	9
317	 but he does have a certain mindless	24	1	9
318	 - provincial courage. - Ah.	24	1	9
319	 Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt.	24	1	9
320	 I do hope your savages are going to be of some use,	24	1	9
321	 otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.	25	1	9
322	 The great hairy one insisted he must have two battle axes--	25	1	9
323	 heavy black steel, double-sided.	25	1	9
324	 Shagga likes axes.	25	1	9
325	 When the battle commences, you and your wildlings	25	1	9
326	 will be in the vanguard.	25	1	9
327	 - The vanguard? - Mm-hmm.	25	1	9
328	 Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?	25	1	9
329	 They do seem rather ferocious.	25	1	9
330	 Ferocious? Last night	25	1	9
331	 a Moon brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage.	25	1	9
332	 Three Stone Crows seized the Moon brother and opened his throat.	25	1	9
333	 Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock,	25	1	9
334	 which was fortunate, but even still	25	1	9
335	 Ulf is demanding blood money,	25	1	9
336	 which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.	25	1	9
337	 When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander.	25	1	9
338	 Surely there are ways to have me killed	25	1	9
339	 that would be less detrimental to the war effort.	25	1	9
340	 There'll be no more discussion on the matter.	25	1	9
341	 It appears I'm not hungry after all.	26	1	9
342	 Excuse me, My Lords.	26	1	9
343	 Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?	26	1	9
344	 - I took her. - Took her?	26	1	9
345	 - From whom? - From, uh...	26	1	9
346	 Ser-- what's his name?	26	1	9
347	 I don't know. Ginger cunt three tents down.	26	1	9
348	 And he didn't have anything to say about it?	26	1	9
349	 He said something.	26	1	9
350	 Well, the odds of me living long enough	26	1	9
351	 for him to retaliate just dropped drastically.	26	1	9
352	 We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.	26	1	9
353	 Oh well.	26	1	9
354	 I... think I'll go and find myself one.	27	1	9
355	 Who are you?	27	1	9
356	 Who would you like me to be?	27	1	9
357	 What did your mother call you?	27	1	9
358	 Shae.	27	1	9
359	 What did your mother call you?	27	1	9
360	 My mother died giving birth to me.	27	1	9
361	 Is that why I'm here? So we can talk about our mothers?	27	1	9
362	 - What sort of accent is that? - Foreign.	27	1	9
363	 For--	27	1	9
364	 What do you want from me?	27	1	9
365	 What do I want from you?	27	1	9
366	 I want you to share my tent.	27	1	9
367	 I want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes,	27	1	9
368	 rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride.	27	1	9
369	 I want you to take no other man to bed	27	1	9
370	 for as long as we're together.	27	1	9
371	 And I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world--	27	1	9
372	 which it may well be.	27	1	9
373	 And what do I get?	28	1	9
374	 Safety.	28	1	9
375	 No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine.	28	1	9
376	 The pleasure of my company,	28	1	9
377	 which I have heard is spectacular.	28	1	9
378	 Who told you this? Women you paid?	28	1	9
379	 And three: More gold	28	1	9
380	 than you can spend if you lived a thousand years.	28	1	9
381	 Do you accept my proposal?	28	1	9
382	 Let's start with your last night in this world.	28	1	9
383	 Doth-- Dothrae...	29	1	9
384	 Ki ha-- hammi...	29	1	9
385	 Ish nokitta...	29	1	9
386	 Qana'th...	29	1	9
387	 Khaleesi.	29	1	9
388	 Come.	29	1	9
389	 He's very strong.	29	1	9
390	 No one understands how strong he is.	29	1	9
391	 - He will die tonight, Khaleesi. - He can't.	29	1	9
392	 He can't. I won't let him.	30	1	9
393	 Even a Queen doesn't have that power.	30	1	9
394	 We must go quickly. I've heard there's a good port in Asshai--	30	1	9
395	 - I won't leave him. - He's already gone, Khaleesi.	30	1	9
396	 Doth--	30	1	9
397	 Even if--	30	1	9
398	 --Even if he dies,	30	1	9
399	 why would I run?	30	1	9
400	 I am Khaleesi	30	1	9
401	 and my-- my son will be Khal after Drogo.	30	1	9
402	 This isn't Westeros where men honor blood.	30	1	9
403	 Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting	30	1	9
404	 after Drogo dies.	30	1	9
405	 Whoever wins that fight will be the new Khal.	30	1	9
406	 He won't want any rivals.	30	1	9
407	 Your boy will be plucked from your breast	30	1	9
408	 and given to the dogs.	30	1	9
409	 I won't leave him.	30	1	9
410	 The wound has festered.	31	1	9
411	 I think you should wear your armor tonight, Ser.	32	1	9
412	 I think you're right.	32	1	9
413	 You've saved me once more.	32	1	9
414	 And now you must save him.	32	1	9
415	 He's beyond the healer's skills.	32	1	9
416	 All I can do is ease his path.	32	1	9
417	 Save him and I will free you. I swear it.	32	1	9
418	 You must know a way...	32	1	9
419	 Some...	32	1	9
420	 Some magic.	32	1	9
421	 There is a spell.	32	1	9
422	 Some would say death is cleaner.	32	1	9
423	 Do it.	33	1	9
424	 Save him.	33	1	9
425	 There is a price.	33	1	9
426	 You'll have gold-- whatever you want.	33	1	9
427	 It's not a matter of gold. This is Bloodmagic.	33	1	9
428	 Only death pays for life.	33	1	9
429	 My death?	33	1	9
430	 No. Not your death, Khaleesi.	33	1	9
431	 Bring me his horse.	33	1	9
432	 Khaleesi, do not do this thing.	33	1	9
433	 - Let me kill this witch. - Kill her and you kill your Khal.	33	1	9
434	 This is Bloodmagic. It is forbidden.	34	1	9
435	 I am your Khaleesi. I tell you what is forbidden.	34	1	9
436	 Go now!	34	1	9
437	 - Take her and leave. - Huh-uh.	34	1	9
438	 Take her!	34	1	9
439	 Irriya?	34	1	9
440	 You must go also, lady.	34	1	9
441	 Once I begin to sing, no one must enter the tent.	34	1	9
442	 The dead will dance here tonight.	34	1	9
443	 No one will enter.	34	1	9
444	 Bring him back to me.	35	1	9
445	 What have you done?	35	1	9
446	 I have to save him.	35	1	9
447	 We could have been 10 miles away from here by now on the way to Asshai.	35	1	9
448	 You would have been safe.	35	1	9
449	 Jni'th vos eo.	35	1	9
450	 Mra qothoon vosaan--	35	1	9
451	 Khaleesi!	35	1	9
452	 Are you hurt?	36	1	9
453	 - The baby... - Hmm?	36	1	9
454	 ...Is coming.	36	1	9
455	 - Fetch the midwives. - They will not come.	36	1	9
456	 They say she is cursed.	36	1	9
457	 They'll come or I'll have their heads.	36	1	9
458	 The witch-- she can bring baby.	36	1	9
459	 I hear her say so.	36	1	9
460	 Are you in agony, my lion?	37	1	9
461	 - No. - You look like you're in agony.	37	1	9
462	 The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.	37	1	9
463	 Ahhh.	37	1	9
464	 Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?	37	1	9
465	 - Just used to it. - Drink.	37	1	9
466	 Let's play a new game.	37	1	9
467	 There's a Braavosi knife game I could teach you--	37	1	9
468	 Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?	37	1	9
469	 - Not if you win. - No!	37	1	9
470	 No more fire games, no knife games.	37	1	9
471	 Let's do something I'm good at.	38	1	9
472	 What are you good at?	38	1	9
473	 I happen to be a great judge of character.	38	1	9
474	 - This sounds like a boring game. - It's not.	38	1	9
475	 Here's how it works: I make a statement	38	1	9
476	 about your past. If I'm right,	38	1	9
477	 you drink. If I'm wrong, I drink.	38	1	9
478	 And no lying. I'll know if you're lying.	38	1	9
479	 I don't want to play this game.	38	1	9
480	 Fine. Bronn first.	38	1	9
481	 Your father beat you.	38	1	9
482	 But my mother hit harder.	38	1	9
483	 You killed your first man before you were 12.	38	1	9
484	 It was a woman.	38	1	9
485	 She swung an axe at me.	38	1	9
486	 You've been North of the Wall.	38	1	9
487	 What brought you up there?	39	1	9
488	 Work.	39	1	9
489	 And...	39	1	9
490	 You once loved a woman many years ago,	39	1	9
491	 but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again.	39	1	9
492	 Oh wait, that's me.	39	1	9
493	 Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.	39	1	9
494	 I don't want to play.	39	1	9
495	 It's fun! Look at the fun we're having.	39	1	9
496	 Your mother was a whore.	39	1	9
497	 Drink.	39	1	9
498	 All right.	39	1	9
499	 Your father left the family when you were very young,	39	1	9
500	 - never to return. - Drink.	39	1	9
501	 And we've established the rules about lying?	39	1	9
502	 Drink!	39	1	9
503	 Mmmm.	40	1	9
504	 You wanted a different life.	40	1	9
505	 You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.	40	1	9
506	 The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.	40	1	9
507	 So specifics--	40	1	9
508	 you wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there?	40	1	9
509	 I don't believe the life of the silent sisters is for you.	40	1	9
510	 So what's a lowborn girl to do?	40	1	9
511	 Drink.	40	1	9
512	 - Are you sure-- - drink!	40	1	9
513	 And don't talk about my mother and father ever	40	1	9
514	 or I will carve your eyes from your head.	40	1	9
515	 My dear lady, if I have offended you, I apologize.	40	1	9
516	 My turn.	41	1	9
517	 Fine fine.	41	1	9
518	 Ask away.	41	1	9
519	 Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.	41	1	9
520	 - Who were you in love with? - That's not how the game works.	41	1	9
521	 I don't care the way the game works.	41	1	9
522	 Our Lord here used to be married.	41	1	9
523	 - Married? - How did you hear that?	41	1	9
524	 You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.	41	1	9
525	 Another night, perhaps.	41	1	9
526	 Not another night. This night.	41	1	9
527	 It's not a pleasant story.	41	1	9
528	 - Or maybe I will cry. - I'm guessing the lady and I	41	1	9
529	 can tell more unpleasant stories than your Lordship.	41	1	9
530	 So...	41	1	9
531	 I was 16. My brother Jaime and I were riding	41	1	9
532	 when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road,	41	1	9
533	 clothes half torn off with two men on her heels.	42	1	9
534	 Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while I wrapped her in my cloak.	42	1	9
535	 She was too scared to send off on her own,	42	1	9
536	 so while Jaime hunted down the rapers	42	1	9
537	 I took her to the nearest inn and fed her.	42	1	9
538	 Her name was Tysha.	42	1	9
539	 She was a wheelwright's orphan.	42	1	9
540	 And she was hungry--	42	1	9
541	 together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine.	42	1	9
542	 Impossible as it seems, there was a time when I was unaccustomed to wine.	42	1	9
543	 I forgot how afraid I was around girls,	42	1	9
544	 how I was always waiting for them to laugh at me	42	1	9
545	 or look away embarrassed	42	1	9
546	 or ask me about my tall handsome brother.	42	1	9
547	 I forgot about everything but Tysha.	42	1	9
548	 And somehow I found myself in her bed.	42	1	9
549	 For three chickens, I should hope so.	42	1	9
550	 It didn't last long. I didn't know what the hell I was doing.	42	1	9
551	 But she was good to me.	42	1	9
552	 She kissed me afterwards	43	1	9
553	 and sang me a song.	43	1	9
554	 And by morning I was deep enough in love to ask for her hand.	43	1	9
555	 A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken Septon	43	1	9
556	 and there you have it-- man and wife.	43	1	9
557	 For a fortnight anyway, until the Septon sobered up	43	1	9
558	 and told my father.	43	1	9
559	 I imagine that was the end of all that.	43	1	9
560	 Not quite.	43	1	9
561	 First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth.	43	1	9
562	 The girl was a whore, you see.	43	1	9
563	 Jaime had arranged the whole thing,	43	1	9
564	 the road, the rapers-- all of it.	43	1	9
565	 He thought it was time I had a woman.	43	1	9
566	 After my brother confessed,	43	1	9
567	 my father brought in my wife	43	1	9
568	 and gave her to his guards.	43	1	9
569	 He paid her well-- a silver for each man.	43	1	9
570	 How many whores command that kind of price?	44	1	9
571	 He brought me into the barracks and made me watch.	44	1	9
572	 By the end, she had so much silver	44	1	9
573	 that the coins were slipping through her fingers	44	1	9
574	 and rolling onto the floor.	44	1	9
575	 I would have killed the man who did that to me.	44	1	9
576	 You should have known she was a whore.	44	1	9
577	 Really?	44	1	9
578	 I was 16, drunk and in love--	44	1	9
579	 A girl who was almost raped	44	1	9
580	 doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.	44	1	9
581	 As I said, I was young and stupid.	44	1	9
582	 You are still young and stupid.	44	1	9
583	 Hyah!	45	1	9
584	 What is it? What do you want?	45	1	9
585	 You're sleeping through the war.	45	1	9
586	 - What? - They stole a night's march on us.	45	1	9
587	 They're a mile north.	45	1	9
588	 - Get my squire! - You don't have a squire.	45	1	9
589	 If I die, weep for me.	45	1	9
590	 You'll be dead. How will you know?	45	1	9
591	 I'll know.	46	1	9
592	 Watch out! Move!	46	1	9
593	 Out of the way!	46	1	9
594	 - Move aside! - ( Neighs	46	1	9
595	 stay low.	46	1	9
596	 Stay low?	46	1	9
597	 If you're lucky, no one will notice you.	46	1	9
598	 I was born lucky.	46	1	9
599	 Tribesmen of the Vale,	46	1	9
600	 gather round!	46	1	9
601	 Stone Crows!	46	1	9
602	 Black Ears! Burned Men!	46	1	9
603	 - Moon brothers! -  And painted dogs!	46	1	9
604	 And painted dogs!	46	1	9
605	 Your dominion over the Vale begins now!	46	1	9
606	 Onward to claim what is yours!	46	1	9
607	 Half man! Half man!	47	1	9
608	 Half man! Half man!	47	1	9
609	 Half man! Half man!	47	1	9
610	 To battle.	47	1	9
611	 You're a shit warrior.	47	1	9
612	 I'm alive?	48	1	9
613	 You're alive.	48	1	9
614	 Did we win?	48	1	9
615	 We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.	48	1	9
616	 How did our tribesmen do?	48	1	9
617	 Yeah, good.	48	1	9
618	 It's nice to see them getting along.	48	1	9
619	 You're wounded.	48	1	9
620	 Good of you to notice.	48	1	9
621	 I hear we won.	48	1	9
622	 Hmph. The scouts were wrong.	48	1	9
623	 There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20,000.	48	1	9
624	 Did we get the Stark boy, at least?	48	1	9
625	 He wasn't here.	48	1	9
626	 Where was he?	49	1	9
627	 With his other 18,000 men.	49	1	9
628	 And where are they?	49	1	9
629	 - We should go, My Lady. - No!	49	1	9
630	 My Lady!	49	1	9
631	 Hyah hyah!	49	1	9
632	 By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened.	50	1	9
633	 Lady Stark. I'd offer you my sword,	50	1	9
634	 but I seem to have lost it.	50	1	9
635	 It's not your sword I want.	50	1	9
636	 Give me my daughters back.	50	1	9
637	 Give me my husband.	50	1	9
638	 I've lost them too, I'm afraid.	50	1	9
639	 Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father.	50	1	9
640	 He cut down 10 of our men-- you saw him.	50	1	9
641	 He's more use to us alive than dead.	50	1	9
642	 Take him away and put him in irons.	50	1	9
643	 We could end this war right now, boy,	50	1	9
644	 save thousands of lives.	50	1	9
645	 You fight for the Starks, I fight for the Lannisters.	50	1	9
646	 Swords or lances, teeth, nails-- choose your weapons	50	1	9
647	 and let's end this here and now.	50	1	9
648	 If we do it your way, Kingslayer,	51	1	9
649	 you'd win.	51	1	9
650	 We're not doing it your way.	51	1	9
651	 Come on, pretty man.	51	1	9
652	 I sent 2,000 men to their graves today.	51	1	9
653	 The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.	51	1	9
654	 Aye. But the dead won't hear them.	51	1	9
655	 One victory does not make us conquerors.	51	1	9
656	 Did we free my father?	51	1	9
657	 Did we rescue my sisters from the Queen?	51	1	9
658	 Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees?	51	1	9
659	 This war is far from over.	52	1	9
660	 Could I have one?	52	1	9
661	 A lemon one-- or any of them.	52	1	9
662	 Three coppers.	52	1	9
663	 How about a nice fat pigeon?	52	1	9
664	 Piss off now. Go on.	52	1	9
665	 Do you have any stale ones from yesterday?	52	1	9
666	 - Or any burnt ones? - Piss off!	52	1	9
667	 Hey, where's everyone going? What's happening?	53	1	9
668	 They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.	53	1	9
669	 Who?	53	1	9
670	 The Hand of the King.	53	1	9
671	 - Traitor! - Coward!	54	1	9
672	 Baelor.	54	1	9
673	 Baelor!	54	1	9
674	 Traitor! Traitor!	54	1	9
675	 I am Eddard Stark,	55	1	9
676	 Lord of Winterfell	55	1	9
677	 and Hand of the King.	55	1	9
678	 I come before you to confess my treason	55	1	9
679	 in the sight of Gods and men.	55	1	9
680	 I betrayed the faith of my King	55	1	9
681	 and the trust of my friend Robert.	55	1	9
682	 I swore to protect and defend his children,	55	1	9
683	 but before his blood was cold	55	1	9
684	 I plotted to murder his son...	55	1	9
685	 And seize the Throne for myself.	55	1	9
686	 Traitor!	55	1	9
687	 Let the high Septon	55	1	9
688	 and Baelor the blessed bear witness to what I say:	55	1	9
689	 Joffrey Baratheon	56	1	9
690	 is the one true heir to the Iron Throne,	56	1	9
691	 by the Grace of all the gods,	56	1	9
692	 Lord of the Seven Kingdoms	56	1	9
693	 and Protector of the Realm.	56	1	9
694	 As we sin,	56	1	9
695	 so do we suffer.	56	1	9
696	 This man has confessed his crimes	56	1	9
697	 in sight of Gods and men.	56	1	9
698	 The Gods are just	56	1	9
699	 but beloved Baelor taught us	56	1	9
700	 they can also be merciful.	56	1	9
701	 What is to be done	56	1	9
702	 with this traitor, Your Grace?	56	1	9
703	 My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch.	57	1	9
704	 Stripped of all titles and powers,	57	1	9
705	 he would serve the realm in permanent exile.	57	1	9
706	 And My Lady Sansa	57	1	9
707	 has begged mercy for her father.	57	1	9
708	 But they have the soft hearts of women.	57	1	9
709	 So long as I am your King,	57	1	9
710	 treason shall never go unpunished.	57	1	9
711	 Ser Ilyn,	57	1	9
712	 bring me his head!	57	1	9
713	 No! Stop!	57	1	9
714	 Daddy! Someone stop him!	57	1	9
715	 My son, this is madness.	57	1	9
716	 Put him down!	57	1	9
717	 - Don't look! - Let me go.	58	1	9
718	 - Let me go! - Shut your mouth. Look at me.	58	1	9
719	 - Look at me! - Stop! Daddy!	58	1	9
720	 - Stop! No no! -  Traitor!	58	1	9
721	 Stop!	58	1	9
722	 Stop him, stop!	58	1	9
0	 5 You've got too much wood in there.	2	3	6
1	 But the more wood, the bigger the fire.	2	3	6
2	 It needs to breathe.	2	3	6
3	 Take off that big log.	2	3	6
4	 Huh. You know your fires.	2	3	6
5	 Someone built your fires for you growing up?	2	3	6
6	 It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach.	3	3	6
7	 And there were servants, of course.	3	3	6
8	 I knew you were highborn.	3	3	6
9	 Oh, I found something at the Fist of the First Men.	3	3	6
10	 Buried treasure.	3	3	6
11	 Thousands of years old.	3	3	6
12	 I think.	3	3	6
13	 What does it do?	3	3	6
14	 I'm not sure that it does anything.	3	3	6
15	 It's beautiful, though, isn't it?	3	3	6
16	 - How much longer? - Not so far.	3	3	6
17	 A few more days.	3	3	6
18	 Is the Wall as big as they say?	3	3	6
19	 Bigger.	3	3	6
20	 So big you can't even see the top sometimes.	4	3	6
21	 It's hidden in clouds.	4	3	6
22	 You're playing with me.	4	3	6
23	 I'm not. It's 700 feet high,	4	3	6
24	 all made of ice.	4	3	6
25	 On a warm day you can see it weeping.	4	3	6
26	 Castle Black is nice enough.	4	3	6
27	 They keep a fire burning in the long hall	4	3	6
28	 day and night.	4	3	6
29	 And Hobb makes venison stew	4	3	6
30	 with onions.	4	3	6
31	 Very tasty.	4	3	6
32	 Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing.	4	3	6
33	 Dareon sings best.	4	3	6
34	 - Do you sing? - No.	4	3	6
35	 No, no, no. Not very well.	4	3	6
36	 Sing me a song.	5	3	6
37	 Oh, all right.	5	3	6
38	 Let's see.	5	3	6
39	 Oh... ahem.	5	3	6
40	  The father's face is stern and strong 	5	3	6
41	  He sits and judges right from wrong 	5	3	6
42	  He weighs our lives, the short and long 	5	3	6
43	  And loves the little children 	5	3	6
44	  The mother gives the gift of life 	5	3	6
45	  And watches over every wife 	5	3	6
46	  Her gentle smile ends all strife 	5	3	6
47	  And she loves her little children. 	5	3	6
48	 That's not how you skin a rabbit.	5	3	6
49	 I know how to skin a rabbit.	6	3	6
50	 Not by the looks of it.	6	3	6
51	 You grow up north of the Wall,	6	3	6
52	 you learn the proper way to handle game.	6	3	6
53	 I didn't see any game before I got here.	6	3	6
54	 If I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen rabbits.	6	3	6
55	 Well, I made this bow myself.	6	3	6
56	 Guess you don't learn how to do that north of the Wall.	6	3	6
57	 You learn how to use your fists, though.	6	3	6
58	 Oh, you're gonna punch the rabbits to death?	6	3	6
59	 I had someone else in mind.	6	3	6
60	 Well, someone else is sitting right here.	6	3	6
61	 You're both very good at skinning rabbits.	6	3	6
62	 Some of us are just a little better.	6	3	6
63	 Well, some of us would say thank you when someone else	6	3	6
64	 hunts down their breakfast for them.	6	3	6
65	 Or don't they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall?	6	3	6
66	 You've got a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth.	6	3	6
67	 - Stop it! - Hodor.	7	3	6
68	 You've been fighting since you met. Just stop it.	7	3	6
69	 Lady Reed here's got a stick so far up her ass,	7	3	6
70	 it's a wonder her feet touch the ground.	7	3	6
71	 You've been nasty to her every day.	7	3	6
72	 Of course she's nasty back.	7	3	6
73	 Me? It's my fault?	7	3	6
74	 First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat.	7	3	6
75	 First time I met you, you held a knife at me.	7	3	6
76	 We can't fight each other.	7	3	6
77	 We'll never make it to the Wall.	7	3	6
78	 I want you both to make peace.	7	3	6
79	 Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker than mine.	7	3	6
80	 - I said so, didn't I? - Osha!	7	3	6
81	 You're a good little hunter.	7	3	6
82	 Thank you.	7	3	6
83	 See?	7	3	6
84	 Not so hard, is it? Thank you.	8	3	6
85	 Don't push me.	8	3	6
86	 Shh.	8	3	6
87	 I'm right here with you.	8	3	6
88	 What's happening?	8	3	6
89	 I'm right here with you.	8	3	6
90	 What's wrong with him?	8	3	6
91	 The visions take their toll.	8	3	6
92	 He's having one now?	8	3	6
93	 I saw Jon Snow.	9	3	6
94	 You saw him?	9	3	6
95	 At Castle Black?	9	3	6
96	 He was on the wrong side of the Wall...	9	3	6
97	 surrounded by enemies.	9	3	6
98	 Used to be you couldn't find a tree within a mile of the Wall.	9	3	6
99	 Crows would come out every morning with axes.	9	3	6
100	 Your flock gets smaller every year.	9	3	6
101	 You ever climbed it before?	9	3	6
102	 No.	9	3	6
103	 But Tormund's done it half a hundred times.	9	3	6
104	 You're afraid.	10	3	6
105	 - Aren't you? - Aye.	10	3	6
106	 It's a long way up and a long way down.	10	3	6
107	 But I've waited my whole life	10	3	6
108	 to see the world from up there.	10	3	6
109	 Here, sit down. I brought a pair for you.	10	3	6
110	 They're too big for you, but they're good.	10	3	6
111	 You kill someone for them?	10	3	6
112	 Nah.	10	3	6
113	 I didn't kill him,	10	3	6
114	 but I bet his balls are still bruised.	10	3	6
115	 He wasn't good to me the way you're good to me.	10	3	6
116	 He didn't do that thing you do with your tongue.	10	3	6
117	 Can we not talk about that here?	10	3	6
118	" ""Can we not talk about that here?"	11	3	6
119	 I'm Jon Snow.	11	3	6
120	 I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand,	11	3	6
121	" but I'm scared of naked girls."""	11	3	6
122	 Did I seem scared the other day?	11	3	6
123	 You were trembling like a leaf.	11	3	6
124	 Only in the beginning.	11	3	6
125	 Only in the beginning.	11	3	6
126	 You're a proper lover, Jon Snow.	11	3	6
127	 And don't worry.	11	3	6
128	 Your secret's safe with me.	11	3	6
129	 What secret?	11	3	6
130	 Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls	11	3	6
131	 in silk dresses you knew growing up?	11	3	6
132	 You're loyal and you're brave.	11	3	6
133	 You didn't stop being a crow	11	3	6
134	 the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.	11	3	6
135	 But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow.	12	3	6
136	 You're going to be loyal to your woman.	12	3	6
137	 The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die.	12	3	6
138	 Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die.	12	3	6
139	 We're just soldiers in their armies	12	3	6
140	 and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down.	12	3	6
141	 It's you and me	12	3	6
142	 that matters to me and you.	12	3	6
143	 Don't ever betray me.	12	3	6
144	 I won't.	12	3	6
145	 'Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right off	13	3	6
146	 and wear it 'round my neck.	13	3	6
147	 Sink your metal deep	13	3	6
148	 and make sure it holds before taking your next step.	13	3	6
149	 And if you fall,	13	3	6
150	 don't scream.	13	3	6
151	 You don't want that to be the last thing she remembers.	13	3	6
152	 Joffrey.	13	3	6
153	 Cersei.	13	3	6
154	 Ilyn Payne.	13	3	6
155	 You're good.	14	3	6
156	 You're not as good as you think you are.	14	3	6
157	 Face, tits, balls--	14	3	6
158	 I hit 'em right where I wanted to.	14	3	6
159	 Aye, but you took your sweet time of it.	14	3	6
160	 You won't be fighting straw men, little lady.	14	3	6
161	 Show me your position.	14	3	6
162	 Keep your elbow high.	14	3	6
163	 You want your back doing the hard labor.	14	3	6
164	 You're holding.	14	3	6
165	 Never hold.	14	3	6
166	 - What? - Your muscles tense up when you hold.	14	3	6
167	 Pull the string back to the center of your chin	14	3	6
168	 and release.	14	3	6
169	 Never hold.	14	3	6
170	 But I have to aim.	14	3	6
171	 Never aim.	15	3	6
172	 Never aim?	15	3	6
173	 Your eye knows where it wants the arrow to go.	15	3	6
174	 Trust your eye.	15	3	6
175	 There's someone out there.	15	3	6
176	 That's about far enough.	15	3	6
177	 We come as friends.	15	3	6
178	 Begging your pardon, m'lady,	15	3	6
179	 but we'll be the judge of that.	15	3	6
180	 Valar morghulis.	15	3	6
181	 Valar dohaeris.	15	3	6
182	 My friends here don't speak High Valyrian.	16	3	6
183	 Why are you here, my lady?	16	3	6
184	 Forgive my manners.	17	3	6
185	 I don't see many ladies these days.	17	3	6
186	 Lucky for the ladies.	17	3	6
187	 How many times has the Lord brought him back?	17	3	6
188	 Six.	17	3	6
189	 I've always been a terrible priest.	18	3	6
190	 Drank too much rum.	18	3	6
191	 Fucked all the whores in King's Landing.	18	3	6
192	 It's a terrible thing to say,	18	3	6
193	 but by the time I came to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord.	18	3	6
194	 I decided that He, that all the gods,	18	3	6
195	 were stories we told the children to make them behave.	18	3	6
196	 So I wore the robes and every now and then I'd recite the prayers,	18	3	6
197	 but it was just for show.	18	3	6
198	 A spectacle for the locals.	18	3	6
199	 Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one's heart.	18	3	6
200	 I knelt beside his cold body	19	3	6
201	 and said the old words.	19	3	6
202	 Not because I believed in them, but...	19	3	6
203	 he was my friend	19	3	6
204	 and he was dead.	19	3	6
205	 And they were the only words I knew.	19	3	6
206	 And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied.	19	3	6
207	 Beric's eyes opened	19	3	6
208	 and I knew the truth.	19	3	6
209	 Our god is the one true god.	19	3	6
210	 And all men must serve Him.	19	3	6
211	 You've been to the other side.	19	3	6
212	 The other side?	20	3	6
213	 There is no other side.	20	3	6
214	 I have been to the darkness, my lady.	20	3	6
215	 He sent you to us for a reason.	20	3	6
216	 You have someone He needs.	20	3	6
217	 Bodkin point.	20	3	6
218	 Penetrates plate at 200 yards.	20	3	6
219	 Can you make 'em?	20	3	6
220	 Yeah, nothing tricky about it.	20	3	6
221	 Just need decent steel.	20	3	6
222	 I'll get you the steel.	20	3	6
223	 Come on.	20	3	6
224	 I don't like that woman.	20	3	6
225	 That's 'cause you're a girl.	20	3	6
226	 What does that have to do with anything?	20	3	6
227	 Forgive me, lad.	21	3	6
228	 What are you doing? Let go of him.	21	3	6
229	 - Tell them to stop. - Come on.	21	3	6
230	 He wants to be one of you.	21	3	6
231	 He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them!	21	3	6
232	 We serve the Lord of Light	21	3	6
233	 and the Lord of Light needs this boy.	21	3	6
234	 Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she?	21	3	6
235	 You're not doing this for your god.	21	3	6
236	 You're doing it for gold.	21	3	6
237	 We're doing it for both, girl.	21	3	6
238	 We can't defend the people without weapons	21	3	6
239	 and horses and food.	21	3	6
240	 And we can't get weapons and horses and food without gold.	21	3	6
241	 You told me this was a Brotherhood.	21	3	6
242	 You told me I could be one of you.	22	3	6
243	 You are more than they can ever be.	22	3	6
244	 They're just foot soldiers in the great war.	22	3	6
245	 You will make kings rise and fall.	22	3	6
246	 You're a witch. You're going to hurt him.	22	3	6
247	 I see a darkness in you.	22	3	6
248	 And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me--	22	3	6
249	 brown eyes,	22	3	6
250	 blue eyes, green eyes.	22	3	6
251	 Eyes you'll shut forever.	22	3	6
252	 We will meet again.	23	3	6
253	 You staring at my ass, Jon Snow?	24	3	6
254	 You all right?	24	3	6
255	 Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad.	24	3	6
256	 Sorry. Were you sleeping?	25	3	6
257	 Wa--	25	3	6
258	 Wa--? Wa--?	25	3	6
259	 Water?	25	3	6
260	 You want some water.	25	3	6
261	 I wish I had some for you.	25	3	6
262	 So let's play a game.	25	3	6
263	 Which body part do you need the least?	25	3	6
264	 - Please. - Please is not a body part.	25	3	6
265	 I'll tell you everything, please.	26	3	6
266	 But you've already told me everything.	26	3	6
267	 Remember?	26	3	6
268	 Your daddy was mean to you.	26	3	6
269	 The Starks didn't appreciate you.	26	3	6
270	 One good bit, though.	26	3	6
271	 The Stark boys,	26	3	6
272	 they're still alive.	26	3	6
273	 Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember?	26	3	6
274	 You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you.	26	3	6
275	 Now...	26	3	6
276	 how about your little finger?	26	3	6
277	 You don't use that for much, do you?	26	3	6
278	 No? Good. Let's start with that.	26	3	6
279	 You've been wondering why you're here.	27	3	6
280	 Haven't you?	27	3	6
281	 Where you are.	27	3	6
282	 Who I am.	27	3	6
283	 Why I'm doing this to you.	27	3	6
284	 So guess.	27	3	6
285	 If you guess right,	27	3	6
286	 I'll tell you.	27	3	6
287	 By the old gods and the new, I swear it.	27	3	6
288	 You win the game	27	3	6
289	 if you can figure out who I am	27	3	6
290	 and why I'm torturing you	27	3	6
291	 and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger.	27	3	6
292	 If I win, you'll let me go?	27	3	6
293	 If you think this has a happy ending,	27	3	6
294	 you haven't been paying attention.	27	3	6
295	 Please.	27	3	6
296	 You say please again and you'll wish you hadn't.	27	3	6
297	 You first.	28	3	6
298	 Where are we?	28	3	6
299	 - The North. - Too vague.	28	3	6
300	 Deepwood Motte.	28	3	6
301	 Terrible guess.	28	3	6
302	 Now, where?	28	3	6
303	 Last Hearth.	28	3	6
304	 Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?	28	3	6
305	 Karhold!	28	3	6
306	 Karhold?	28	3	6
307	 How did you know that?	28	3	6
308	 Did you see any banners flying when we came in?	29	3	6
309	 No.	29	3	6
310	 It was just a guess.	29	3	6
311	 Very good, Lord Theon.	29	3	6
312	 And who am I?	29	3	6
313	 Torrhen Karstark.	29	3	6
314	 He's dead.	29	3	6
315	 Strangled by the Kingslayer.	29	3	6
316	 He was your brother.	29	3	6
317	 Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.	29	3	6
318	 - You swore to tell me if I-- - You're right.	29	3	6
319	 Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman.	29	3	6
320	 I betrayed Robb.	30	3	6
321	 That's why you're torturing me.	30	3	6
322	 Yes.	30	3	6
323	 You win.	30	3	6
324	 Of course, you forgot to ask one question.	30	3	6
325	 You forgot to ask if I'm a liar.	30	3	6
326	 I'm afraid I am.	30	3	6
327	 Everything I told you is a lie.	30	3	6
328	 This isn't happening to you for a reason.	30	3	6
329	 Well, one reason-- I enjoy it.	31	3	6
330	 Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off!	31	3	6
331	 I win.	31	3	6
332	 Thank you for riding here so quickly.	31	3	6
333	 I know travel isn't easy in these times.	31	3	6
334	 The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits.	31	3	6
335	 But when the King of the North summons us, we come.	31	3	6
336	 Our father has instructed us to tell you	31	3	6
337	 that his alliance with the North can continue	31	3	6
338	 if his terms are met.	31	3	6
339	 Lord Frey requires a formal apology	31	3	6
340	 for your violation of your sacred oath	31	3	6
341	 to marry one of his daughters.	31	3	6
342	 Of course. He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.	31	3	6
343	 As restitution for this betrayal,	31	3	6
344	 he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands.	31	3	6
345	 - I don't think that's-- - We are fighting for the North.	31	3	6
346	 Harrenhal is not in the North.	32	3	6
347	 It is his once the war is over	32	3	6
348	 and we have no further strategic need for it.	32	3	6
349	 And there's something else.	32	3	6
350	 We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.	32	3	6
351	 Not what, whom.	32	3	6
352	 What?	32	3	6
353	 No.	32	3	6
354	 Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed	32	3	6
355	 one of his daughters-- Roslin.	32	3	6
356	 How old is she?	32	3	6
357	 19.	32	3	6
358	 Could I see her first?	32	3	6
359	 You want to count her teeth?	32	3	6
360	 We depart for the Twins in the morning.	32	3	6
361	 We need an answer before we leave	32	3	6
362	 and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter	32	3	6
363	 or this alliance is at an end.	32	3	6
364	 Your father does realize we're in the middle of a war?	32	3	6
365	 Father is old.	32	3	6
366	 It will put his heart at peace	33	3	6
367	 if he could see her wed to a good husband.	33	3	6
368	 And his recent experience has made him wary	33	3	6
369	 of long engagements.	33	3	6
370	 He has every right to be.	33	3	6
371	 Please excuse us while we discuss it.	33	3	6
372	 Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me?	33	3	6
373	 At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were.	33	3	6
374	 I'm his liege lord.	33	3	6
375	 He's a proud man and we've wounded him.	33	3	6
376	 I didn't wound him.	33	3	6
377	 My answer is no.	33	3	6
378	 Listen to me	33	3	6
379	 and listen very carefully. You--	34	3	6
380	 The laws of gods and men are very clear.	34	3	6
381	 No man can compel another man to marry.	34	3	6
382	 The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth.	34	3	6
383	 It's all right. You heard him.	34	3	6
384	 If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead.	34	3	6
385	 He's wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12.	34	3	6
386	 He's not gonna stop wanting it now.	34	3	6
387	 When I say no, he will come back	34	3	6
388	 and offer me a daughter of my choosing.	34	3	6
389	 You're willing to risk our freedom	34	3	6
390	 and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?	34	3	6
391	 I have a war to fight.	34	3	6
392	 We can't win it without them.	34	3	6
393	 I have no time to haggle.	34	3	6
394	 You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.	34	3	6
395	 You recall that heroic engagement?	34	3	6
396	 I had something less permanent in mind.	34	3	6
397	 I've won every battle,	34	3	6
398	 but I'm losing this war.	35	3	6
399	 If we don't do this and do it now,	35	3	6
400	 we're lost.	35	3	6
401	 I'll marry her.	35	3	6
402	 You're paying for my sins, Uncle.	35	3	6
403	 It's not fair or right.	35	3	6
404	 I'll remember it.	35	3	6
405	 I see my men have finally found you	35	3	6
406	 something appropriate to wear.	35	3	6
407	 Yes. Most kind of them.	35	3	6
408	 You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton.	35	3	6
409	 I am acting on Lady Stark's orders	35	3	6
410	 to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing.	35	3	6
411	 When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner.	35	3	6
412	 If she wasn't his mother,	35	3	6
413	 he'd have hanged her for treason.	35	3	6
414	 I should send you back to Robb Stark.	36	3	6
415	 You should.	36	3	6
416	 But instead, you're sitting here	36	3	6
417	 watching me fail at dinner.	36	3	6
418	 Why might that be?	36	3	6
419	 Wars cost money.	36	3	6
420	 Many people would pay a great deal for you.	36	3	6
421	 We both know who would pay the most.	36	3	6
422	 Or make you pay the most	36	3	6
423	 if he found out you had captured me	36	3	6
424	 and sent me back up north for a summary execution.	36	3	6
425	 You're right.	36	3	6
426	 Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.	36	3	6
427	 It would be,	36	3	6
428	 if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it.	36	3	6
429	 King Robb is keeping your father quite busy.	36	3	6
430	 He doesn't have time for anything else.	36	3	6
431	 He'll make time for you.	36	3	6
432	 As soon as you're well enough to travel,	37	3	6
433	 I will allow you to go to King's Landing	37	3	6
434	 as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made.	37	3	6
435	 And you will swear to tell your father the truth,	37	3	6
436	 that I had nothing to do with your maiming.	37	3	6
437	 - Shall we drink on it? - I don't partake.	37	3	6
438	 You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?	37	3	6
439	 Very well.	37	3	6
440	 My lady,	37	3	6
441	 may our journey continue without further incident.	37	3	6
442	 Oh, she won't be going with you.	37	3	6
443	 I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to--	37	3	6
444	 You are charged with abetting treason.	37	3	6
445	 I'm afraid I must insist.	37	3	6
446	 You're in no place to insist on anything.	37	3	6
447	 I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson	37	3	6
448	 about overplaying your position.	38	3	6
449	 - Impossible. - Why?	38	3	6
450	 My grandson is the pride of Highgarden.	38	3	6
451	 The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms.	38	3	6
452	 - Your daughter-- - Is rich,	38	3	6
453	 the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms...	38	3	6
454	 and the mother of the king.	38	3	6
455	 Old.	38	3	6
456	 Old?	38	3	6
457	 Old.	38	3	6
458	 I'm something of an expert on the subject.	38	3	6
459	 Her change will be upon her before long.	38	3	6
460	 I'll spare you the details of what will happen then.	38	3	6
461	 You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter,	38	3	6
462	 but this is another matter entirely.	38	3	6
463	 The years punish us as well, I promise you that.	38	3	6
464	 My stomach remains quite strong, however.	38	3	6
465	 The only thing that might turn it	39	3	6
466	 are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities.	39	3	6
467	 - Do you deny them? - Oh, not at all.	39	3	6
468	 A sword swallower through and through.	39	3	6
469	 And a boy with his affliction	39	3	6
470	 should be grateful for the opportunity	39	3	6
471	 to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms	39	3	6
472	 and remove the stain from his name.	39	3	6
473	 Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin?	39	3	6
474	 Sons of your father's bannermen,	39	3	6
475	 squires, stable boys?	39	3	6
476	 Of course.	39	3	6
477	 And you never...	39	3	6
478	 No.	39	3	6
479	 Not once?	39	3	6
480	 Not in any way?	39	3	6
481	 Never.	39	3	6
482	 I congratulate you upon your restraint.	39	3	6
483	 But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go	39	3	6
484	 at each other beneath the sheets.	39	3	6
485	 Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance	39	3	6
486	 for unnatural behavior.	39	3	6
487	 I wouldn't say that.	40	3	6
488	 True, we don't tie ourselves in knots	40	3	6
489	 over a discreet bit of buggery, but...	40	3	6
490	 brothers and sisters--	40	3	6
491	 where I come from, that stain	40	3	6
492	 would be very difficult to wash out.	40	3	6
493	 I will not breathe further life	40	3	6
494	 into a malicious lie by discussing it.	40	3	6
495	 Lie or not,	40	3	6
496	 you must admit many people find it quite convincing.	40	3	6
497	 Convincing enough to put swords in their hands	40	3	6
498	 and send them off to kill Lannisters	40	3	6
499	 and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation.	40	3	6
500	 I don't care what people believe.	40	3	6
501	 And neither do you.	40	3	6
502	 As an authority on myself, I must disagree.	40	3	6
503	 Now, if the rumors about my children were true,	40	3	6
504	 then Joffrey is no king at all	40	3	6
505	 and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt.	41	3	6
506	 And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children,	41	3	6
507	 we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt.	41	3	6
508	 It is a chance we simply cannot take.	41	3	6
509	 The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.	41	3	6
510	 All right.	41	3	6
511	 I'll remove it for you.	41	3	6
512	 If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei,	41	3	6
513	 I will name him to the Kingsguard.	41	3	6
514	 I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows.	41	3	6
515	 He will never marry.	41	3	6
516	 - He will never have children. - Oh...	41	3	6
517	 The Tyrell name will fade.	41	3	6
518	 And Highgarden will go to the children	41	3	6
519	 of Joffrey and Margaery.	41	3	6
520	 You would have your grandson protected	41	3	6
521	 by someone who disgusts you?	41	3	6
522	 I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior	41	3	6
523	 who takes his vows seriously.	41	3	6
524	 So, shall I draw up the order?	42	3	6
525	 Or do you consent to this marriage?	42	3	6
526	 It's a rare enough thing--	42	3	6
527	 a man who lives up to his reputation.	42	3	6
528	 No!	43	3	6
529	 We've gotta cut them loose!	43	3	6
530	 No!	43	3	6
531	 Take my hand!	44	3	6
532	 That's a wonderful pin.	45	3	6
533	 Oh, it's more of a brooch, really.	45	3	6
534	 Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so...	45	3	6
535	 I'm very happy about...	45	3	6
536	 Uh, yes.	45	3	6
537	 I-I am as well.	45	3	6
538	 I feel like I'm in a dream.	45	3	6
539	 Yes, me, too. Definitely.	45	3	6
540	 I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young.	46	3	6
541	 The guests,	46	3	6
542	 the food, the tournaments.	46	3	6
543	 And the bride, of course.	46	3	6
544	 The most beautiful bride in the world	46	3	6
545	 in a beautiful gown of gold	46	3	6
546	 and green brocade with fringed sleeves.	46	3	6
547	 Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?	46	3	6
548	 No. I had never left Winterfell	46	3	6
549	 before I came to King's Landing.	46	3	6
550	 But it sounds wonderful.	46	3	6
551	 I can't wait to see it.	46	3	6
552	 And to leave this place.	46	3	6
553	 It's terrible, isn't it?	46	3	6
554	 The most terrible place there is.	46	3	6
555	 I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.	47	3	6
556	 We can have them both killed.	47	3	6
557	 It's hard to say which of the four of us	47	3	6
558	 is getting the worst of this arrangement.	47	3	6
559	 Probably Sansa.	47	3	6
560	 Though Loras will certainly come to know	47	3	6
561	 a deep and singular misery.	47	3	6
562	 Father doesn't discriminate.	47	3	6
563	 We're all being shipped off to hell together.	47	3	6
564	 On a boat you built.	47	3	6
565	 The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family.	47	3	6
566	 I did what I did to protect our family.	47	3	6
567	 I'm your family.	47	3	6
568	 A member of your family	47	3	6
569	 who has actively contributed to that family's survival.	47	3	6
570	 Whether or not you or Father	47	3	6
571	 or anyone else wants to admit it.	47	3	6
572	 I do admit it.	47	3	6
573	 If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire,	48	3	6
574	 Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here.	48	3	6
575	 Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate.	48	3	6
576	 Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you.	48	3	6
577	 There are two people in King's Landing	48	3	6
578	 who can give an order to a Kingsguard.	48	3	6
579	 Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon	48	3	6
580	 to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?	48	3	6
581	 The impulse I understand.	48	3	6
582	 He hates me because I'm the only one	48	3	6
583	 who tells him what he really is.	48	3	6
584	 So, fair enough. He wants me dead.	48	3	6
585	 But his stupidity?	49	3	6
586	 He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known.	49	3	6
587	 But the king orders a Kingsguard	49	3	6
588	 to murder the Hand of the King	49	3	6
589	 in full view of his own army.	49	3	6
590	 The boy's an idiot.	49	3	6
591	 What do you want me to say?	49	3	6
592	 I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.	49	3	6
593	 Probably.	49	3	6
594	 But not from Joffrey.	49	3	6
595	 He won't do anything now Father's here.	49	3	6
596	 Seven kingdoms united in fear	49	3	6
597	 of Tywin Lannister.	49	3	6
598	 Not the Tyrells.	49	3	6
599	 Soon they won't need to be afraid of him.	49	3	6
600	 Joffrey will belong to Margaery,	49	3	6
601	 the little doe-eyed whore.	49	3	6
602	 And so will his children and their children.	49	3	6
603	 History will be taken from our hands.	49	3	6
604	 You may escape, at least.	49	3	6
605	 Once Jaime gets back,	49	3	6
606	 Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case	49	3	6
607	 of sword through bowels.	50	3	6
608	 When Jaime gets back, yes.	50	3	6
609	 But when do we think that's going to be?	50	3	6
610	 He's out there somewhere.	50	3	6
611	 Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked.	50	3	6
612	 Who's going to tell her?	50	3	6
613	 Do you think people will like it?	50	3	6
614	 I don't think they will even notice it.	50	3	6
615	 You're right. It's not my wedding.	50	3	6
616	 Anyway, from what I can tell,	50	3	6
617	 the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior	50	3	6
618	 to the ones in King's Landing.	50	3	6
619	 They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding.	50	3	6
620	 Loras likes green and gold brocade.	50	3	6
621	 I'm sure he does.	50	3	6
622	 Will they let me invite my family?	50	3	6
623	 They haven't asked my opinion.	50	3	6
624	 But do you think they will?	50	3	6
625	 No.	51	3	6
626	 Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you.	51	3	6
627	 - Should I-- - I beg your pardon, my lady.	51	3	6
628	 Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion.	51	3	6
629	 I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding.	51	3	6
630	 Yes, it should be quite a wedding.	51	3	6
631	 I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa.	51	3	6
632	 Of course.	51	3	6
633	 Alone, if I may.	51	3	6
634	 Why do you need to speak to her alone?	51	3	6
635	 Shae.	51	3	6
636	 Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion.	51	3	6
637	 She's not from here.	51	3	6
638	 But I trust her,	51	3	6
639	 even though she tells me not to.	51	3	6
640	 Sometimes we think we want to hear something	51	3	6
641	 and it's only afterwards when it's too late	51	3	6
642	 that we realize we wished we'd heard it	51	3	6
643	 under entirely different circumstances.	52	3	6
644	 It's all right, really.	52	3	6
645	 How to begin?	52	3	6
646	 It's-- this--	52	3	6
647	 this-- this is awkward.	52	3	6
648	 1,000 blades	52	3	6
649	 taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies,	52	3	6
650	 forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread.	52	3	6
651	 There aren't 1,000 blades.	52	3	6
652	 There aren't even 200.	52	3	6
653	 I've counted.	52	3	6
654	 Ha, I'm sure you have.	52	3	6
655	 Ugly old thing.	52	3	6
656	 Yet it has a certain appeal.	52	3	6
657	 The Lysa Arryn of chairs.	52	3	6
658	 Shame you had to settle for your second choice.	52	3	6
659	 Early days, my friend.	52	3	6
660	 It is flattering, really...	52	3	6
661	 you feeling such dread	53	3	6
662	 at the prospect of me getting what I want.	53	3	6
663	 Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition,	53	3	6
664	 I promise you.	53	3	6
665	 Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?	53	3	6
666	 You're so right.	53	3	6
667	 For instance,	53	3	6
668	 when I thwarted your plan	53	3	6
669	 to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells.	53	3	6
670	 If I'm going to be honest,	53	3	6
671	 I did feel an unmistakable sense	53	3	6
672	 of enjoyment there.	53	3	6
673	 But your confidant,	53	3	6
674	 the one who fed you information about my plans,	53	3	6
675	 the one you swore to protect...	53	3	6
676	 you didn't bring her any enjoyment.	53	3	6
677	 And she didn't bring me any enjoyment.	53	3	6
678	 She was a bad investment on my part.	53	3	6
679	 Luckily, I have a friend	54	3	6
680	 who wanted to try something new.	54	3	6
681	 Something daring.	54	3	6
682	 And he was so grateful to me for providing	54	3	6
683	 this fresh experience.	54	3	6
684	 I did what I did for the good of the realm.	54	3	6
685	 The realm?	54	3	6
686	 Do you know what the realm is?	54	3	6
687	 It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies.	54	3	6
688	 A story we agree to tell each other over and over	54	3	6
689	 till we forget that it's a lie.	54	3	6
690	 But what do we have left once we abandon the lie?	54	3	6
691	 Chaos.	54	3	6
692	 A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.	54	3	6
693	 Chaos isn't a pit.	54	3	6
694	 Chaos is a ladder.	55	3	6
695	 Many who try to climb it fail	55	3	6
696	 and never get to try again.	55	3	6
697	 The fall breaks them.	55	3	6
698	 And some are given a chance to climb,	55	3	6
699	 but they refuse.	55	3	6
700	 They cling to the realm	55	3	6
701	 or the gods	55	3	6
702	 or love.	55	3	6
703	 Illusions.	55	3	6
704	 Only the ladder is real.	55	3	6
705	 The climb is all there is.	55	3	6
0	 In old times, whenever Braavos stood in danger,	3	5	2
1	 the Titan would step with fire in its eyes,	3	5	2
2	 wade into the sea and smash the enemies.	4	5	2
3	 It's just a statue.	4	5	2
4	 Haha. Don't be afraid. He's announcing our arrival.	4	5	2
5	 I'm not afraid.	4	5	2

7	 This is where you'll find the man you seek.	5	5	2
8	 Here, I leave you.	5	5	2
9	 - Thank you for bringing me. - Any man in Braavos would have done the same.	6	5	2
10	 - Valar morghulis. - Valar dohaeris.	6	5	2
11	 Hello.	6	5	2
12	 Valar morghulis.	6	5	2
13	 Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.	7	5	2
14	 - No one here by that name. - Please!	7	5	2
15	 I've crossed the narrow sea. I have nowhere else to go.	7	5	2
16	 - You have everywhere else to go. - But wait!	7	5	2
17	 Cersei...Walder Frey...	7	5	2
18	 The Mountain...Meryn Trant.	7	5	2
19	 Cersei...Walder Frey...	8	5	2
20	 The Mountain...Meryn Trant.	8	5	2
21	 Cersei...	8	5	2
22	 Walder Frey...	8	5	2
23	 The Mountain...	8	5	2
24	 Meryn Trant.	8	5	2
25	 Cersei...	8	5	2
26	 Walder Frey...	8	5	2
27	 The Mountain...	8	5	2
28	 Meryn Trant.	8	5	2
29	 Cersei...	8	5	2
30	 Walder Frey...	8	5	2
31	 The Mountain...	8	5	2
32	 Meryn Trant...	8	5	2
33	 Must be good food if it's crowded.	9	5	2
34	 Ale?	9	5	2
35	 Ale?	9	5	2
36	 Before we left, a maester gave you a raven's scroll.	9	5	2
37	 You are becoming an observant young lady.	9	5	2
38	" My mother used to say ""dark wings dark words""."	9	5	2
39	 An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.	9	5	2
40	 So it's good news.	10	5	2
41	 My marriage proposal has been accepted.	10	5	2
42	 I thought you still mourned the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.	10	5	2
43	 - Ale? - I'll have some.	10	5	2
44	 My Lady...	10	5	2
45	 - What is it? - Sansa Stark. Don't look!	10	5	2
46	 You sure?	10	5	2
47	 She's dyed her hair, but it's her.	10	5	2
48	 She's sitting with Petyr Baelish.	10	5	2
49	 Littlefinger?	10	5	2
50	 A bunch of knights with them.	10	5	2
51	 Bunch? Bunch...Six? Twenty?	10	5	2
52	 Ten, I think. Too many.	10	5	2
53	 My Lady, I don't think this is...	10	5	2
54	 Ready the horses!	10	5	2
55	 We only have one horse.	10	5	2
56	 Find more!	10	5	2
57	 Do you like the taste?	10	5	2
58	 Don't see what all the fuss is about.	10	5	2
59	 Why do men love it so much?	10	5	2
60	 It gives some men courage.	10	5	2
61	 Does it give you courage?	11	5	2
62	 That's far enough.	11	5	2
63	 Lord Baelish.	11	5	2
64	 Lady Sansa.	11	5	2
65	 My name is Brienne of Tarth.	11	5	2
66	 We've met, with Renly Baratheon.	11	5	2
67	 What did he say about you?	11	5	2
68	 He said,	11	5	2
69	 Your loyalty came free of charge.	11	5	2
70	 Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then.	11	5	2
71	 Lady Sansa.	11	5	2
72	 Before your mother's death,	11	5	2
73	 I was her sworn sword.	11	5	2
74	 I gave my word I will find you and protect you.	11	5	2
75	 I will shield your back	11	5	2
76	 and keep your counsel,	11	5	2
77	 and give my life for you if needs be.	12	5	2
78	 I swear it by the Old Gods and the New.	12	5	2
79	 Please, lady Brienne.	12	5	2
80	 No need for such formality.	12	5	2
81	 You were Catelyn Stark's sworn sword.	12	5	2
82	 - I was. - Strange.	12	5	2
83	 I knew Cat since the time we were children. She never mentioned you.	12	5	2
84	 It was after Renly's murder.	12	5	2
85	 Ah, yes.	12	5	2
86	 You were accused of killing him.	12	5	2
87	 I tried to save him.	12	5	2
88	 - But you were accused. - By men who did not see what happened.	12	5	2
89	 And what did happen?	12	5	2
90	 He was murdered by a shadow.	12	5	2
91	 A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon.	12	5	2
92	 A shadow?	12	5	2
93	 With a face?	12	5	2
94	 This woman swore to protect Renly,	12	5	2
95	 she failed.	12	5	2
96	 She swore to protect your mother,	12	5	2
97	 she failed.	12	5	2
98	 Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guarding Lady Sansa?	12	5	2
99	 Why should you have any say in her affairs?	13	5	2
100	 Because I am her uncle.	13	5	2
101	 I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my beloved's untimely death.	13	5	2
102	 We're family now. And you are an outsider.	13	5	2
103	 Forgive me, Lady Brienne.	13	5	2
104	 But experience has made me wary of outsiders.	13	5	2
105	 Lady Sansa...	13	5	2
106	 - if we can have a word alone... - No.	13	5	2
107	 - Please, my Lady, if I can explain... - I saw you at Joffrey's wedding...	13	5	2
108	 bowing to the king.	13	5	2
109	 Neither of us wanted to be there.	13	5	2
110	 - Sometimes we don't have a choice. - And sometimes we do.	13	5	2
111	 You should leave.	13	5	2
112	 We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone.	13	5	2
113	 The roads in these parts aren't safe.	13	5	2
114	 Why don't you stay?	13	5	2
115	 I'm gonna ask you to stay.	13	5	2
116	 Stop! Stop! After him!	14	5	2
117	 Podrick!	14	5	2
118	 Stop, stop, stop, stop!	15	5	2
119	 Stop!	15	5	2
120	 That's a good boy. Come on.	15	5	2
121	 Come on!	15	5	2
122	 No, no, no, stop!	15	5	2
123	 Guess that means you're unarmed.	16	5	2
124	 Don't! Put that down!	16	5	2
125	 Podrick?	16	5	2
126	 Yes, my Lady?	16	5	2
127	 You can stand now.	16	5	2
128	 Yes, my Lady.	16	5	2
129	 Sansa Stark?	16	5	2
130	 Wary of strangers, as she should be.	16	5	2
131	 I saw her riding on the Eastroad with Littlefinger.	16	5	2
132	 - We'll follow them. - My Lady...	17	5	2
133	 if both Stark girls refused your service,	17	5	2
134	 maybe you're released from your vow.	17	5	2
135	 I swore to their mother I would protect those girls.	17	5	2
136	 They don't want your protection.	17	5	2
137	 You think she's safe with Littlefinger?	17	5	2
138	 No, my Lady.	17	5	2
139	 Get your horse.	17	5	2
140	 A summons from the Queen.	17	5	2
141	 There are only two like it in the world.	17	5	2
142	 The one I'm wearing and the one I gave to Myrcella.	17	5	2
143	 It's a threat.	17	5	2
144	 Of course it's a threat.	18	5	2
145	 Our daughter is alone in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family.	18	5	2
146	 It's a threat,	18	5	2
147	 No note?	18	5	2
148	 They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister.	18	5	2
149	 And every other tragedy that	18	5	2
150	 has befallen their accursed country.	18	5	2
151	 I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her.	18	5	2
152	 Softer.	18	5	2
153	 What?	18	5	2
154	 Not so loud.	18	5	2
155	 Our daughter is in danger and you're worried I am speaking too loudly?	18	5	2
156	 No one can know she's our daughter.	18	5	2
157	 Then don't call her your daughter.	18	5	2
158	 You've never been a father to her.	18	5	2
159	 If I was a father to any of my children, they'd be stoned in the streets.	18	5	2
160	 And what has your caution brought?	18	5	2
161	 Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding,	18	5	2
162	 our only daughter shipped off to Dorne,	18	5	2
163	 our baby boy set to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden!	18	5	2
164	 I'm gonna make things better.	19	5	2
165	 You've never made anything better.	19	5	2
166	 I'm going to Dorne.	19	5	2
167	 And I'm bringing our daughter home.	19	5	2
168	 You can't just ask Prince Doran to give her back.	19	5	2
169	 She's promised to his son.	19	5	2
170	 I'm not going to ask him anything.	19	5	2
171	 You go down there with an army it's an act of war.	19	5	2
172	 No army.	19	5	2
173	 Do you know where they're keeping her?	19	5	2
174	 Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.	19	5	2
175	 I'll find her.	19	5	2
176	 Is there anything else, Your Grace?	19	5	2
177	 You're going to Dorne.	19	5	2
178	 A one-handed man.	19	5	2
179	 Alone.	19	5	2
180	 Who said I was going alone?	19	5	2
181	 No sunflowers. I don't like yellow.	20	5	2
182	 Roses are very nice, definitely roses.	20	5	2
183	 And music. I adore music.	20	5	2
184	 But no flutes.	20	5	2
185	 I hate flutes. We can have a harp, if you like, but no flutes.	20	5	2
186	 Then there's the food.	20	5	2
187	 The food is the most important thing, don't you agree?	20	5	2
188	 We're gonna need pigeon pies.	20	5	2
189	 That's what they eat in the capital, don't they?	20	5	2
190	 Don't they?	20	5	2
191	 Don't who?	20	5	2
192	 People eat pigeon pie in the capital.	20	5	2
193	 They certainly do, my dear.	20	5	2
194	 They certainly do.	20	5	2
195	 It's a fine place, isn't it?	20	5	2
196	 A fine place.	20	5	2
197	 I never thought I'd end up settling down in a place like this.	20	5	2
198	 You won't.	20	5	2
199	 Pardon?	20	5	2
200	 We won't get to live at Stokeworth.	20	5	2
201	 When mother dies, my sister gets the castle because she's older.	20	5	2
202	 She hates me.	20	5	2
203	 She calls me mean names and sometimes	21	5	2
204	 even still she pulls my hair when mother's not looking.	21	5	2
205	 You know what I think?	21	5	2
206	 I think you're a good person.	21	5	2
207	 And your sister is a mean person.	21	5	2
208	 She is.	21	5	2
209	 I've been all over the world	21	5	2
210	 and if there's one thing I've learned,	21	5	2
211	 is that meanness comes around.	21	5	2
212	 People like your sister,	21	5	2
213	 they always get what's coming for them, eventually.	21	5	2
214	 One way or another.	21	5	2
215	 Who's that?	21	5	2
216	 Jaime fucking Lannister.	21	5	2
217	 Ser Jaime?	21	5	2
218	 Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.	21	5	2
219	 I was very sorry to hear about your father.	21	5	2
220	 Thank you.	21	5	2
221	 This is my betrothed, Lollys.	21	5	2
222	 A pleasure.	22	5	2
223	 Run along, love.	22	5	2
224	 Beautiful young bride you've chosen.	22	5	2
225	 When are you planning on getting married?	22	5	2
226	 Just get on with it.	22	5	2
227	 On with what?	22	5	2
228	 What you're here for.	22	5	2
229	 There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.	22	5	2
230	 It's very good for you.	22	5	2
231	 Lollys will be marrying Ser Willys Bracken.	22	5	2
232	 Mmm.	22	5	2
233	 We've made a deal, your sister and I.	22	5	2
234	 I would have advised against that.	22	5	2
235	 How is this good for me?	22	5	2
236	 Because you're going to come with me and help me with something important.	22	5	2
237	 And when we return...	22	5	2
238	 I'm gonna give you a much better girl and a much better castle.	22	5	2
239	 Return from where?	23	5	2
240	 As far south as south goes.	23	5	2
241	 You are my queen.	23	5	2
242	 The prince does not wish to be disturbed.	23	5	2
243	 Remove yourself from my path	23	5	2
244	 or I'll take that long axe and I'll shove it up your...	23	5	2
245	 Captain...	23	5	2
246	 let her pass.	23	5	2
247	 Your brother was murdered...	24	5	2
248	 and you sit here in the Water Gardens	24	5	2
249	 staring at the sky and doing nothing.	24	5	2
250	 Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat	24	5	2
251	 by law, that is no murder.	24	5	2
252	 - Your brother... - You don't have to remind me.	24	5	2
253	 He was my brother long before he was anything to you.	24	5	2
254	 What will you know about his death?	24	5	2
255	 I will bury him. I will mourn for him.	24	5	2
256	 And then?	24	5	2
257	 You would have me go to war.	24	5	2
258	 The whole country would have you go to war.	24	5	2
259	 Then we are lucky the whole country does not decide.	24	5	2
260	 The Sand Snakes are with me.	24	5	2
261	 They have the love of their people.	24	5	2
262	 They will avenge their father	24	5	2
263	 while you sit here in your chair doing nothing.	24	5	2
264	 Oberyn is dead.	24	5	2
265	 And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens	24	5	2
266	 eating our food, breathing our air.	24	5	2
267	 How many of your brothers and sisters	25	5	2
268	 do they have to kill?	25	5	2
269	 Let me have her.	25	5	2
270	 Let me send her to Cersei one finger at a time.	25	5	2
271	 I loved my brother.	25	5	2
272	 And you made him very happy.	25	5	2
273	 For that, you will always have a place in my heart.	25	5	2
274	 But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance.	25	5	2
275	 Not here.	25	5	2
276	 Not while I rule.	25	5	2
277	 And how long would that be?	25	5	2
278	 The Unsullied are too conspicuous.	25	5	2
279	 Anyone can see them coming from a mile off.	25	5	2
280	 'Course you haven't found any Sons of the Harpy.	26	5	2
281	 You haven't, have you?	26	5	2
282	 My Second Sons on the other hand...	26	5	2
283	 they drink, they whore, fight in streets,	26	5	2
284	 they blend in.	26	5	2
285	 They overhear things in taverns.	26	5	2
286	 Follow people from the taverns to nice quiet alleys.	26	5	2
287	 Break a few fingers, overhear a few more things...	26	5	2
288	 before you know it...	26	5	2
289	 No one here.	26	5	2
290	 We go.	26	5	2
291	 In a hurry?	26	5	2
292	 You're afraid?	27	5	2
293	 Unsullied fear nothing.	27	5	2
294	 Right.	27	5	2
295	 That's your problem.	27	5	2
296	 You understood fear once, long ago, but you forgot what it means.	27	5	2
297	 Someone who's forgotten fear...	27	5	2
298	 has forgotten how to hide.	27	5	2
299	 Fear is useful that way.	27	5	2
300	 Sons of the Harpy...	27	5	2
301	 they want to put a collar back on my neck.	27	5	2
302	 On all of our necks. Please, Your Grace...	28	5	2
303	 - you must kill him. - It would send a message.	28	5	2
304	 I think you should exercise restraint...	28	5	2
305	 - Your Grace. - Why?	28	5	2
306	 Well, for one thing, he may have valuable information.	28	5	2
307	 Well, the Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.	28	5	2
308	 How do you know that?	28	5	2
309	 Because I questioned him.	28	5	2
310	 And the information you did get... he is young and..	28	5	2
311	 He is born free.	28	5	2
312	 Why should he want to bring back slavery?	28	5	2
313	 What did it do for him?	28	5	2
314	 Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride	28	5	2
315	 was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.	28	5	2
316	 They pay him.	28	5	2
317	 Great families, afraid to do a thing.	28	5	2
318	 They pay poor men to do it for them.	28	5	2
319	 And how do you know this?	28	5	2
320	 - Everyone know this. - I don't know it.	28	5	2
321	 And I'm the head of a great family.	28	5	2
322	 We do not know what this man did or didn't do.	28	5	2
323	 Give him a trial at least.	28	5	2
324	 A fair trial.	28	5	2
325	 Show all the citizens of Meereen	28	5	2
326	 that you are better than those who would depose you.	28	5	2
327	 Teach them a better way.	28	5	2
328	 I do not know the place from where old ser comes.	28	5	2
329	 Things maybe are different there, I hope.	28	5	2
330	 But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn	28	5	2
331	 they own us.	29	5	2
332	 So we learn much about them...	29	5	2
333	 or we do not live long.	29	5	2
334	 They teach me what they are.	29	5	2
335	 Mercy, fair trial...	29	5	2
336	 these mean nothing to them.	29	5	2
337	 All they understand is blood.	29	5	2
338	 Thank you all for your council.	29	5	2
339	 Your Grace...	29	5	2
340	 a word, please, I beg you.	29	5	2
341	 About what?	29	5	2
342	 About your father.	29	5	2
343	 - About the Mad King. - The Mad King?	29	5	2
344	 You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies?	29	5	2
345	 Consider me reminded.	29	5	2
346	 Your Grace...	29	5	2
347	 I served in his Kingsguard.	29	5	2
348	 I was at his side from the first.	29	5	2
349	 Your enemies did not lie.	29	5	2
350	 Go on.	29	5	2
351	 When the people rose and revolted against him	30	5	2
352	 your father set their tongues cast them in flames.	30	5	2
353	 He murdered sons in front of their fathers.	30	5	2
354	 He burned men alive with wildfire	30	5	2
355	 and laughed as they screamed,	30	5	2
356	 and his efforts to stamp out dissent	30	5	2
357	 led to a rebellion that killed every Targaryen...	30	5	2
358	 except two.	30	5	2
359	 I'm not my father.	30	5	2
360	 No, Your Grace, thank the gods.	30	5	2
361	 But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved.	30	5	2
362	 And each time, it made him feel powerful...	30	5	2
363	 and right...	30	5	2
364	 until the very end.	30	5	2
365	 I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial.	30	5	2
366	 Your Grace.	30	5	2
367	 There's a bug.	31	5	2
368	 Yes, best be careful.	31	5	2
369	 You might accidentally consume some solid food.	31	5	2
370	 When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions?	31	5	2
371	 Besides, what else is there for me to do inside this fucking box?	31	5	2
372	 - You don't like it? - I want to take a walk.	31	5	2
373	 You can't.	31	5	2
374	 Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.	31	5	2
375	 She ought to offer her cunt.	31	5	2
376	 Best part of her for the best part of me.	31	5	2
377	 Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere.	31	5	2
378	 Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis	31	5	2
379	 talking about the futility of everything.	31	5	2
380	 You're right, there's no point.	31	5	2
381	 The road to Volantis?	31	5	2
382	 You said we are going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?	31	5	2
383	 The road to Meereen.	32	5	2
384	 And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?	32	5	2
385	 I told you. A ruler.	32	5	2
386	 But you've already got a ruler.	32	5	2
387	 Everywhere has already got a ruler.	32	5	2
388	 Every pile of shit on the side of every road	32	5	2
389	 has someone's banner hanging from it.	32	5	2
390	 You are quite good, do you know?	32	5	2
391	 At ruling.	32	5	2
392	 During your brief tenure as Hand.	32	5	2
393	 I didn't rule, I was a servant.	32	5	2
394	 Still, a man of talent.	32	5	2
395	 Managed to kill a lot of people?	32	5	2
396	 Yes, but you showed great promise in other areas as well.	32	5	2
397	 She wanted me to leave King's Landing.	32	5	2
398	 She begged me.	32	5	2
399	 I wouldn't go.	32	5	2
400	 Why?	32	5	2
401	 'Cause I liked it.	32	5	2
402	 Power...	32	5	2
403	 even as a servant.	32	5	2
404	 People follow leaders	32	5	2
405	 and they will never follow us.	33	5	2
406	 They find us repulsive.	33	5	2
407	 I find us repulsive.	33	5	2
408	 And we find them... repulsive, which is why	33	5	2
409	 we surround ourselves with large comfortable boxes	33	5	2
410	 to keep them away.	33	5	2
411	 And yet...	33	5	2
412	 no matter what we do...	33	5	2
413	 people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box.	33	5	2
414	 Not for long.	33	5	2
415	 You're right.	33	5	2
416	 - Let's go for a walk. - No.	33	5	2
417	 How many dwarves are there in the world?	33	5	2
418	 Is Cersei going to kill them all?	33	5	2
419	 Not him.	33	5	2
420	 You're trying to deceive your queen?	33	5	2
421	 Should I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?	33	5	2
422	 It won't be necessary, Ser Meryn.	33	5	2
423	 I don't want to dissuade the other hunters.	33	5	2
424	 Mistakes will be made.	33	5	2
425	 - Thank you, Your Grace. - Thanks.	33	5	2
426	 - Thank you, Your Grace. - Thank you.	33	5	2
427	 Take the head.	33	5	2
428	 Let me, Your Grace.	33	5	2
429	 I would take it if you don't mind.	34	5	2
430	 It could prove useful for my work.	34	5	2
431	 Very good.	34	5	2
432	 Over there would be fine.	34	5	2
433	 You heard the man, over there.	34	5	2
434	 You're the hand of the King.	34	5	2
435	 No, uncle.	34	5	2
436	 Clearly, it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role.	34	5	2
437	 I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself.	34	5	2
438	 Your Grace, I would be willing to serve provisionally as the King's Hand	34	5	2
439	 - until he becomes full... - You're a good man, Lord Tyrell,	35	5	2
440	 but I don't imagine we'll have the time.	35	5	2
441	 In addition to be Master of Ships,	35	5	2
442	 the King has appointed you Master of Coin.	35	5	2
443	 Oh, Your Grace.	35	5	2
444	 He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled.	35	5	2
445	 He said he would be honored to have you represent the Crown's interest in the same.	35	5	2
446	 The honor is all mine, Your Grace.	35	5	2
447	 Y-Y-Your Grace, in the past, on several occasions,	35	5	2
448	 a Grand Maester has served as the King's Hand.	35	5	2
449	 The King's named Qyburn the new Master of Whispers.	35	5	2
450	 Your Grace,	35	5	2
451	 this-this man? Th-This embarassment to the Citadel?	35	5	2
452	 Your Grace...	35	5	2
453	 what qualifications can he possibly have for this post?	35	5	2
454	 The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester.	35	5	2
455	 That's far more than the eunuch ever had.	35	5	2
456	 Far more than many ever have.	36	5	2
457	 I must say... I can not...	36	5	2
458	 Uncle Kevan,	36	5	2
459	 in light of your position as Commander of the Lannister Armies,	36	5	2
460	 it would please the King if you would serve as his Master of War.	36	5	2
461	 No man living better deserves the title.	36	5	2
462	 That is kind of you to say.	36	5	2
463	 I would like to hear it from the King himself.	36	5	2
464	 Well, the King is very busy at this moment.	36	5	2
465	 He should be here, learning what it means to rule.	36	5	2
466	 He is learning.	36	5	2
467	 On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler,	36	5	2
468	 he's asked me to speak on his behalf.	36	5	2
469	 I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother,	36	5	2
470	 and to you,	36	5	2
471	 and to serve the King.	36	5	2
472	 I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet.	36	5	2
473	 To watch you stack the Small Council with sycophants.	36	5	2
474	 Sending your own brother away...	36	5	2
475	 My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.	36	5	2
476	 What mission?	36	5	2
477	 That is not your concern as Master of War.	36	5	2
478	 I do not recognize your authority to dictate	37	5	2
479	 what is and is not my concern.	37	5	2
480	 You are the Queen Mother.	37	5	2
481	 Nothing more.	37	5	2
482	 You would abandon your king in his time of need?	37	5	2
483	 If he wants to send for me, I'll be waiting for him.	37	5	2
484	 At Casterly Rock.	37	5	2
485	 Come on, you know this one.	37	5	2
486	 It looks like an animal.	37	5	2
487	 Snake.	37	5	2
488	" S-S-Sn... ""S""."	37	5	2
489	" - It's an ""S"". - Right, very good."	37	5	2
490	 Hmm, did you know	37	5	2
491	 that the youngest Lord Commander in history,	37	5	2
492	 Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10?	37	5	2
493	" I know ""S""."	37	5	2
494	 You'll learn, I promise.	38	5	2
495	 I taught Ser Davos.	38	5	2
496	 Old people are terrible at learning new things.	38	5	2
497	 Well, you are a wonderful teacher.	38	5	2
498	 Very patient.	38	5	2
499	 I only said that the more time that you spend practicing	38	5	2
500	 the faster you will be able to read.	38	5	2
501	 That's all right.	38	5	2
502	 We're doing just fine.	38	5	2
503	 I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about.	38	5	2
504	 How old were you when you learned how to read?	38	5	2
505	 - 3. - 3?	38	5	2
506	 Were you taught by your mother?	38	5	2
507	 No.	38	5	2
508	 Our Maester Cressen did.	38	5	2
509	 I had a lot of time to practice. My mother kept me inside because...	38	5	2
510	 What do you call it in the south? What happened to your face.	38	5	2
511	 Grayscale.	38	5	2
512	 What would you call it in the north of the Wall?	38	5	2
513	 I don't know.	38	5	2
514	 But two of my sisters had it. They both died.	38	5	2
515	 How did they cure you?	38	5	2
516	 I don't remember. I was a baby.	39	5	2
517	 A lot of people came and tried, I think.	39	5	2
518	 Whatever they did, it went away.	39	5	2
519	 What happened to your sisters?	39	5	2
520	 My father made them move out to the keep, outside.	39	5	2
521	 None of us were allowed to go near them.	39	5	2
522	 But we heard them, especially at night.	39	5	2
523	 They started to sound not like themselves.	39	5	2
524	 Did you ever see them?	39	5	2
525	 Only once, at the end.	39	5	2
526	 They were covered with it.	39	5	2
527	 Their faces, their arms, they acted like animals.	39	5	2
528	 My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope.	39	5	2
529	 What did he do with them in the woods?	39	5	2
530	 Mother.	40	5	2
531	 Leave us.	40	5	2
532	 Your Grace.	40	5	2
533	 You need to stay away from that girl.	40	5	2
534	 - Why? - She's a wildling.	40	5	2
535	 Her name's Gilly.	40	5	2
536	 She's nice. I'm teaching her to read.	40	5	2
537	 She's a wildling. Your father defeated her people.	40	5	2
538	 He executed their king for treason.	40	5	2
539	 They could strike at him by striking at you.	40	5	2
540	 Gilly wouldn't do that.	40	5	2
541	 You have no idea what people will do.	40	5	2
542	 All your books and you still don't know.	40	5	2
543	 I ordered Mance Rayder burned at the stake.	40	5	2
544	 You prevented that order from being carried out.	40	5	2
545	 You showed mercy to Mance Rayder.	40	5	2
546	 The King's word is law.	40	5	2
547	 Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers.	40	5	2
548	 Show too much kindness, people won't fear you.	41	5	2
549	 If they don't fear you, they don't follow you.	41	5	2
550	 With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you	41	5	2
551	 no matter what you do.	41	5	2
552	 You're the man who burned their king alive.	41	5	2
553	 Who then?	41	5	2
554	 You?	41	5	2
555	 No. Only one of their own.	41	5	2
556	 Do you know this wretched girl?	41	5	2
557	 - Lyanna Mormont. - Lord Commander's niece.	41	5	2
558	 Lady of Bear Island.	41	5	2
559	 And a child of ten.	41	5	2
560	 I asked her to commit her house to my court. That's her response.	41	5	2
561	 Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North,	41	5	2
562	 whose name is Stark.	41	5	2
563	 That amuses you.	41	5	2
564	 I apologize, Your Grace.	41	5	2
565	 Northerners commit a bit like the free folk.	41	5	2
566	 Loyal to their own.	42	5	2
567	 I know.	42	5	2
568	 My brother, Robert, went on often and loudly about how difficult it was	42	5	2
569	 to control them.	42	5	2
570	 Even with your father's help.	42	5	2
571	 Tonight, the Night's Watch elect a new Lord Commander.	42	5	2
572	 Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win.	42	5	2
573	 - Most likely. - One pleasant man.	42	5	2
574	 He thinks you're a traitor.	42	5	2
575	 What's your life gonna be like here at the Wall,	42	5	2
576	 - with Thorne in command? - Unpleasant, I expect.	42	5	2
577	 Your bravery made him look weak.	42	5	2
578	 He'll punish you for it.	42	5	2
579	 I don't punish men for bravery.	42	5	2
580	 I reward them.	42	5	2
581	 I don't doubt that, Your Grace.	42	5	2
582	 But I am a brother of the Night's Watch.	42	5	2
583	 I have pledged them my life, my honor, my sword.	42	5	2
584	 I don't know what I have left to give you.	42	5	2
585	 You can give me the North.	42	5	2
586	 I can't.	42	5	2
587	 Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard.	43	5	2
588	 A Snow.	43	5	2
589	 Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet.	43	5	2
590	 Pledge me your service and you'll rise again as Jon Stark,	43	5	2
591	 Lord of Winterfell.	43	5	2
592	 He'll make you a Stark with a stroke of a pen.	43	5	2
593	 It's the first thing I ever remember wanting.	43	5	2
594	 I daydreamed that my father would ask the king.	43	5	2
595	 Just like that I would never be the Bastard of Winterfell again.	43	5	2
596	 No, you deserve that. You do.	43	5	2
597	 I-I couldn't be happier for you.	43	5	2
598	 I'm gonna refuse him.	43	5	2
599	 But...	43	5	2
600	 you'd be Lord of Winterfell.	43	5	2
601	 I swore a vow to the Night's Watch.	43	5	2
602	 If I don't take my own word seriously,	43	5	2
603	 what sort of Lord of Winterfell would that be?	43	5	2
604	 Hey.	43	5	2
605	 Crowded, You'd think we were serving venison stew.	44	5	2
606	 Does anyone wish to speak for candidates...	44	5	2
607	 before we cast our tokens...	44	5	2
608	 for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?	44	5	2
609	 Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight,	44	5	2
610	 he's a man of true nobility.	44	5	2
611	 He was Acting Commander when the Wall came under attack	44	5	2
612	 and led us to victory against the wildlings.	44	5	2
613	 Yes.	44	5	2
614	 He's a veteran of 100 battles	44	5	2
615	 and has been a defender of the Watch and the Wall almost all of his life.	44	5	2
616	 Nice.	44	5	2
617	 - He's the only true choice. - Yes.	44	5	2
618	 Yes.	44	5	2
619	 Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy	44	5	2
620	 and has served loyally longer than any other Ranger.	44	5	2
621	 - That's right. - Through ten winters he served.	44	5	2
622	 As Commander of the Shadow Tower...	45	5	2
623	 he kept the wildlings away.	45	5	2
624	 We could do no better.	45	5	2
625	 If there's no one else...	45	5	2
626	 we will begin the voting.	45	5	2
627	 The triangular tokens count for Ser Alliser Thorne.	45	5	2
628	 The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister.	45	5	2
629	 Maester Aemon...	45	5	2
630	 Samwell Tarly, go on.	45	5	2
631	 Sam the Slayer.	45	5	2
632	 Another wildling lover, just like his friend, Jon Snow.	45	5	2
633	 How's your lady love, Slayer?	45	5	2
634	 Her name is Gilly.	45	5	2
635	 Ser Slynt knows her quite well.	45	5	2
636	 They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall.	45	5	2
637	 Lies!	45	5	2
638	 A wildling girl, a baby,	45	5	2
639	 and Lord Janos.	45	5	2
640	 I found him there after the battle was over.	46	5	2
641	 In a puddle of his own making.	46	5	2
642	 Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children	46	5	2
643	 Jon Snow was leading.	46	5	2
644	 Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true,	46	5	2
645	 but when he was wounded, it was Jon who saved us.	46	5	2
646	 He took charge of the Wall's defense,	46	5	2
647	 he killed the Magnar of the Thenns,	46	5	2
648	 he went North to deal with Mance Rayder.	46	5	2
649	 Knowing it would almost certainly mean his own death.	46	5	2
650	 Before that,	46	5	2
651	 he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont.	46	5	2
652	 Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward.	46	5	2
653	 He saw something in Jon.	46	5	2
654	 And now we've all seen it too.	46	5	2
655	 He may be young,	46	5	2
656	 but he's the commander we turned to	46	5	2
657	 when the night was darkest.	46	5	2
658	 Yeah!	47	5	2
659	 Aye.	47	5	2
660	 Can't argue with any of that.	47	5	2
661	 But who does Jon Snow want to command?	47	5	2
662	 The Night's Watch?	47	5	2
663	 Or the wildlings?	47	5	2
664	 Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl.	47	5	2
665	 He spoke with Mance Rayder many times.	47	5	2
666	 What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends	47	5	2
667	 if Stannis's army hadn't come along?	47	5	2
668	 We all saw him put the King-Beyond-the-Wall out of his misery.	47	5	2
669	 Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life	47	5	2
670	 or a man who makes love to them?	47	5	2
671	 It is time!	47	5	2
672	 Appears to be a tie, maester.	48	5	2
673	 Jon Snow! Jon Snow!	49	5	2
674	 Jon Snow! Jon Snow!	49	5	2
675	 Jon Snow! Jon Snow!	49	5	2
676	 You! You!	49	5	2
677	 What have you got there?	49	5	2
678	 - I said... - Turn around and go!	50	5	2
679	 Turn around...	50	5	2
680	 - and go! - That's a nice little sword.	50	5	2
681	 Worth a hundred pigeons a sword like that.	50	5	2
682	 Nothing's worth anything to dead men.	50	5	2
683	 Quickly, go! Go!	50	5	2
684	 Who are you?	50	5	2
685	 Why were they scared of you?	50	5	2
686	 You lost this.	50	5	2
687	 You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.	50	5	2
688	 There isn't.	51	5	2
689	 A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.	51	5	2
690	 Who are you then?	51	5	2
691	 No one.	51	5	2
692	 And that is who a girl must become.	51	5	2

12	 ( Grunting )	3	2	7
13	 ( Man groaning )	3	2	7
14	 ( Panting )	3	2	7
15	 Right, get the horses and the hounds.	3	2	7
16	 - ( Dogs barking ) - Come on, find the scent.	3	2	7
17	 Come on, where they going?	3	2	7
18	 Halt!	3	2	7
19	 Enjoying your first hunt?	3	2	7
20	 So far, hunting seems very similar to riding, My Lord.	3	2	7
21	 With hunting, there's blood at the end.	3	2	7
22	 They're little boys.	3	2	7
23	 I was a little boy when I was torn away from	3	2	7
24	 my home and brought here.	4	2	7
25	 So I kept my word.	4	2	7
26	 I never ran away.	4	2	7
27	 If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them.	4	2	7
28	 Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them.	4	2	7
29	 Those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead.	4	2	7
30	 They have no value to me missing.	4	2	7
31	 Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now.	4	2	7
32	 Robb's in the Riverlands. My sister's in Deepwood Motte.	4	2	7
33	 She'll get here long before they do.	4	2	7
34	 And Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold.	4	2	7
35	 Winterfell against 10,000.	4	2	7
36	 - ( Dogs barking ) -  We have a scent!	4	2	7
37	 The hounds have the scent.	4	2	7
38	 Come, Maester, don't look so grim.	4	2	7
39	 It's all just a game.	4	2	7
40	  We should have took more food.	5	2	7
41	 We couldn't risk going to the kitchens.	5	2	7
42	 Those people all love you.	5	2	7
43	 They would have given you whatever you needed.	5	2	7
44	 And if Theon found out, he'd hang them.	5	2	7
45	 - The boy can't survive on walnuts. - I'm fine.	5	2	7
46	 We've been walking since before sunrise.	5	2	7
47	 - Even Hodor will tire. - Hodor.	5	2	7
48	 - Even you, sweet giant. - ( Chuckles ) Hodor.	5	2	7
49	 ( Children shouting )	5	2	7
50	 Wait, I know that farm.	5	2	7
51	 I sent those two Winterfell orphans there.	5	2	7
52	 Jack and Billy.	5	2	7
53	 They'll give us some food.	5	2	7
54	 We can't risk it.	5	2	7
55	 If Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them	5	2	7
56	 until he finds out where we are.	5	2	7
57	 Billy climbs a tree better than anyone.	5	2	7
58	 You've never seen me climb a tree, little man.	5	2	7
59	 They'll be after us with hounds.	5	2	7
60	 We got a good start on them,	5	2	7
61	 but we can't outrun hounds forever.	5	2	7
62	 Did you pull a knife on me in the night?	6	2	7
63	 What's the matter?	6	2	7
64	 Can't be the first time you pressed your bone	6	2	7
65	 against a woman's ass.	6	2	7
66	 Let's move.	6	2	7
67	 Oh, it is the first time.	6	2	7
68	 How old are you, boy?	6	2	7
69	 I'm a man of the Night's Watch.	6	2	7
70	 You're a boy who's never been with a girl.	7	2	7
71	 Don't your stones start to hurt	7	2	7
72	 if your bone never gets...	7	2	7
73	 Don't call them that.	7	2	7
74	 What, stones?	7	2	7
75	 Or bone?	7	2	7
76	 Neither.	7	2	7
77	 Both.	7	2	7
78	 Move!	7	2	7
79	  I heard they get all swollen	7	2	7
80	 and bruised if you don't use them.	7	2	7
81	 Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say	7	2	7
82	 when they want me feeling sorry for them.	7	2	7
83	 As if I'd feel sorry for them.	7	2	7
84	 Are there no girl crows?	7	2	7
85	 There are no women of the Night's Watch, no.	7	2	7
86	 So the lads just do it with each other?	7	2	7
87	 No.	7	2	7
88	 - Never? - Never.	8	2	7
89	 We swore an oath.	8	2	7
90	 You have sheep at the Wall?	8	2	7
91	 With your hands, then?	8	2	7
92	 No wonder you're all so miserable.	8	2	7
93	 Would you please shut up?	8	2	7
94	 ( Mocking ) Would you please shut up?	8	2	7
95	 You think you're better than me, crow.	8	2	7
96	 - I'm a free woman... - You're a free woman?	8	2	7
97	 I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman.	8	2	7
98	 If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman.	8	2	7
99	" That's what ""prisoner"" means."	8	2	7
100	 And you think you're free?	8	2	7
101	 You swore some stupid oath	8	2	7
102	 and now you can never touch a girl.	8	2	7
103	 It was my choice to say the words.	8	2	7
104	 - So you don't like girls? - Of course I like girls.	8	2	7
105	 But you chose never to touch them.	8	2	7
106	 That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.	8	2	7
107	 So instead of getting naked with a girl,	8	2	7
108	 you'd prefer to invade our lands...	8	2	7
109	 Invade your lands?	8	2	7
110	 Wildlings raid our lands all the time.	8	2	7
111	 Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!	8	2	7
112	 They're not your lands!	9	2	7
113	 We've been here the whole time.	9	2	7
114	 You lot came along and just put up a big wall	9	2	7
115	 and said it was yours.	9	2	7
116	 My father was Ned Stark.	9	2	7
117	 I have the blood of the First Men.	9	2	7
118	 My ancestors lived here, same as yours.	9	2	7
119	 So why are you fighting us?	9	2	7
120	 Go on.	9	2	7
121	 Now I want you to tell me what happened.	9	2	7
122	 -  Come on, this way. - ( Man screaming )	9	2	7
123	 Come on, speak up. Speak up.	9	2	7
124	 ( Sniffs )	10	2	7
125	 Wolfsbane...	10	2	7
126	 A rare substance.	10	2	7
127	 This is no common assassin.	10	2	7
128	 We hanged 20 men last night.	10	2	7
129	 I don't care if you hanged 100.	10	2	7
130	 A man tried to kill me.	10	2	7
131	 I want his name and I want his head.	10	2	7
132	  We think it was an infiltrator	10	2	7
133	 from the Brotherhood Without Banners.	10	2	7
134	 Pretentious name for a band of outlaws.	10	2	7
135	 We can't allow rebels behind our lines	10	2	7
136	 to harass us with impunity.	10	2	7
137	 We look like fools and they look like heroes.	10	2	7
138	 That's how kings fall.	10	2	7
139	 I want them dead, every one.	10	2	7
140	 Killing them isn't the problem.	10	2	7
141	 It's finding them.	10	2	7
142	 Have you gone soft, Clegane?	10	2	7
143	 I always thought you had a talent for violence.	10	2	7
144	 Burn the villages, burn the farms.	10	2	7
145	 Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side.	10	2	7
146	 Mmm.	10	2	7
147	 Is that mutton?	10	2	7
148	 Yes, My Lord.	11	2	7
149	 Don't like mutton.	11	2	7
150	 I'll bring something else.	11	2	7
151	 Leave it.	11	2	7
152	 - Are you hungry? - No.	11	2	7
153	 Of course you are.	11	2	7
154	 Eat.	11	2	7
155	 I'll eat in the kitchen later.	11	2	7
156	 It's bad manners to refuse a Lord's offer.	11	2	7
157	 Sit.	11	2	7
158	 Eat.	11	2	7
159	 You're small for your age.	11	2	7
160	 I suppose you've been underfed your whole life.	11	2	7
161	 I eat a lot.	11	2	7
162	 - I just don't grow. - Hmm.	11	2	7
163	 This will be my last war,	11	2	7
164	 win or lose.	11	2	7
165	 Have you ever lost before?	11	2	7
166	 Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?	11	2	7
167	 But this is the one I'll be remembered for.	12	2	7
168	" The ""War of Five Kings"" they're calling it."	12	2	7
169	 My legacy will be determined in the coming months.	12	2	7
170	 Do you know what legacy means?	12	2	7
171	 It's what you pass down to your children	12	2	7
172	 and your children's children.	12	2	7
173	 It's what remains of you when you're gone.	12	2	7
174	 Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy.	12	2	7
175	 The greatest fortress ever built...	12	2	7
176	 The tallest towers, the strongest walls.	12	2	7
177	 The Great Hall had 35 hearths.	12	2	7
178	 35. Can you imagine?	12	2	7
179	 Look at it now...	13	2	7
180	 A blasted ruin.	13	2	7
181	 Do you know what happened?	13	2	7
182	 Dragons?	13	2	7
183	 Yes, dragons happened.	13	2	7
184	 Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land.	13	2	7
185	 A million men could have marched on these walls	13	2	7
186	 and a million men would have been repelled.	13	2	7
187	 But an attack from the air with dragon fire... mm.	13	2	7
188	 Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls.	13	2	7
189	 Aegon Targaryen changed the rules.	13	2	7
190	 That's why every child alive still knows his name	13	2	7
191	 300 years after his death.	13	2	7
192	 Aegon and his sisters.	13	2	7
193	 Mm?	13	2	7
194	 It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon.	13	2	7
195	 It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too.	14	2	7
196	 Correct.	14	2	7
197	 A student of history, are you?	14	2	7
198	 Rhaenys rode Meraxes.	14	2	7
199	 Visenya rode Vhagar.	14	2	7
200	 I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.	14	2	7
201	 Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior.	14	2	7
202	 She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.	14	2	7
203	 Hmm.	14	2	7
204	 She's a heroine of yours, I take it?	14	2	7
205	 Aren't most girls more interested	14	2	7
206	 in the pretty maidens from the songs?	14	2	7
207	 Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?	14	2	7
208	 - Most girls are idiots. - Ha!	14	2	7
209	 You remind me of my daughter.	14	2	7
210	 Where did you learn all this stuff	14	2	7
211	 about Visenya and her Valyrian Steel sword?	14	2	7
212	 From my father.	14	2	7
213	 He was a well-read stonemason.	14	2	7
214	 Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.	15	2	7
215	 Have you met many stonemasons, My Lord?	15	2	7
216	 Careful now, girl.	15	2	7
217	 I enjoy you, but be careful.	15	2	7
218	 Take that back to the kitchen.	15	2	7
219	 Eat what you want.	15	2	7
220	 And, girl.	15	2	7
221	 M'lord.	15	2	7
222	" Lowborn girls say ""M'lord,"""	15	2	7
223	" not ""My Lord."""	15	2	7
224	 If you're going to pose as a commoner,	15	2	7
225	 you should do it properly.	15	2	7
226	 My mother served Lady Dustin	15	2	7
227	 for many years, My Lord.	15	2	7
228	 She taught me how to speak proper... properly.	15	2	7
229	 You're too smart for your own good.	15	2	7
230	 - Has anyone told you that? - Yes.	15	2	7
231	 Go on.	15	2	7
232	 I beg pardon, Ser.	16	2	7
233	 I should have come to you after	16	2	7
234	 to thank you for saving me.	16	2	7
235	 - You were so brave. - Brave?	16	2	7
236	 A dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats.	16	2	7
237	 Does it give you joy to scare people?	16	2	7
238	 No. It gives me joy to kill people.	16	2	7
239	 Spare me. You can't tell me.	16	2	7
240	 Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man.	16	2	7
241	 It was his duty. He never liked it.	16	2	7
242	 Is that what he told you?	16	2	7
243	 He lied.	16	2	7
244	 Killing is the sweetest thing there is.	16	2	7
245	 Why are you always so hateful?	16	2	7
246	 You'll be glad of the hateful things I do	16	2	7
247	 someday when you're queen and I'm all that stands	16	2	7
248	 between you and your beloved king.	16	2	7
249	 I've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen.	17	2	7
250	 One of them did this or knows who did.	17	2	7
251	 You are one of the Thirteen.	17	2	7
252	 If I wanted your dragons, I would have taken them.	17	2	7
253	 - They mean nothing to me on their own. - Nothing?	17	2	7
254	 They're more valuable than anything in the world.	17	2	7
255	 Shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons	17	2	7
256	 would buy me I cannot buy already?	17	2	7
257	 We will get them back.	17	2	7
258	 There is no we,	17	2	7
259	 so why would you help me get them back?	17	2	7
260	 I took you under my protection	17	2	7
261	 in front of the rulers of my city.	17	2	7
262	 A man is what others say he is and no more.	17	2	7
263	 If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar,	17	2	7
264	 my word is worth nothing.	17	2	7
265	 I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof.	17	2	7
266	 But it did happen under your roof.	17	2	7
267	 Khaleesi, many times in my life I have been...	17	2	7
268	 I don't care where you've been.	18	2	7
269	 You think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles.	18	2	7
270	 We can't make steel as good as yours, it's true, but...	18	2	7
271	 We're free.	18	2	7
272	 If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down	18	2	7
273	 as man and woman,	18	2	7
274	 we'd shove a spear up his ass.	18	2	7
275	 We don't go serving some shit king	18	2	7
276	 who's only king because his father was.	18	2	7
277	 No. No, you serve Mance Rayder,	18	2	7
278	 the King-Beyond-the-Wall.	18	2	7
279	 We chose Mance Rayder to lead us.	18	2	7
280	 He was a crow, same as you,	18	2	7
281	 but he wanted to be free.	18	2	7
282	 You could be free, too.	19	2	7
283	 You don't need to live your whole life	19	2	7
284	 taking commands from old men.	19	2	7
285	 Wake up when you want to wake up.	19	2	7
286	 I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt.	19	2	7
287	 Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night.	19	2	7
288	 You're a pretty lad.	19	2	7
289	 The girls would claw each other's eyes out to get naked with you.	19	2	7
290	 Walk.	19	2	7
291	 I could teach you how to do it.	19	2	7
292	 I know how to do it.	19	2	7
293	 You know nothing, Jon Snow.	19	2	7
294	 ( Chatter )	20	2	7
295	 And what did she say?	20	2	7
296	 She admired your spirit, Your Grace.	20	2	7
297	 And what then?	20	2	7
298	 She, uh...	20	2	7
299	 If every man were held accountable	20	2	7
300	 for the actions of every distant relative,	20	2	7
301	 Ser Alton, we'd all hang.	20	2	7
302	 She tore the paper in half, Your Grace.	20	2	7
303	 You've acted with honor.	20	2	7
304	 I thank you for it.	20	2	7
305	 Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's pen is clean.	20	2	7
306	 And give him a hot supper.	20	2	7
307	 Ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace.	20	2	7
308	 The prisoners from the Yellow Fork.	20	2	7
309	 Too many prisoners.	20	2	7
310	 Is there room for Ser Alton?	21	2	7
311	 Does he need to lie down?	21	2	7
312	 Have the men build him a new pen.	21	2	7
313	 Put him in with the Kingslayer for now.	21	2	7
314	 Have your boy watch over them.	21	2	7
315	 Torrhen.	21	2	7
316	 That will be all.	21	2	7
317	 Your Grace.	21	2	7
318	 A minute of your time?	21	2	7
319	 I've been treating your wounded men.	21	2	7
320	 And my enemies as some of my bannermen	21	2	7
321	 are fond of mentioning.	21	2	7
322	 They're not my enemies.	21	2	7
323	 That's what I tell my bannermen.	21	2	7
324	 I've already run through the supplies I brought with me.	21	2	7
325	 Some are easily replaced...	22	2	7
326	 Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses.	22	2	7
327	 But some are not.	22	2	7
328	 I need silk for stitching.	22	2	7
329	 I need fennel root for those with fever, willow bark.	22	2	7
330	 Mostly I need milk of the poppy.	22	2	7
331	 You saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any.	22	2	7
332	 I assume there will be more loss of limb before	22	2	7
333	 this war is over.	22	2	7
334	 - If you need help finding these... - I know where to find them.	22	2	7
335	 I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you.	22	2	7
336	 Continue, My Lady.	22	2	7
337	 You're riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender?	22	2	7
338	 Yes.	22	2	7
339	 The Crag will have a Maester and he will have what I need.	22	2	7
340	 I expect he will.	22	2	7
341	 If I could write a list...	22	2	7
342	 Come with me to the Crag.	22	2	7
343	 I don't think that will be...	22	2	7
344	 Let the Maester show you his stores.	22	2	7
345	 I want the wounded men to be treated well...	23	2	7
346	 All the wounded men.	23	2	7
347	 ( Dog barking )	23	2	7
348	  Children, come inside, quick.	23	2	7
349	 Hurry up!	23	2	7
350	 - ( Dog barking ) -  Can't find anything, Ser.	23	2	7
351	 - They've lost the scent. - Try again.	23	2	7
352	 We've circled this farmhouse twice.	23	2	7
353	 There's no sign of them.	23	2	7
354	 We could start the search fresh in the morning, My Lord.	23	2	7
355	 I'm looking at spending the rest of life	23	2	7
356	 being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people.	23	2	7
357	" Ask yourself, ""Is there anything I wouldn't do"""	23	2	7
358	" to stop that from happening?"""	23	2	7
359	 The hounds will find the scent again.	23	2	7
360	 I'll beat them until they do.	23	2	7
361	 I'll whip every man here	23	2	7
362	 until I have both those boys in hand.	23	2	7
363	 And once I've got them, the pampered little shits...	23	2	7
364	 It's better to be cruel than weak.	23	2	7
365	 Prince Theon.	24	2	7
366	 - Where are they? - Who, m'lord?	24	2	7
367	 The Stark boys. Where are they?	24	2	7
368	 I don't know. I seen no one.	24	2	7
369	 Oh!	24	2	7
370	 Think harder.	24	2	7
371	 I swear, m'lord, I don't know.	24	2	7
372	 My Lord, over here.	24	2	7
373	 I think I've found what we're looking for.	24	2	7
374	 Send the old man home.	24	2	7
375	 Go back to Winterfell.	24	2	7
376	 Take him back.	24	2	7
377	 Theon, don't do this.	24	2	7
378	 ( Birds chirping )	24	2	7
379	 You came back.	25	2	7
380	 As soon as I heard.	25	2	7
381	 Do you know anything?	25	2	7
382	 - Irri is dead. - I know.	25	2	7
383	 - She was a good... - She's dead.	25	2	7
384	 She died alone.	25	2	7
385	 She died for me and I couldn't protect her.	25	2	7
386	 Doreah?	25	2	7
387	 We can't find her.	25	2	7
388	 She must be dead, too.	25	2	7
389	 I led my people out of the Red Waste	25	2	7
390	 and into the slaughterhouse.	25	2	7
391	 I should have been here.	25	2	7
392	 You went to find me a ship.	25	2	7
393	 My place is by your side.	25	2	7
394	 I shouldn't have left you alone with these people.	25	2	7
395	 These people?	25	2	7
396	 They are not to be trusted.	25	2	7
397	 And who is to be trusted?	26	2	7
398	 Who are my people?	26	2	7
399	 The Targaryens?	26	2	7
400	 I only knew one... My brother,	26	2	7
401	 and he would have let 1,000 men rape me	26	2	7
402	 if it had got him the crown.	26	2	7
403	 The Dothraki?	26	2	7
404	 Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo	26	2	7
405	 fell from his horse.	26	2	7
406	 Your people are in Westeros.	26	2	7
407	 The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.	26	2	7
408	 - They will soon enough. - And then what?	26	2	7
409	 They'll pray for my return?	26	2	7
410	 They'll wave dragon banners and shout my name?	26	2	7
411	 That's what my brother believed and he was a fool.	26	2	7
412	 You are not your brother.	26	2	7
413	 Trust me, Khaleesi.	26	2	7
414	 There it is...	26	2	7
415	" ""trust me."""	26	2	7
416	 And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah?	26	2	7
417	 Only you?	26	2	7
418	 I don't need trust any longer.	26	2	7
419	 I don't want it and I don't have room for it.	26	2	7
420	 You are too young to be so...	27	2	7
421	 And you are too familiar.	27	2	7
422	 Forgive me, Khaleesi.	27	2	7
423	 No one can survive in this world without help.	27	2	7
424	 No one.	27	2	7
425	 Let me help you, please.	27	2	7
426	 Tell me how.	27	2	7
427	 Find my dragons.	27	2	7
428	  How long till we get back to your crows?	27	2	7
429	 We're close.	27	2	7
430	 What, a day? A half-day?	27	2	7
431	 You don't know, do you?	27	2	7
432	 - Do you even know where they are? - We're close.	27	2	7
433	 What do you think they'll say when they hear about you and me?	28	2	7
434	 Nothing happened between you and me.	28	2	7
435	" ""I swear it, old master king crow, Ser,"""	28	2	7
436	 we were only close together for warmth.	28	2	7
437	 And then I felt it,	28	2	7
438	 right up against me backside like a club.	28	2	7
439	 I can show you the bruise on me tailbone.	28	2	7
440	 And before I knew what was where, his... his...	28	2	7
441	 Well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like.	28	2	7
442	 And I didn't want to want it, but, oh, I did!	28	2	7
443	 And he spread me legs and... ruined.	28	2	7
444	 The shame of it.	28	2	7
445	 Now I can never marry a perfumed lord.	28	2	7
446	" ""What will me poor savage father say?"""	28	2	7
447	 Turn back around.	28	2	7
448	" ""And I thought that we were done, but he said,"	28	2	7
449	" ( deep voice ) 'Turn back around.'"""	28	2	7
450	 ( normal voice ) I'll tell you what, Jon Snow,	28	2	7
451	 since it's going to be your word against mine,	28	2	7
452	 and since you can't talk about it without blushing,	28	2	7
453	 we may as well just.	28	2	7
454	 What, right here in the muck?	29	2	7
455	 I'll keep you warm enough.	29	2	7
456	 Are you that afraid of it?	29	2	7
457	 That's enough.	29	2	7
458	 Oh, it's nice	29	2	7
459	 and wet and warm.	29	2	7
460	 Enough	29	2	7
461	 it don't have teeth.	29	2	7
462	 All right!	29	2	7
463	 All right.	29	2	7
464	 Gods, you're dull.	29	2	7
465	 ( Grunting )	29	2	7
466	 ( Sword rings )	29	2	7
467	 ( Ygritte whistles )	30	2	7
468	 Should have took me while you had the chance.	30	2	7
469	 ( Sansa crying )	30	2	7
470	 ( Sansa crying ) No, no!	30	2	7
471	 - ( Screams ) - ( Laughs )	30	2	7
472	 ( Screams )	30	2	7
473	 No. Oh, no.	30	2	7
474	 ( Whimpering )	31	2	7
475	 It's all right. Give me that.	31	2	7
476	 If the queen sees I can have Joffrey's children now...	31	2	7
477	 Help me flip it over.	31	2	7
478	 - Where are you going? - To tell her Grace.	31	2	7
479	 You'll say nothing to anyone.	31	2	7
480	 Do you understand?	31	2	7
481	 Your mother might have prepared you.	32	2	7
482	 You flowered, my dear. No more.	32	2	7
483	 My mother told me, but I thought it would be different.	32	2	7
484	 In what way?	32	2	7
485	 I thought it would be less...	32	2	7
486	 Less messy.	32	2	7
487	 Wait until you bear the child.	32	2	7
488	 You're a woman now.	32	2	7
489	 Do you have any idea what that means?	32	2	7
490	 I'm fit to bear children for the king?	32	2	7
491	 A prospect that once delighted you...	32	2	7
492	 Bringing little princes and princesses into the world,	32	2	7
493	 the greatest honor for a queen.	32	2	7
494	 Joffrey has always been difficult.	32	2	7
495	 Even his birth, I labored a day and a half	33	2	7
496	 to bring him into this world.	33	2	7
497	 You cannot imagine the pain.	33	2	7
498	 I screamed so loudly, I was sure	33	2	7
499	 Robert would hear me in the Kingswood.	33	2	7
500	 His Grace was not with you?	33	2	7
501	 Robert was hunting.	33	2	7
502	 That was his custom.	33	2	7
503	 Whenever my time was near,	33	2	7
504	 my royal husband would flee to the trees	33	2	7
505	 with his huntsmen and his hounds.	33	2	7
506	 And when he returned, he would present me	33	2	7
507	 with some pelts or a stag's head,	33	2	7
508	 and I would present him with a baby.	33	2	7
509	 Not that I wanted him there, mind you.	33	2	7
510	 I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives,	33	2	7
511	 and I had my brother.	33	2	7
512	 When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room,	33	2	7
513	 he smiled and asked which one of them	33	2	7
514	 proposed to keep him out.	33	2	7
515	 Joffrey will show you no such devotion.	34	2	7
516	 You may never love the king,	34	2	7
517	 but you will love his children.	34	2	7
518	 I love his Grace with all my heart.	34	2	7
519	 That's so very touching to hear.	34	2	7
520	 Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you	34	2	7
521	 on this very special day.	34	2	7
522	 The more people you love, the weaker you are.	34	2	7
523	 You'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do.	34	2	7
524	 You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe.	34	2	7
525	 Love no one but your children.	34	2	7
526	 On that front, a mother has no choice.	34	2	7
527	 But... shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?	34	2	7
528	 You can try,	34	2	7
529	 little dove.	35	2	7
530	 ( Chatter )	35	2	7
531	 Who did you say your mother was again?	35	2	7
532	 Cinda Lannister.	35	2	7
533	 Is she the fat one?	35	2	7
534	 Well, perhaps she's gotten a little larger than she...	35	2	7
535	 No, no. There's only one fat Lannister.	35	2	7
536	 If she was your mother, you'd know it.	35	2	7
537	 I... I squired for you once, you know?	35	2	7
538	 When?	35	2	7
539	 The tournament the day of Willem Frey's wedding.	35	2	7
540	 I went to Willem Frey's wedding?	35	2	7
541	 You did.	35	2	7
542	 Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he...	35	2	7
543	 He threw up on his horse	35	2	7
544	 on the way to the tourney grounds.	35	2	7
545	 - What was his name? - Bryan.	36	2	7
546	 ( Laughs ) Poor lad.	36	2	7
547	 That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall.	36	2	7
548	 I remember you.	36	2	7
549	 You had never squired for anyone before.	36	2	7
550	 That's right. I ran up and volunteered.	36	2	7
551	" ""Let me, My Lord. Let me."""	36	2	7
552	 My father was furious,	36	2	7
553	 afraid I'd embarrass our family	36	2	7
554	 in front of the family.	36	2	7
555	 You didn't, though.	36	2	7
556	 - You really remember? - Mm.	36	2	7
557	 You knew when you were needed and when to go away.	36	2	7
558	 It's a rare talent.	36	2	7
559	 Most of my squires, they mean well,	36	2	7
560	 but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them.	36	2	7
561	 Well, when I think back to that day...	36	2	7
562	 ( hisses )	36	2	7
563	 You were saying?	37	2	7
564	 I...	37	2	7
565	 Never mind. It's embarrassing.	37	2	7
566	 More embarrassing than being chained to a post	37	2	7
567	 covered in your own shit?	37	2	7
568	 I remember everything about that day...	37	2	7
569	 Your helmet, your horse,	37	2	7
570	 the rake line in the dirt along the list,	37	2	7
571	 where the sun was in the sky	37	2	7
572	 when you knocked Balon Swann from his horse,	37	2	7
573	 and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me.	37	2	7
574	 I'll remember it all until I die.	37	2	7
575	 That was the best day of my life.	37	2	7
576	 And I remember being on the field after it was over.	37	2	7
577	 All the competitors were done.	37	2	7
578	 I was the last one out there.	37	2	7
579	 And I couldn't leave.	37	2	7
580	 I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family	37	2	7
581	 at a table so far on the edge of the feast	38	2	7
582	 you could barely even see the bride.	38	2	7
583	 And I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you	38	2	7
584	 when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea	38	2	7
585	 what I was talking about.	38	2	7
586	 I understand completely.	38	2	7
587	 How could you?	38	2	7
588	 S-sorry, I... I didn't mean to doubt you.	38	2	7
589	 - It's just that I... - I was 16 once.	38	2	7
590	 I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice.	38	2	7
591	 Which knight was it?	38	2	7
592	 Barristan Selmy.	38	2	7
593	 The fight against the Kingswood outlaws.	38	2	7
594	 Before your time.	38	2	7
595	 What was he like?	38	2	7
596	 ( Sighs )	38	2	7
597	 He was	38	2	7
598	 a painter,	38	2	7
599	 a painter who only used red.	38	2	7
600	 I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that,	38	2	7
601	 not back then.	39	2	7
602	 And to help him do that, to be a part of something	39	2	7
603	 that perfect...	39	2	7
604	 I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you.	39	2	7
605	 It's hard to put into words.	39	2	7
606	 It's like stepping into a dream	39	2	7
607	 you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember	39	2	7
608	 and finding out that the dream	39	2	7
609	 is more real than your life.	39	2	7
610	 Leaving that battlefield was	39	2	7
611	 like being dragged off to prison.	39	2	7
612	 - Did you squire for him again? - No.	39	2	7
613	 I didn't have your gift.	39	2	7
614	 He couldn't take a step without stepping on me.	39	2	7
615	 I was awful, a complete liability...	39	2	7
616	 until one of the outlaws	39	2	7
617	 decided to take on a 16-year-old squire.	39	2	7
618	 It's a good thing I am who I am.	40	2	7
619	 ( Chuckles ) I'd have been useless at anything else.	40	2	7
620	 I'm not well-suited for imprisonment.	40	2	7
621	 Shocking, I know.	40	2	7
622	 Some men are.	40	2	7
623	 Ned Stark... I imagine he made	40	2	7
624	 an excellent prisoner right up until the end.	40	2	7
625	 But me, though... My life has left me	40	2	7
626	 uniquely unfit for constraint.	40	2	7
627	 Have you thought about...?	40	2	7
628	 Of course.	40	2	7
629	 - Every day. - And?	40	2	7
630	 Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently.	40	2	7
631	 The Starks are very careful.	40	2	7
632	 But there is a way, I think.	40	2	7
633	 It wasn't possible until now.	41	2	7
634	 What is it?	41	2	7
635	 - It's actually quite simple. - Well, let me help you.	41	2	7
636	 You'll only have to do one thing.	41	2	7
637	 Tell me.	41	2	7
638	 You'll have to die.	41	2	7
639	 ( Crunching )	41	2	7
640	 ( Choking )	42	2	7
641	 ( Bone breaks )	42	2	7
642	 ( Bird screeching )	42	2	7
643	 Jorah the Andal.	42	2	7
644	 This man must sail past old Valyria.	42	2	7
645	 All who travel too close to the Doom must have protection.	42	2	7
646	 I didn't come here for lessons.	42	2	7
647	 No, you came for the dragons.	42	2	7
648	 You have them?	42	2	7
649	 Where are they?	42	2	7
650	 Draw your sword.	42	2	7
651	 See what your steel is worth.	42	2	7
652	 You want to please the Mother of Dragons.	42	2	7
653	 You love her.	43	2	7
654	 Where are the dragons?	43	2	7
655	 Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?	43	2	7
656	 Will you betray her again?	43	2	7
657	 Never.	43	2	7
658	 The thief you seek	43	2	7
659	 is with her now.	43	2	7
660	 Spice  I did not leave the comfort of my home	43	2	7
661	 to come to yours and be called a thief.	43	2	7
662	 No one is calling you a thief.	43	2	7
663	 Who is she to accuse us?	43	2	7
664	 Please, they're my children.	43	2	7
665	 - I'm begging you. - Begging us?	43	2	7
666	 It wasn't very long ago you were threatening us.	43	2	7
667	 Without me, the dragons will die.	44	2	7
668	 It will be for the best.	44	2	7
669	 Your dragons will bring the world	44	2	7
670	 nothing but death and misery, my dear.	44	2	7
671	 If I knew where they were, I would not tell you.	44	2	7
672	 Pyat  You are cruel, my friend.	44	2	7
673	 The mother of dragons is in the right.	44	2	7
674	 She must be reunited with her babies.	44	2	7
675	 - I will help you, Khaleesi. - How?	44	2	7
676	 I will take you to the House of the Undying	44	2	7
677	 where I have put them.	44	2	7
678	 You have my dragons?	44	2	7
679	 When I learned you were coming to our city,	44	2	7
680	 I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth.	44	2	7
681	 ( Laughter )	44	2	7
682	 He procured them for me.	44	2	7
683	 - But there is no King of Qarth. -  There is now.	44	2	7
684	 That was the other half of the arrangement.	44	2	7
685	 You would keep your gates and your minds closed	44	2	7
686	 to everything outside your walls,	44	2	7
687	 but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was	45	2	7
688	 if it refuses to change.	45	2	7
689	 I will open Qarth to the world	45	2	7
690	 as I have forced it to open itself to me.	45	2	7
691	 Your ambition is an inspiration.	45	2	7
692	 But like all upstarts, you overreach.	45	2	7
693	 Three dragons the size of cats	45	2	7
694	 and an alliance with a charlatan	45	2	7
695	 do not make you a king.	45	2	7
696	 An upstart and a charlatan?	45	2	7
697	 Empires have been built by less.	45	2	7
698	 Those on the margins often come to control the center,	45	2	7
699	 and those in the center make room for them,	45	2	7
700	 willingly or otherwise.	45	2	7
701	 The Mother of Dragons will be with her babies.	45	2	7
702	 She will give them her love	45	2	7
703	 and they will thrive by her side...	45	2	7
704	 forever.	45	2	7
705	 A mother should be with her children.	46	2	7
706	 Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn?	46	2	7
707	 Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying.	46	2	7
708	 Come see them.	46	2	7
709	 - Lady Stark! - No farther.	46	2	7
710	 Keep your hands off me, woman.	46	2	7
711	 Don't enter without an invitation, man.	46	2	7
712	 Forgive me. Lady Stark.	46	2	7
713	 -  What is it? - They caught the Kingslayer.	46	2	7
714	 ( Men shouting )	47	2	7
715	 - Kill the fucking Kingslayer! - Hang him!	47	2	7
716	 ( Men shouting )	47	2	7
717	 You'll die today.	47	2	7
718	 Justice for the Karstark.	47	2	7
719	 Gut him!	47	2	7
720	 Get back! I want his head!	47	2	7
721	 Any man who stands between a father	47	2	7
722	 and his vengeance asks for death.	47	2	7
723	 Lord Karstark,	47	2	7
724	 this man is our prisoner.	47	2	7
725	 This monster killed my son.	48	2	7
726	 And crippled mine.	48	2	7
727	 He will answer for his crimes,	48	2	7
728	 I promise you, but not here.	48	2	7
729	 I will have his head. And if you try and stop me...	48	2	7
730	 You will strike me down?	48	2	7
731	 Have you forgotten me, Ser?	48	2	7
732	 I am the widow of your liege Lord Eddark Stark.	48	2	7
733	 I am the mother of your king!	48	2	7
734	 - And where is our king now? - You know very well.	48	2	7
735	 He has gone to the Crag to accept the surrender.	48	2	7
736	 Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate.	48	2	7
737	 He brought that foreign bitch with him.	48	2	7
738	 How dare you?	48	2	7
739	 Threatening My Lady is an act of treason.	48	2	7
740	 Treason?	48	2	7
741	 How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?	48	2	7
742	 I understand your grief, My Lord...	48	2	7
743	 Better than most I understand it...	48	2	7
744	 But in the name of my son, the King in the North,	48	2	7
745	 stand down.	48	2	7
746	 When your son returns,	48	2	7
747	 I will demand this murderer's head.	48	2	7
748	 Wise men do not make demands of kings.	48	2	7
749	 Fathers who love their sons do.	49	2	7
750	 I will have his head.	49	2	7
751	 Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark.	49	2	7
752	 I would have come to your defense, but...	49	2	7
753	 Take him to the stockades.	49	2	7
754	 Bind him with every chain you can find!	49	2	7
755	 You've become a real she-wolf in your later years.	49	2	7
756	 There's not much fish left in you.	49	2	7
757	 And gag him!	49	2	7
758	 Since when do you light your own candles?	49	2	7
759	 Since I decided that I can't stand to look	49	2	7
760	 at any of my handmaidens for another instant.	49	2	7
761	 How many times can you read one raven scroll?	49	2	7
762	 Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north	49	2	7
763	 past Tarth... 200 ships.	49	2	7
764	 - More than we have. - Yes, that's more than we have.	49	2	7
765	 He'll be at our gates within five days,	49	2	7
766	 four if he has the wind.	49	2	7
767	 We have strong, high walls.	49	2	7
768	 We'll rain fire down on them from above.	50	2	7
769	" ""Rain fire on them from above."""	50	2	7
770	 You're quoting father, aren't you?	50	2	7
771	 Why not?	50	2	7
772	 He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?	50	2	7
773	 We call it tactics, not strategy.	50	2	7
774	 But, yes, he does have a good mind for it.	50	2	7
775	 The best mind, some would say.	50	2	7
776	 Sadly, he's not here.	50	2	7
777	 It's just you, me, and Joffrey,	50	2	7
778	 the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms	50	2	7
779	 and protector of the realm.	50	2	7
780	 I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.	50	2	7
781	 He needs to start acting like a king.	50	2	7
782	 This war you started is coming to our doorstep.	50	2	7
783	 And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead...	50	2	7
784	 I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.	50	2	7
785	 I thought the girls might help him.	50	2	7
786	 - Did you? - I was wrong.	50	2	7
787	 If we can't control him...	50	2	7
788	 Do you think I haven't tried?	50	2	7
789	 He doesn't listen to me.	51	2	7
790	 It's hard to put a leash on a dog	51	2	7
791	 once you've put a crown on its head.	51	2	7
792	 I always hoped he'd be like Jaime.	51	2	7
793	 He looks like him...	51	2	7
794	 in a certain light.	51	2	7
795	 The boy is more Robert than Jaime.	51	2	7
796	 Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty.	51	2	7
797	 Sometimes I wonder...	51	2	7
798	 What?	51	2	7
799	 If this is the price	51	2	7
800	 for what we've done, for our sins.	51	2	7
801	 Sins?	51	2	7
802	 The Targaryens...	51	2	7
803	 Wed brother and sister for hundreds of years,	51	2	7
804	 I know.	52	2	7
805	 That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt.	52	2	7
806	 It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me.	52	2	7
807	 Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they?	52	2	7
808	 What's the saying?	52	2	7
809	 Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin.	52	2	7
810	 You've beaten the odds.	52	2	7
811	 Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children,	52	2	7
812	 both of them.	52	2	7
813	 ( Crying )	52	2	7
814	 - Why wait? - We're sworn to the king.	53	2	7
815	 - There's not a king. - That's treason.	53	2	7
816	 So is saving Lannisters, yeah?	53	2	7
817	 - Back off, you. - No, I won't.	53	2	7
818	 Your son returns at dawn, My Lady?	53	2	7
819	 So they say.	53	2	7
820	  The Kingslayer won't last the night.	53	2	7
821	 The more they drink, the angrier they'll get.	53	2	7
822	 And when the Karstarks draw their swords...	53	2	7
823	 who wants to die defending a Lannister?	53	2	7
824	 Come.	53	2	7
825	 I need to be alone with him.	53	2	7
826	 - My Lady, our orders... - Your orders, which I just gave you,	53	2	7
827	 are to leave me alone with him.	53	2	7
828	 Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark?	54	2	7
829	 I believe it's my last night in this world.	54	2	7
830	 Is that a woman?	54	2	7
831	 Do you hear them out there?	54	2	7
832	 They want your head.	54	2	7
833	 Well, old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.	54	2	7
834	 You strangled his son with your chains.	54	2	7
835	 Oh, oh.	54	2	7
836	 Was he the one on guard duty?	54	2	7
837	 ( Sighs )	54	2	7
838	 He was in my way.	54	2	7
839	 Any Knight would have done the same.	54	2	7
840	 You are no Knight.	54	2	7
841	 You have forsaken every vow you ever took.	54	2	7
842	 So many vows.	54	2	7
843	 They make you swear and swear.	54	2	7
844	 Defend the king, obey the king,	54	2	7
845	 obey your father,	54	2	7
846	 protect the innocent, defend the weak.	54	2	7
847	 But what if your father despises the king?	54	2	7
848	 What if the king massacres the innocent?	55	2	7
849	 It's too much.	55	2	7
850	 No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another.	55	2	7
851	 Where did you find this beast?	55	2	7
852	 She is a truer Knight than you will ever be,	55	2	7
853	 Kingslayer.	55	2	7
854	 Kingslayer.	55	2	7
855	 What a king he was.	55	2	7
856	 Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the second of his name,	55	2	7
857	 Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the realm,	55	2	7
858	 and to the sword I shoved in his back.	55	2	7
859	 You are a man without honor.	55	2	7
860	 Do you know	55	2	7
861	 I've never been with any woman but Cersei?	55	2	7
862	 So in my own way,	55	2	7
863	 I have more honor than poor old dead Ned.	55	2	7
864	 What was the name of that bastard so in he fathered?	55	2	7
865	 - Brienne. - No, that wasn't it.	56	2	7
866	 Snow, a bastard from the North.	56	2	7
867	 Now, when... When good old Ned	56	2	7
868	 came home with some whore's baby,	56	2	7
869	 did you pretend to love it?	56	2	7
870	 No. You're not very good at pretending.	56	2	7
871	 You're an honest woman.	56	2	7
872	 You hated that boy, didn't you?	56	2	7
873	 How could you not hate him?	56	2	7
874	 The walking, talking reminder	56	2	7
875	 that the honorable Lord Eddark Stark	56	2	7
876	 fucked another woman.	56	2	7
877	 Your sword.	56	2	7
878	 I told you what would happen.	56	2	7
879	 All of you...	56	2	7
880	 I told you what would happen if you served me loyally...	57	2	7
881	 and what would happen if you did not.	57	2	7
882	 What are you doing? What have you done?	57	2	7
883	 If there's any who still question whether your new lord	57	2	7
884	 means what he says...	57	2	7
885	 Here is the answer to your question.	57	2	7

25	 We've come to a dangerous place. We must protect ourselves.	1	1	4
26	 Ah!	1	1	4
27	 We allow the Northerners too much power.	1	1	4
28	 A good King knows when to save his strength	1	1	4
29	 and when to destroy his enemies.	1	1	4
30	 So you agree... The Starks are enemies?	1	1	4
31	 Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.	1	1	4
32	 - Do you know whose dagger this is? -  I do.	1	1	4
33	 Tyrion Lannister's...	1	1	4
34	 The imp.	1	1	4

37	 The little lord's been dreaming again.	4	1	4
38	 - We have visitors. - I don't want to see anyone.	4	1	4
39	 Really? If I was cooped up all day	4	1	4
40	 with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad.	4	1	4
41	 Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting.	4	1	4
42	 - I don't want to go. - Neither do I.	4	1	4
43	 But Robb's Lord of Winterfell,	4	1	4
44	 which means I do what he says, and you do what I say.	4	1	4
45	 Hodor!	5	1	4
46	 - Hodor? - Help Bran down the hall.	5	1	4
47	 Hodor.	5	1	4
48	 I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.	5	1	4
49	 Any man of The Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.	5	1	4
50	 Any man of The Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?	5	1	4
51	 I'm not your boy, Lannister.	5	1	4
52	 I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away.	5	1	4
53	 Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.	5	1	4
54	 So it's true.	5	1	4
55	 Hello, Bran.	5	1	4
56	 Do you remember anything about what happened?	5	1	4
57	 He has no memory of that day.	5	1	4
58	 - Curious. - Why are you here	5	1	4
59	 would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel?	5	1	4
60	 - My neck is beginning to hurt. - Kneel, Hodor.	6	1	4
61	 - Do you like to ride, Bran? - Yes.	6	1	4
62	 Well, I mean I did like to.	6	1	4
63	 - The boy has lost the use of his legs. - What of it?	6	1	4
64	 With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride.	6	1	4
65	 - I'm not a cripple. - Then I'm not a dwarf.	6	1	4
66	 My father will rejoice to hear it.	6	1	4
67	 I have a gift for you.	6	1	4
68	 Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest.	6	1	4
69	 You must shape the horse to the rider.	6	1	4
70	 Start with a yearling and teach it to respond	6	1	4
71	 to the reins and to the boy's voice.	6	1	4
72	 Will I really be able to ride?	6	1	4
73	 You will.	6	1	4
74	 On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.	6	1	4
75	 Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?	6	1	4
76	 I have a tender spot in my heart	6	1	4
77	 for cripples, bastards and broken things.	6	1	4
78	 You've done my brother a kindness.	6	1	4
79	 The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.	6	1	4
80	 Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark.	6	1	4
81	 There's a brothel outside your walls.	7	1	4
82	 There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier.	7	1	4
83	 Couldn't resist some Northern ass?	7	1	4
84	 If you like redheads, ask for Ros.	7	1	4
85	 Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you.	7	1	4
86	 Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters.	7	1	4
87	 - He's not my master. - No, of course not.	7	1	4
88	 What happened here?	7	1	4
89	 Where is Lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?	7	1	4
90	 - She wasn't feeling well. - She's not in Winterfell, is she?	7	1	4
91	 - Where did she go? - My Lady's whereabouts--	7	1	4
92	 My Lady?	7	1	4
93	 Your loyalty to your captors is touching.	7	1	4
94	 Tell me, how do you think balon Greyjoy would feel	7	1	4
95	 if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey?	7	1	4
96	 I still remember seeing my father's fleet	7	1	4
97	 burn in Lannisport.	7	1	4
98	 I believe your uncles were responsible?	7	1	4
99	 Must have been a pretty sight.	7	1	4
100	 Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive.	7	1	4
101	 Yes, a great victory for your people.	8	1	4
102	 - Shame how it all turned out. - We were outnumbered 10 to one--	8	1	4
103	 a stupid rebellion then.	8	1	4
104	 I suppose your father realized that	8	1	4
105	 when your brothers died in battle.	8	1	4
106	 Now here you are, your enemy's squire.	8	1	4
107	 - Careful, imp. - I've offended you.	8	1	4
108	 Forgive me, it's been a rough morning.	8	1	4
109	 Anyway, don't despair.	8	1	4
110	 I'm a constant disappointment to my own father	8	1	4
111	 and I've learned to live with it.	8	1	4
112	 Your next tumble with Ros is on me.	8	1	4
113	 I'll try not to wear her out.	8	1	4
114	 Shoulder, legs.	8	1	4
115	 Leg, shoulder, leg.	8	1	4
116	 Left foot forward. Good.	8	1	4
117	 Now pivot as you deliver the stroke.	9	1	4
118	 Put all your weight behind it.	9	1	4
119	 What in seven hells is that?	9	1	4
120	 They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.	9	1	4
121	 Tell them your name.	9	1	4
122	 Samwell Tarly,	9	1	4
123	 of Horn Hill-- I mean, I was of Horn Hill.	9	1	4
124	 - I've come to take the black. - Come to take the black pudding.	9	1	4
125	 Well, you couldn't be any worse than you look.	9	1	4
126	 Rast...	9	1	4
127	 See what he can do.	9	1	4
128	 I yield.	9	1	4
129	 - Please, no more. - On your feet.	9	1	4
130	 Pick up your sword.	9	1	4
131	 Hit him till he finds his feet.	9	1	4
132	 It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down South.	10	1	4
133	 - Now they send us squealing bloody pigs. - Jon!	10	1	4
134	 Again, harder.	10	1	4
135	 I yield!	10	1	4
136	 Enough!	10	1	4
137	 He yielded.	10	1	4
138	 Looks like the bastard's in love.	10	1	4
139	 All right then, Lord Snow,	10	1	4
140	 you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise.	10	1	4
141	 You two. Three of you ought to be sufficient	10	1	4
142	 to make lady piggy squeal.	10	1	4
143	 All you've got to do is get past the bastard.	10	1	4
144	 - Are you sure you want to do this? - No.	10	1	4
145	 Yield yield yield! I yield.	11	1	4
146	 We're done for today.	11	1	4
147	 Go clean the armory.	11	1	4
148	 That's all you're good for.	11	1	4
149	 - Well fought! - Piss off.	11	1	4
150	 Did he hurt you?	11	1	4
151	 I've had worse.	11	1	4
152	 You can call me Sam... If you want.	11	1	4
153	 - My mother calls me Sam-- - it's not going to get any easier, you know?	11	1	4
154	 You're going to have to defend yourself.	11	1	4
155	 Why didn't you get up and fight?	11	1	4
156	 I wanted to.	11	1	4
157	 - I just couldn't. - Why not?	11	1	4
158	 I'm a coward.	11	1	4
159	 - My father always says so. - The Wall's no place for cowards.	11	1	4
160	 You're right. I'm sorry.	11	1	4
161	 I just... wanted to thank you.	11	1	4
162	 A bloody coward.	12	1	4
163	 People saw us talking to him.	12	1	4
164	 Now they'll think we're cowards too.	12	1	4
165	 You're too stupid to be a coward.	12	1	4
166	 - You're too stupid to be a-- - Quick now,	12	1	4
167	 before summer's over.	12	1	4
168	 C'mere!	12	1	4
169	 Hyah hyah!	12	1	4
170	 Vaes Dothrak-- the city of the horselords.	13	1	4
171	 A pile of mud.	13	1	4
172	 Mud and shit and twigs--	13	1	4
173	 - best these savages can do. - These are my people now.	13	1	4
174	 You shouldn't call them savages.	13	1	4
175	 I'll call them what I like, because they're my people.	13	1	4
176	 This is my army.	13	1	4
177	 Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army.	13	1	4
178	 If my brother was given an army of Dothraki,	13	1	4
179	 could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?	13	1	4
180	 The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea.	13	1	4
181	 They fear any water their horses can't drink.	14	1	4
182	 But if they did?	14	1	4
183	 King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle,	14	1	4
184	 but the men advising him are different.	14	1	4
185	 - And you know these men? - I fought beside them once,	14	1	4
186	 long ago.	14	1	4
187	 Now Ned Stark wants my head.	14	1	4
188	 He drove me from my land.	14	1	4
189	 You sold slaves.	14	1	4
190	 Aye.	14	1	4
191	 - Why? - I had no money	14	1	4
192	 and an expensive wife.	14	1	4
193	 And where is she now?	14	1	4
194	 In another place,	14	1	4
195	 with another man.	14	1	4
196	 - Your Grace? - Yes, my dear?	14	1	4
197	 They call you the Last Dragon...	14	1	4
198	 They do.	14	1	4
199	 You have dragon's blood	15	1	4
200	 in your veins?	15	1	4
201	 It's entirely possible.	15	1	4
202	 What happened to the dragons?	15	1	4
203	 I was told that brave men killed them all.	15	1	4
204	 The brave men didn't kill dragons.	15	1	4
205	 The brave men rode them.	15	1	4
206	 Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization	15	1	4
207	 this world has ever seen.	15	1	4
208	 The breath of the greatest dragon	15	1	4
209	 forged the Iron Throne,	15	1	4
210	 which the usurper is keeping warm for me.	15	1	4
211	 The swords of the vanquished,	15	1	4
212	 a thousand of them...	15	1	4
213	 Melted together like so many candles.	15	1	4
214	 I have always wanted to see a dragon.	15	1	4
215	 There is nothing in the world that I would rather see.	16	1	4
216	 Really. Why dragons?	16	1	4
217	 They can fly.	16	1	4
218	 And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings	16	1	4
219	 and they're somewhere else...	16	1	4
220	 Far away.	16	1	4
221	 And they can kill.	16	1	4
222	 Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them	16	1	4
223	 gets burned away to nothing...	16	1	4
224	 ...Like so many candles.	16	1	4
225	 Ow.	16	1	4
226	 Yes. Seeing a dragon	16	1	4
227	 would make me very happy.	16	1	4
228	 Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house,	16	1	4
229	 I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy.	16	1	4
230	 I was not locked in. I have seen things.	16	1	4
231	 - What have you seen? - I've seen...	16	1	4
232	 A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass.	16	1	4
233	 - Ooh. - I've seen a man who could	17	1	4
234	 change his face the way that other men change their clothes.	17	1	4
235	 And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold	17	1	4
236	 and whose ship had sails of colored silk.	17	1	4
237	 So...	17	1	4
238	 Have you seen one?	17	1	4
239	 - A pirate ship? - A dragon.	17	1	4
240	 No.	17	1	4
241	 No, the last one died many years before I was born.	17	1	4
242	 I'll tell you what I have seen:	17	1	4
243	 Their skulls.	17	1	4
244	 They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep.	17	1	4
245	 When I was very young, just three or four,	17	1	4
246	 my father used to walk me down the rows	17	1	4
247	 and I'd recite their names for him.	17	1	4
248	 When I got them all right, he'd give me a sweet.	17	1	4
249	 The ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch	17	1	4
250	 and they were all stunted and wrong.	17	1	4
251	 Skulls no bigger than dog skulls.	18	1	4
252	 But as you got closer to the Iron Throne...	18	1	4
253	 They got bigger	18	1	4
254	 and bigger and bigger.	18	1	4
255	 There was Ghiscar	18	1	4
256	 and Valryon,	18	1	4
257	 Vermithrax,	18	1	4
258	 Essovius--	18	1	4
259	 Archonei,	18	1	4
260	 Meraxes,	18	1	4
261	 Vhagar...	18	1	4
262	 And Balerion the dread...	18	1	4
263	 ...Whose fire forged	18	1	4
264	 the Seven Kingdoms	18	1	4
265	 into one.	18	1	4
266	 What happened to the skulls?	18	1	4
267	 I don't know.	19	1	4
268	 The usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect.	19	1	4
269	 Scattered to the wind.	19	1	4
270	 That's very sad.	19	1	4
271	 Yes, it is.	19	1	4
272	 What did I buy you for?	19	1	4
273	 - To make me sad? - No, your Grace.	19	1	4
274	 To, uh, teach your sister.	19	1	4
275	 To teach my sister how to be a better lover?	19	1	4
276	 You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy?	19	1	4
277	 Oh, you pretty little idiot.	19	1	4
278	 Go on then. Get on with it.	19	1	4
279	 Someday your husband will sit there	20	1	4
280	 and you will sit by his side.	20	1	4
281	 And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court.	20	1	4
282	 All the Lords of Westeros	20	1	4
283	 will gather here to see the little prince--	20	1	4
284	 what if I have a girl?	20	1	4
285	 Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them.	20	1	4
286	 What if I only have girls?	20	1	4
287	 I wouldn't worry about that.	20	1	4
288	 Jeyne Poole's mother had five children-- all of them girls.	20	1	4
289	 Yes, but it's highly unlikely.	20	1	4
290	 But what if?	20	1	4
291	 Well, if you only had girls,	20	1	4
292	 I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother.	20	1	4
293	 And everyone would hate me.	20	1	4
294	 Nobody could ever hate you.	20	1	4
295	 - Joffrey does. - Nonsense.	20	1	4
296	 Why would you say such a thing?	20	1	4
297	 That business with the wolves? Sansa,	20	1	4
298	 I've told you a hundred times:	21	1	4
299	 - A direwolf is not-- - please shut up about it.	21	1	4
300	 Do you remember your lessons?	21	1	4
301	 Who built the Iron Throne?	21	1	4
302	 Aegon the Conqueror.	21	1	4
303	 And who built the Red Keep?	21	1	4
304	 Maegor the Cruel.	21	1	4
305	 And how many years did it take to build--	21	1	4
306	 my grandfather and Uncle were murdered here, weren't they?	21	1	4
307	 They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes.	21	1	4
308	 - The Mad King. - Commonly known as the Mad King.	21	1	4
309	 Why were they killed?	21	1	4
310	 You should be speak to your father about these matters.	21	1	4
311	 I don't want to speak to my father-- ever.	21	1	4
312	 Sansa, you will find it in your heart	21	1	4
313	 to forgive your father.	21	1	4
314	 No, I won't.	21	1	4
315	 It's The Hand's tournament that's causing	21	1	4
316	 - all this trouble, My Lords. - The King's tournament.	21	1	4
317	 I assure you The Hand wants no part of it.	21	1	4
318	 Call it what you will, Lord Stark, Ser,	22	1	4
319	 the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day.	22	1	4
320	 Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire,	22	1	4
321	 three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters.	22	1	4
322	 - Dreadful. - If you can't keep the King's peace,	22	1	4
323	 perhaps the city watch should be commanded by someone who can.	22	1	4
324	 - I need more men. -  You'll get 50.	22	1	4
325	 - Lord Baelish will see it paid for. - I will?	22	1	4
326	 You found money for a champion's purse,	22	1	4
327	 you can find money to keep the peace.	22	1	4
328	 I'll also give you 20 of my household guard	22	1	4
329	 till the crowds have left.	22	1	4
330	 Thank you, My Lord Hand, Ser.	22	1	4
331	 They will be put to good use.	22	1	4
332	 The sooner this is over, the better.	22	1	4
333	 The realm prospers from such events, My Lord.	22	1	4
334	 They give the great a chance at glory,	22	1	4
335	 and the lowly a respite from their woes.	22	1	4
336	 And every inn in the city is full	22	1	4
337	 and the whores are walking bow-legged.	22	1	4
338	 I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket.	22	1	4
339	 - Hmmm. - Now...	22	1	4
340	 If there's nothing else, My Lords?	23	1	4
341	 Oh, this heat.	23	1	4
342	 On days like this, I envy you Northerners	23	1	4
343	 your summer snows.	23	1	4
344	 Until tomorrow, My Lord--	23	1	4
345	 I've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.	23	1	4
346	 Lord Arryn?	23	1	4
347	 Oh, his death was	23	1	4
348	 a great sadness to all of us.	23	1	4
349	 I took personal charge of his care,	23	1	4
350	 but I could not save him.	23	1	4
351	 His sickness struck him	23	1	4
352	 very hard and very fast.	23	1	4
353	 I saw him in my chambers	23	1	4
354	 just the night before he passed.	23	1	4
355	 Lord Jon often came to me for counsel.	23	1	4
356	 Why?	23	1	4
357	 I have been Grand Maester for many years.	23	1	4
358	 Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since--	24	1	4
359	 What did Jon want the night before he died?	24	1	4
360	 Oh, he came inquiring after a book.	24	1	4
361	 A book?	24	1	4
362	 What book?	24	1	4
363	 Oh, I fear	24	1	4
364	 it would be of little interest to you, My Lord.	24	1	4
365	 A ponderous Tome.	24	1	4
366	 No, I'd like to read it.	24	1	4
367	" ""The Lineages and Histories"	24	1	4
368	 of the Great H of the Seven Kingdoms,	24	1	4
369	 with descriptions of many high lords	24	1	4
370	 and noble ladies	24	1	4
371	" and their children."""	24	1	4
372	" ""Harkon Umber, first of his name,"	25	1	4
373	 born to Lord Hother Umber and Lady Amaryllis Umber	25	1	4
374	 in the 183rd year after Aegon's landing,	25	1	4
375	 at the last hearth. Blue of eye, brown of hair	25	1	4
376	 and fair complected, died in his 14th year	25	1	4
377	" of a wound sustained in a bear hunt."""	25	1	4
378	 As I said, My Lord, a ponderous read.	25	1	4
379	 Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?	25	1	4
380	 He did not, My Lord. And I did not presume to ask.	25	1	4
381	 - Jon's death... - Such a tragedy.	25	1	4
382	 ...Did he say anything to you during his final hours?	25	1	4
383	 Nothing of import, My Lord.	25	1	4
384	 Oh-- there was one phrase	25	1	4
385	 he kept repeating:	25	1	4
386	" ""The seed is strong,"" I think it was."	25	1	4
387	" - ""The seed is strong""? - Mm."	25	1	4
388	 - What does that mean? - Oh,	25	1	4
389	 the dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark.	25	1	4
390	 For all the weight they're given,	25	1	4
391	 last words are usually	25	1	4
392	 as significant as first words.	26	1	4
393	 And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?	26	1	4
394	 What else could it be?	26	1	4
395	 Poison.	26	1	4
396	 A disturbing thought.	26	1	4
397	 No no no, I don't think it likely.	26	1	4
398	 The Hand was loved by all.	26	1	4
399	 What sort of man would dare--	26	1	4
400	 I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.	26	1	4
401	 Yes, women,	26	1	4
402	 cravens...	26	1	4
403	 And eunuchs.	26	1	4
404	 Did you know that Lord Varys is a eunuch?	26	1	4
405	 Everybody knows that.	26	1	4
406	 Yes yes, of course.	26	1	4
407	 How that sort of person found himself	26	1	4
408	 on the King's Council, I will never know.	26	1	4
409	 I've taken enough of your time.	26	1	4
410	 No trouble at all, My Lord. It's a great honor--	26	1	4
411	 thank you.	26	1	4
412	 I'll find my own way out.	26	1	4
413	 Syrio says a water dancer	27	1	4
414	 can stand on one toe for hours.	27	1	4
415	 It's a hard fall down these steps.	27	1	4
416	 Syrio says every hurt is a lesson	27	1	4
417	 and every lesson makes you better.	27	1	4
418	 - Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats. - Cats?	27	1	4
419	 Syrio says.	27	1	4
420	 He says every swordsman should study cats.	27	1	4
421	 They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers.	27	1	4
422	 You have to be quick to catch them.	27	1	4
423	 He's right about that.	27	1	4
424	 Now that Bran's awake	27	1	4
425	 will he come live with us?	27	1	4
426	 Well, he needs to get his strength back first.	27	1	4
427	 He wants to be a knight of the Kingsguard.	27	1	4
428	 - He can't be one now, can he? - No.	28	1	4
429	 But someday	28	1	4
430	 he could be Lord of a Holdfast	28	1	4
431	 or sit on the King's Council.	28	1	4
432	 Or he might raise castles	28	1	4
433	 like Brandon the builder.	28	1	4
434	 Can I be Lord of a Holdfast?	28	1	4
435	 You will marry a high lord	28	1	4
436	 and rule his castle.	28	1	4
437	 And your sons shall be knights	28	1	4
438	 and princes and lords.	28	1	4
439	 Hmm? No.	28	1	4
440	 That's not me.	28	1	4
441	 Hello.	29	1	4
442	 Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new Watch partner.	29	1	4
443	 I should warn you,	29	1	4
444	 I don't see all that well.	29	1	4
445	 Come stand by the fire.	29	1	4
446	 - It's warmer. - No, that's all right. I'm fine.	29	1	4
447	 You're not. You're freezing.	29	1	4
448	 I don't like high places.	29	1	4
449	 You can't fight.	29	1	4
450	 You can't see.	29	1	4
451	 You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably.	29	1	4
452	 What are you doing here, Sam?	30	1	4
453	 On the morning of my 18th Nameday, my father came to me.	30	1	4
454	" ""You're almost a man now,"" he said..."	30	1	4
455	" ""But you're not worthy of my land and title."	30	1	4
456	 Tomorrow, you're going to take the black,	30	1	4
457	 forsake all claim to your inheritance and start North.	30	1	4
458	" If you do not,"" he said..."	30	1	4
459	" ""Then we'll have a hunt"	30	1	4
460	 and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble	30	1	4
461	 and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die.	30	1	4
462	 Or so I'll tell your mother.	30	1	4
463	" Nothing would please me more."""	30	1	4
464	 Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?	30	1	4
465	 Yes, he is.	30	1	4
466	 I'm not going to get any better, you know?	31	1	4
467	 Well...	31	1	4
468	 You can't get any worse.	31	1	4
469	 I hear you're reading a boring book.	31	1	4
470	 Hmph.	31	1	4
471	 Pycelle talks too much.	31	1	4
472	 Oh, he never stops.	31	1	4
473	 Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale?	31	1	4
474	 Not surprising. Until recently,	31	1	4
475	 he was only a squire-- Jon Arryn's squire.	31	1	4
476	 He was knighted almost immediately	31	1	4
477	 after his master's untimely death.	31	1	4
478	 Knighted for what?	31	1	4
479	 Why are you telling me this?	31	1	4
480	 I promised cat that I'd help you.	31	1	4
481	 Where is Ser Hugh?	31	1	4
482	 - I'll speak to him. - A singularly bad idea.	31	1	4
483	 Do you see that boy there?	31	1	4
484	 One of Varys's little birds.	32	1	4
485	 The spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings.	32	1	4
486	 Now look there.	32	1	4
487	 That one belongs to the Queen.	32	1	4
488	 And do you see that septa pretending to read her book?	32	1	4
489	 Varys or the Queen?	32	1	4
490	 No, she's one of mine.	32	1	4
491	 Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?	32	1	4
492	 - Yes. - The wiser answer was no, My Lord.	32	1	4
493	 Get a message to this paragon of yours--	32	1	4
494	 discreetly-- send him to question Ser Hugh.	32	1	4
495	 After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city.	32	1	4
496	 He lives in a large house at the top of the Street of Steel.	32	1	4
497	 - Why? - I have my observers, as I said,	32	1	4
498	 and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn	32	1	4
499	 visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death.	32	1	4
500	 Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you.	33	1	4
501	 Distrusting me was the wisest thing	33	1	4
502	 you've done since you climbed off your horse.	33	1	4
503	 ...Two, three,	33	1	4
504	 24, five,	33	1	4
505	 six, 27,	33	1	4
506	 - 28, 29-- - Ser Hugh?	33	1	4
507	 30, 31, 32	33	1	4
508	 - Ser Hugh! - As you can see, I'm busy.	33	1	4
509	 I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark,	33	1	4
510	 the Hand of the King.	33	1	4
511	 I'm the Captain of his guard.	33	1	4
512	 I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name, Ser...	33	1	4
513	" No ""Ser."" I'm not a knight."	33	1	4
514	 I see. Well, it just so happens that I am.	33	1	4
515	 He said he'd be glad to talk to the hand himself.	33	1	4
516	 He's a knight, you see.	33	1	4
517	 Ah, a knight.	33	1	4
518	 They strut around like roosters down here.	33	1	4
519	 Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.	34	1	4
520	 You shouldn't be out here, My Lord.	34	1	4
521	 - There's no telling who has eyes where. - Let them look.	34	1	4
522	 The former Hand did call on me, My Lord, several times.	34	1	4
523	 I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage.	34	1	4
524	 What did Lord Arryn want?	34	1	4
525	 He always came to see the boy.	34	1	4
526	 I'd like to see him as well.	34	1	4
527	 As you Gendry! My lord.	34	1	4
528	 Here he is.	34	1	4
529	 Strong for his age. He works hard.	34	1	4
530	 Show the hand the helmet you made, lad.	34	1	4
531	 - This is fine work. - It's not for sale.	34	1	4
532	 Boy, this is the King's Hand!	35	1	4
533	 - If his lordship wants the helm-- - I made it for me.	35	1	4
534	 - Forgive him, My Lord. - There's nothing to forgive.	35	1	4
535	 When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?	35	1	4
536	 He just asked me questions is all, My Lord.	35	1	4
537	 What kind of questions?	35	1	4
538	 About my work at first,	35	1	4
539	 if I was being treated well, if I liked it here.	35	1	4
540	 But then he started asking me about my mother.	35	1	4
541	 - Your mother? - Who she was, what she looked like.	35	1	4
542	 What did you tell him?	35	1	4
543	 She died when I was little.	35	1	4
544	 She had yellow hair.	35	1	4
545	 She'd sing to me sometimes.	35	1	4
546	 Look at me.	35	1	4
547	 Get back to work, lad.	36	1	4
548	 If the day ever comes when that boy	36	1	4
549	 would rather wield a sword than forge one,	36	1	4
550	 you send him to me.	36	1	4
551	 Find anything?	36	1	4
552	 King Robert's bastard son.	36	1	4
553	 He likes that.	36	1	4
554	 This is for the King from Lord Stark.	36	1	4
555	 Should I leave it with--	36	1	4
556	 shhh.	36	1	4
557	 Listen.	36	1	4
558	 Do you hear them?	36	1	4
559	 How many do you think are in there with him?	36	1	4
560	 Huh?	36	1	4
561	 - Guess. - Three?	36	1	4
562	 Four.	36	1	4
563	 He likes to do this when I'm on duty--	37	1	4
564	 he makes me listen as he insults my sister.	37	1	4
565	 Forgive me, My Lord--	37	1	4
566	 Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?	37	1	4
567	 We've met before, you know.	37	1	4
568	 Have we? Strange, I've forgotten.	37	1	4
569	 The siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.	37	1	4
570	 Ah.	37	1	4
571	 - That's where you got your scar? - Aye.	37	1	4
572	 Oh.	37	1	4
573	 One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.	37	1	4
574	 - Vicious sons of whores. - They like their bloodshed.	37	1	4
575	 They stopped liking it at the end.	37	1	4
576	 That was a proper battle. Do you remember	37	1	4
577	 Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?	37	1	4
578	 With his burning sword?	37	1	4
579	 I'll remember that till the day I die.	37	1	4
580	 I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell.	37	1	4
581	 It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.	37	1	4
582	 Theon? He's a good lad.	37	1	4
583	 I doubt it.	38	1	4
584	 I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam!	38	1	4
585	 Let me smell it. Come here.	38	1	4
586	 Can I leave this with you?	38	1	4
587	 The message from Lord Stark.	38	1	4
588	 I don't serve Lord Stark.	38	1	4
589	 - Where have you been? - Watch duty.	38	1	4
590	 - With Sam. - Ah, prince porkchop.	38	1	4
591	 - Where is he? - He wasn't hungry.	38	1	4
592	 Impossible!	38	1	4
593	 That's enough.	38	1	4
594	 Sam's no different from the rest of us.	39	1	4
595	 There was no place for him in the world,	39	1	4
596	 so he's come here.	39	1	4
597	 We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore.	39	1	4
598	 Never again, no matter what Thorne says.	39	1	4
599	 He's our brother now and we're going to protect him.	39	1	4
600	 You are in love, Lord Snow.	39	1	4
601	 You girls can do as you please.	39	1	4
602	 But if Thorne puts me up against lady piggy,	39	1	4
603	 I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.	39	1	4
604	 No one touches Sam.	39	1	4
605	 What are you waiting for?	40	1	4
606	 Attack him!	40	1	4
607	 You get in there.	40	1	4
608	 Hit me.	40	1	4
609	 Go on, hit me!	40	1	4
610	 I yield!	40	1	4
611	 Yield yield.	41	1	4
612	 I yield.	41	1	4
613	 You think this is funny, do you?	41	1	4
614	 When you're out there	41	1	4
615	 beyond The Wall with the sun going down,	41	1	4
616	 do you want a man at your back?	41	1	4
617	 Or a sniveling boy?	41	1	4
618	 You send this whore to give me commands?	41	1	4
619	 I should have sent you back her head!	41	1	4
620	 Forgive me, Khaleesi. I did as you asked.	41	1	4
621	 Hush now. It's all right.	41	1	4
622	 - Irri, take her and leave us. - Yes, Khaleesi.	41	1	4
623	 - Why did you hit her?! - How many times do I have to tell you?	41	1	4
624	 You do not command me.	41	1	4
625	 I wasn't commanding you.	42	1	4
626	 I just wanted to invite you to supper.	42	1	4
627	 - What's this? - It's a gift.	42	1	4
628	 - I had it made for you. - Dothraki rags?	42	1	4
629	 - Are you going to dress me now? - Please.	42	1	4
630	 This stinks of manure. All of it.	42	1	4
631	 Stop-- stop it.	42	1	4
632	 You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you?	42	1	4
633	 Next you'll want to braid my hair.	42	1	4
634	 You've no right to a braid.	42	1	4
635	 You've won no victories yet.	42	1	4
636	 You do not talk back to me!	42	1	4
637	 You are a horselord's slut.	42	1	4
638	 And now you've woken the dragon--	42	1	4
639	 I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki!	42	1	4
640	 I am the wife of the great Khal	42	1	4
641	 and I carry his son inside me.	42	1	4
642	 The next time you raise a hand to me	42	1	4
643	 will be the last time you have hands.	42	1	4
644	 I know for a fact that some of the officers	43	1	4
645	 go to that brothel in mole's town.	43	1	4
646	 I wouldn't doubt it.	43	1	4
647	 Don't you think it's a little bit unfair?	43	1	4
648	 Making us take our vows while they sneak off	43	1	4
649	 for a little sally on the side?	43	1	4
650	 - Sally on the side? - It's silly, isn't it?	43	1	4
651	 What, we can't defend the wall unless we're celibate?	43	1	4
652	 It's absurd.	43	1	4
653	 I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.	43	1	4
654	 Why not?	43	1	4
655	 - Because I'm fat? - No.	43	1	4
656	 But I like girls just as much as you do.	43	1	4
657	 They might not like me as much.	43	1	4
658	 I've never-- been with one.	43	1	4
659	 You've probably had hundreds.	43	1	4
660	 No.	43	1	4
661	 As a matter of fact,	43	1	4
662	 I'm the same as you.	44	1	4
663	 Yeah.	44	1	4
664	 I find that hard to believe.	44	1	4
665	 I came very close once.	44	1	4
666	 I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but--	44	1	4
667	 you didn't know where to put it?	44	1	4
668	 I know where to put it.	44	1	4
669	 Was she...	44	1	4
670	 Old and ugly?	44	1	4
671	 Young and gorgeous.	44	1	4
672	 A whore named Ros.	44	1	4
673	 What color hair?	44	1	4
674	 - Red. - Oh, I like red hair.	44	1	4
675	 And her, um...	44	1	4
676	 Her...	44	1	4
677	 - You don't want to know. - That good?	44	1	4
678	 - Better. - Oh no.	44	1	4
679	 So why exactly	44	1	4
680	 did you not make love to Ros with the perfect--?	44	1	4
681	 What's my name?	44	1	4
682	 Jon Snow?	44	1	4
683	 And why is my surname snow?	45	1	4
684	 Because...	45	1	4
685	 You're a bastard from the North.	45	1	4
686	 I never met my mother.	45	1	4
687	 My father wouldn't even tell me her name.	45	1	4
688	 I don't know if she's living or dead.	45	1	4
689	 I don't know if she's a noblewoman	45	1	4
690	 or a Fisherman's wife...	45	1	4
691	 Or a whore.	45	1	4
692	 So I sat there	45	1	4
693	 in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes.	45	1	4
694	 But I couldn't do it.	45	1	4
695	 Because all I could think was	45	1	4
696	 what if I got her pregnant	45	1	4
697	 and she had a child,	45	1	4
698	 another bastard named Snow?	45	1	4
699	 It's not a good life for a child.	45	1	4
700	 Ah, mmm.	46	1	4
701	 So...	46	1	4
702	 You didn't know where to put it?	46	1	4
703	 Enjoying yourselves?	46	1	4
704	 You look cold, boys.	46	1	4
705	 It is a bit nippy.	46	1	4
706	 A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire,	46	1	4
707	 indoors. It's still summer.	46	1	4
708	 Do you boys even remember the last winter?	46	1	4
709	 How long has it been now? What, 10 years?	46	1	4
710	 I remember.	46	1	4
711	 Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell?	46	1	4
712	 Were there days when you just couldn't get warm,	46	1	4
713	 never mind how many fires your servants built?	46	1	4
714	 - I build my own fires. - That's admirable.	46	1	4
715	 I spent six months out there, beyond The Wall	46	1	4
716	 during the last winter.	47	1	4
717	 It was supposed to be a two-week mission.	47	1	4
718	 We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch.	47	1	4
719	 So we went out to look for some of his men--	47	1	4
720	 capture them, gather some knowledge.	47	1	4
721	 The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men.	47	1	4
722	 Harder than you'll ever be.	47	1	4
723	 They know their country better than we do.	47	1	4
724	 They knew there was a storm coming in.	47	1	4
725	 So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass.	47	1	4
726	 And we got caught in the open.	47	1	4
727	 Wind so strong	47	1	4
728	 it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground,	47	1	4
729	 roots and all. If you took your gloves off	47	1	4
730	 to find your cock to have a piss,	47	1	4
731	 you lost a finger to the frost.	47	1	4
732	 And all in darkness.	47	1	4
733	 You don't know cold.	47	1	4
734	 Neither of you do.	48	1	4
735	 The horses died first.	48	1	4
736	 We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm.	48	1	4
737	 Eating the horses was easy.	48	1	4
738	 But later when we started to fall...	48	1	4
739	 That wasn't easy.	48	1	4
740	 We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we?	48	1	4
741	 Soft, fat boys like you.	48	1	4
742	 We'd have lasted a fortnight on you	48	1	4
743	 and still had bones leftover for soup.	48	1	4
744	 Soon we'll have new recruits	48	1	4
745	 and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander	48	1	4
746	 for assignment	48	1	4
747	 and they will call you men of The Night's Watch,	48	1	4
748	 but you'd be fools to believe it.	49	1	4
749	 You're boys still.	49	1	4
750	 And come the winter you will die...	49	1	4
751	 Like flies.	49	1	4
752	 I hit him.	49	1	4
753	 I hit the dragon.	49	1	4
754	 Your brother Rhaegar was the Last Dragon.	49	1	4
755	 Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.	49	1	4
756	 He is still the true king.	49	1	4
757	 The truth now:	49	1	4
758	 Do you want to see your brother sitting on the Iron Throne?	49	1	4
759	 No.	49	1	4
760	 But the common people are waiting for him.	49	1	4
761	 Illyrio said they are sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.	49	1	4
762	 The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends.	49	1	4
763	 They don't care what games the high lords play.	49	1	4
764	 What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?	50	1	4
765	 Home.	50	1	4
766	 I pray for home too.	50	1	4
767	 My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms.	50	1	4
768	 He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one.	50	1	4
769	 He'll never take us home.	50	1	4
770	 Lover's quarrel?	50	1	4
771	 I'm sorry. Do I...?	50	1	4
772	 Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. He's known--	50	1	4
773	 an old friend of the family.	51	1	4
774	 I've known your mother a long long time.	51	1	4
775	 - Why do they call you Littlefinger? - Arya!	51	1	4
776	 - Don't be rude! - No, it's quite all right.	51	1	4
777	 When I was a child I was very small	51	1	4
778	 and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers,	51	1	4
779	 so you see,	51	1	4
780	 it's an exceedingly clever nickname.	51	1	4
781	 I've been sitting here for days!	51	1	4
782	 Start the damn joust	51	1	4
783	 before I piss myself!	51	1	4
784	 Gods, who is that?	51	1	4
785	 Ser Gregor Clegane.	51	1	4
786	 They call him the Mountain.	51	1	4
787	 The hound's older brother.	51	1	4
788	 - And his opponent? -  Ser Hugh of the Vale.	51	1	4
789	 He was Jon Arryn's squire.	51	1	4
790	 Lo how far he's come.	51	1	4
791	 Yes yes, enough of the bloody pomp.	52	1	4
792	 Have at it!	52	1	4
793	 Not what you were expecting?	53	1	4
794	 Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound?	53	1	4
795	 Lovely little tale of brotherly love.	53	1	4
796	 The Hound was just a pup,	53	1	4
797	 six years old maybe.	53	1	4
798	 Gregor a few years older--	53	1	4
799	 already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation.	53	1	4
800	 Some lucky boys	53	1	4
801	 just born with a talent for violence.	54	1	4
802	 One evening Gregor found his little brother	54	1	4
803	 playing with a toy by the fire--	54	1	4
804	 Gregor's toy,	54	1	4
805	 a wooden knight.	54	1	4
806	 Gregor never said a word,	54	1	4
807	 he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck	54	1	4
808	 and shoved his face into the burning coals.	54	1	4
809	 Held him there	54	1	4
810	 while the boy screamed,	54	1	4
811	 while his face melted.	54	1	4
812	 There aren't very many people who know that story.	54	1	4
813	 I won't tell anyone. I promise.	54	1	4
814	 No, please don't.	54	1	4
815	 If the Hound so much as heard you mention it,	54	1	4
816	 I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing	54	1	4
817	 would not be able to save you.	54	1	4
818	 My Lord, her Grace the Queen.	55	1	4
819	 - Your Grace. - You're missing your tournament.	55	1	4
820	 Putting my name on it doesn't make it mine.	55	1	4
821	 I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us--	55	1	4
822	 the ugliness with the wolves.	55	1	4
823	 And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme.	55	1	4
824	 Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned.	55	1	4
825	 How is Sansa?	55	1	4
826	 She likes it here.	55	1	4
827	 She's the only Stark who does.	55	1	4
828	 Favors her mother,	55	1	4
829	 not much of the North in her.	55	1	4
830	 - What are you doing here? - I might ask the same of you.	55	1	4
831	 What is it you hope to accomplish?	55	1	4
832	 The King called on me to serve him and the realm,	55	1	4
833	 and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise.	55	1	4
834	 You can't change him. You can't help him.	56	1	4
835	 He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done.	56	1	4
836	 You'll try your best to pick up the pieces.	56	1	4
837	 If that's my job, then so be it.	56	1	4
838	 You're just a soldier, aren't you?	56	1	4
839	 You take your orders and you carry on.	56	1	4
840	 I suppose it makes sense.	56	1	4
841	 Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow.	56	1	4
842	 I was also trained to kill my enemies, your Grace.	56	1	4
843	 As was I.	56	1	4
844	 Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!	56	1	4
845	 And to you.	56	1	4
846	 Boy! Bread, meat and beer. Quickly.	57	1	4
847	 Ah, good idea, grandfather. I'm starving.	57	1	4
848	 A song while we wait or--?	57	1	4
849	 I'd rather throw myself down a well.	57	1	4
850	 Now now, grandfather, this may be your last chance if you're heading North.	57	1	4
851	 The only music the Northerners know is the howling of wolves!	57	1	4
852	 Gods.	57	1	4
853	 I'm sorry, My Lord. We're full up.	57	1	4
854	 - Every room. -  My men can sleep in the stable.	57	1	4
855	 As for myself, I don't require a large room.	57	1	4
856	 Truly, My Lord, we have nothing.	57	1	4
857	 Is there nothing I can do...	57	1	4
858	 ...To remedy this?	57	1	4
859	 You can have my room.	57	1	4
860	 Now there's a clever man.	57	1	4
861	 You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me.	57	1	4
862	 - Aye, My Lord. - My Lord of Lannister!	57	1	4
863	 Might I entertain you while you eat?	57	1	4
864	 I can sing of your father's victory at King's Landing!	57	1	4
865	 Nothing would more likely ruin my supper.	57	1	4
866	 Lady Stark!	57	1	4
867	 What an unexpected pleasure.	57	1	4
868	 I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.	58	1	4
869	 Lady Stark!	58	1	4
870	 I was still Catelyn Tully	58	1	4
871	 the last time I stayed here.	58	1	4
872	 You, Ser,	58	1	4
873	 is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?	58	1	4
874	 It is, My Lady.	58	1	4
875	 And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend	58	1	4
876	 to my father, Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?	58	1	4
877	 She is.	58	1	4
878	 The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun.	58	1	4
879	 My father counts Jonas Bracken	58	1	4
880	 amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.	58	1	4
881	 Our lord is honored by his trust.	58	1	4
882	 I envy your father	58	1	4
883	 all his fine friends, Lady Stark,	58	1	4
884	 but I don't quite see the purpose of this.	59	1	4
885	 I know your sigil as well--	59	1	4
886	 the Twin Towers of Frey.	59	1	4
887	 How fares your lord, Ser?	59	1	4
888	 Lord Walder is well, My Lady.	59	1	4
889	 He has asked your father for the honor of his presence	59	1	4
890	 on his 90th Nameday.	59	1	4
891	 He plans to take another wife.	59	1	4
892	 This man	59	1	4
893	 came into my house as a guest	59	1	4
894	 and there conspired to murder my son,	59	1	4
895	 a boy of 10.	59	1	4
896	 In the name of King Robert and the good lords you serve,	59	1	4
897	 I call upon you to seize him	59	1	4
898	 and help me return him to Winterfell	59	1	4
899	 to await the King's Justice.	59	1	4

9	 This ship sent to Old Town and	4	5	4
10	 we'll get off here not far from Sunspear.	4	5	4
11	 Row ourselves to the Dornish shores overnight.	4	5	4
12	 Have you ever been in Dorne?	4	5	4
13	 - No. - I Have	4	5	4
14	 The Dornish are crazy.	4	5	4
15	 All they want to do is fight and fuck,	4	5	4
16	 - fuck and fight. - You should be happy to go back there.	4	5	4
17	 There's nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking.	4	5	4
18	 And there's nothing like a fuck mad Dornish girl	4	5	4
19	 to clear your head for the next fight.	4	5	4
20	 It's how the two work together.	4	5	4
21	 Now we're gonna be doing a lot of fighting I'm sure.	4	5	4
22	 Well I am.	4	5	4
23	 But I don't imagine we'll get to stick around for the rest.	4	5	4
24	 Not after we've kidnapped their princess.	4	5	4
25	 We're not kidnapping their princess,	5	5	4
26	 We're rescuing my niece, bringing her back to her family.	5	5	4
27	 Your niece?	5	5	4
28	 I've been doing this sort of thing a long time.	5	5	4
29	 I'm good at it.	5	5	4
30	 - That's why you're here - I know.	5	5	4
31	 Why are you here?	5	5	4
32	 Why not send 40 mercenaries?	5	5	4
33	 ...or an army?	5	5	4
34	 Unlike most folks, you've actually got one.	5	5	4
35	 Because I do not want to start a war.	5	5	4
36	 That still doesn't explain what you're doing here.	5	5	4
37	 It has to be me.	5	5	4
38	 If I'm putting something like this together.	5	5	4
39	 A one-handed man	5	5	4
40	 who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros	5	5	4
41	 - No... - It has to be me.	5	5	4
42	 You set your brother free, didn't you...	6	5	4

44	 Varys, set him free.	6	5	4
45	 Well...	6	5	4
46	 If you ever see that wee little fucker,	6	5	4

53	 Given the expense of rebuilding the royal	7	5	4
54	 - roof... - How much can the Crown afford?	7	5	4
55	 With Winter coming...	7	5	4
56	 half what they ask.	7	5	4
57	 ...maybe less.	7	5	4
58	 You're Master of coin. How do we pay them?	7	5	4
59	 Well, House Tyrell could front the money,	7	5	4
60	 The Crown would pay us back in time	7	5	4
61	 or I'll have words with my daughter.	7	5	4
62	 You have already given us too much.	7	5	4
63	 No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank.	7	5	4
64	 Absolutely.	7	5	4
65	 In person.	7	5	4
66	 Me?	7	5	4
67	 We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone with importance	7	5	4
68	 to show these bankers our respect.	7	5	4
69	 As the King's Master of Coin, I can thinik of no one more qualified.	7	5	4
70	 I would be honored, your Grace.	7	5	4
71	 The Kings expressed concern about his father in laws safety on this voyage.	7	5	4
72	 He's ordered Ser Meryn...	8	5	4
73	 to personally lead your escort.	8	5	4
74	 A member of the Kings Guard?	8	5	4
75	 - Please, I... - Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.	8	5	4
76	 Of course, of course...	8	5	4
77	 I'll give your regards to the Titan of Braavos.	8	5	4
78	 The small council grows smaller and smaller	8	5	4
79	 Not small enough.	8	5	4
80	 May I offer you some wine, your holiness?	8	5	4
81	 No.	9	5	4
82	 The old High Septon would've asked for the vintage.	9	5	4
83	 I could say that our minds are the temples to the Seven...	9	5	4
84	 and should be kept clear.	9	5	4
85	 But, truth is...	9	5	4
86	 I don't like the taste.	9	5	4
87	 How may I server you?	9	5	4
88	 All over Westeros, we hear of temples being burned...	9	5	4
89	 Silence Sister's raped...	9	5	4
90	 bodies of holy men piled in the streets.	9	5	4
91	 Wars teach people to obey the sword...	9	5	4
92	 not the Gods.	9	5	4
93	 Perhaps the gods need a sword of their own.	9	5	4
94	 In the days before the Targaryens, the faith militant	9	5	4
95	 dispensed the justices of the Seven.	9	5	4
96	 The faith militant was dissolved more than two centuries ago.	9	5	4
97	 If I explain the holy purpose to my son, the King	9	5	4
98	 I have no doubt he will sign a decree, arming the believers you feel worthy.	10	5	4
99	 An army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people?	10	5	4
100	 An army in service to the Gods themselves.	10	5	4
101	 and to you, of course...	10	5	4
102	 as the chosen representative of the Seven.	10	5	4
103	 An honor I never expected...	10	5	4
104	 or a deed ever wished for.	10	5	4
105	" And ""why you were chosen."	10	5	4
106	 You and I know both how the world works.	10	5	4
107	 Too often, the wicked or the wealthiest	10	5	4
108	 are beyond the reach of justice.	10	5	4
109	 The King himself can't always punish those who deserve it most.	10	5	4
110	 All sinners are equal before the gods.	10	5	4
111	 What would you say if I told you of a great sinner in our very midst	10	5	4
112	 shielded by gold and privilege.	10	5	4
113	 May the Father judge in justice.	11	5	4
114	 Get up!	11	5	4
115	 Help me!    Help Me!	11	5	4
116	 Get off me!	12	5	4
117	 Shut up!	12	5	4
118	 This is Lord Petyr Baylish's establishment.	12	5	4
119	 Cock Suck!	12	5	4
120	 Boy Fucker!	12	5	4
121	 You buggering filth!	12	5	4
122	 There is a special place in the Seventh Hell for your kind.	13	5	4
123	 Please...	13	5	4
124	 Please! I'll pay!	13	5	4
125	 I... I'll pay all of you!	13	5	4
126	 Yes you will.	13	5	4
127	 Seize him.	13	5	4
128	 Get your hands off of me! -Sir Loras of House Tyrell...	13	5	4
129	 you have broken the laws of Gods and men.	14	5	4
130	 Who do you think you are?	14	5	4
131	 Justice.	14	5	4
132	 Why is my brother in a cell?	14	5	4
133	 I... I don't know.	14	5	4
134	 I... I didn't do it.	14	5	4
135	 We both know who did.	14	5	4
136	 You told me she was returning to Casterly Rock.	14	5	4
137	 You say your mothers behind this?	14	5	4
138	 She's jealous you're not hers anymore	14	5	4
139	 aresting my brother is her revenge.	14	5	4
140	 Aren't you and mother getting along?	14	5	4
141	 Oh, my sweet...	14	5	4
142	 Sweet King.	14	5	4
143	 Do you have any affection for me at all?	15	5	4
144	 Of course I do	15	5	4
145	 you're my Queen.	15	5	4
146	 I can't bear to think that my brother is locked in some grimy cell.	15	5	4
147	 I'll set him free for you.	15	5	4
148	 Do you promise?	15	5	4
149	 I demand that Ser Loras be freed, now.	15	5	4
150	 Did I arrest him?	15	5	4
151	 Well... no.	15	5	4
152	 But, y-you armed the faith militant.	15	5	4
153	 You gave the High Sparrow an army!	15	5	4
154	 I did.	15	5	4
155	 And your wife has every right to criticize.	15	5	4
156	 We can not allow fanatics to arrest the Queens brother	15	5	4
157	 no matter his perversions.	16	5	4
158	 Then...	16	5	4
159	 Can I tell Margaery you'll have Sir Loras released?	16	5	4
160	 I told you, I'm not holding Sir Loras.	16	5	4
161	 You're the King	16	5	4
162	 I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow,	16	5	4
163	 he'll release the poor boy.	16	5	4
164	 <I> Halt! </ I>	16	5	4
165	 His Holiness is praying.	16	5	4
166	 He will not be disturbed.	16	5	4
167	 Give the order, and we'll clear out this rebel. .	17	5	4
168	 You mean...	17	5	4
169	 kill them?	17	5	4
170	 Him? The Septon?	17	5	4
171	 You'll be sending them to meet the Gods that they love.	17	5	4
172	 <I> Bastard! </I>	17	5	4
173	 <I> You are an abomination! </I>	17	5	4
174	 <I> You're born of sin! </I>	17	5	4
175	 <I> Filthy Bastard! </I>	17	5	4
176	 We'll find another way.	17	5	4
177	 <I> Abomination! </I>	17	5	4
178	 My Queen?	17	5	4
179	 There was no way to free Ser Loras without violence.	18	5	4
180	 You're the King of the Andals.	18	5	4
181	 The Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, the Protector of the Realm.	18	5	4
182	 And you let a band of fanatics imprison your brother by law.	18	5	4
183	 - I'm going to speak with the High Sparrow. - Are you? When?	18	5	4
184	 - I don't know... - You don't know?	18	5	4
185	 He was praying... just now.	18	5	4
186	 I have to send word to Grandmother.	18	5	4
187	 Will come back later?	18	5	4
188	 I need to be with my family, Your Grace.	18	5	4
189	 Of course...	18	5	4
190	 - You think highly of this boy? -  Good! 	19	5	4
191	 Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.	19	5	4
192	 It is a bastard by some tavern slut.	19	5	4
193	 Perhaps. But that wasn't Ned Starks way.	19	5	4
194	 I should've given you a son.	19	5	4
195	 - Not your fault - Who's then?	19	5	4
196	 I gave him nothing but weakness	19	5	4
197	 and deformity.	19	5	4
198	 Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light.	19	5	4
199	 My Lady.	19	5	4
200	 Her father's the Lords chosen King.	19	5	4
201	 And her father's blood runs through her veins.	19	5	4
202	 You march on Winterfell soon?	20	5	4
203	 We must.	20	5	4
204	 To beat the Snow's.	20	5	4
205	 Once before, you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind.	20	5	4
206	 I hope you won't make that mistake again.	20	5	4
207	 I won't.	20	5	4
208	 I need you.	20	5	4
209	 You only need faith, My King.	20	5	4
210	 And you, my lady, what do you need?	20	5	4
211	 To serve my Lord.	20	5	4
212	 Lord Ashford	20	5	4
213	 Lady Caulfield	20	5	4
214	 Lord Smallwood	21	5	4
215	 - Never even heard of these people. - They haven't heard of you either.	21	5	4
216	 But we need men, and they have some.	21	5	4
217	 How many men does this, Lord Mason, have to send us?	21	5	4
218	 More than Lord Webbly.	21	5	4
219	 - Not him. - I know..	21	5	4
220	 I'm sorry. But we need men, and supplies, and	21	5	4
221	 - Roose Bolton's the Warden of the North - He murdered my brother.	21	5	4
222	 We swore to be the watcher's on the wall.	21	5	4
223	 We can't watch the wall with fifty men,	21	5	4
224	 and we can't get more men without help from the Warden of the North.	21	5	4
225	 Apologies my lady.	22	5	4
226	 Lord Commander.	22	5	4
227	 How can I help you?	22	5	4
228	 Come with us when we ride South.	22	5	4
229	 None of us know the castle as well as you do.	22	5	4
230	 Its hidden tunnels...	22	5	4
231	 its weaknesses, its people.	22	5	4
232	 Winterfell was your home once,	23	5	4
233	 don't you want to chase the rats out of it?	23	5	4
234	 Castle Black is my home now.	23	5	4
235	 The Night's Watch take no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdom's.	23	5	4
236	 There's only one war.	23	5	4
237	 Life against death.	23	5	4
238	 Come...	23	5	4
239	 Let me show you what you're fighting for.	23	5	4
240	 You gonna show me some vision in the fire.	23	5	4
241	 Forgive me my lady...	23	5	4
242	 I don't trust in visions.	23	5	4
243	 No visions.	23	5	4
244	 No magic.	23	5	4
245	 Just life...	23	5	4
246	 Do you feel my heart beating?	24	5	4
247	 This power in you...	24	5	4
248	 you resisted, and that's your mistake.	24	5	4
249	 Embrace it.	24	5	4
250	 The Lord of Light made us male and female.	24	5	4
251	 Two parts of a greater whole.	24	5	4
252	 You're not joining	24	5	4
253	 this power.	24	5	4
254	 The power to make life.	24	5	4
255	 Power to make light.	24	5	4
256	 And the power to cast shadows...	24	5	4
257	 I don't think Stannis, would like that very much.	24	5	4
258	 Then we shouldn't tell.	25	5	4
259	 I can't.	25	5	4
260	 Why?	25	5	4
261	 I swore a vow.	25	5	4
262	 I loved another...	25	5	4
263	 The Death don't need lovers,	25	5	4
264	 only living.	25	5	4
265	 I know...	25	5	4
266	 but I still love her.	25	5	4
267	 You know nothing, Jon Snow.	25	5	4
268	 Are you lonely?	26	5	4
269	 Just bored.	26	5	4
270	 My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources.	26	5	4
271	 Were you bored a lot too?	26	5	4
272	 I know Castle Black...	26	5	4
273	 - is no place for a child. But I... - I like it!	26	5	4
274	 I thought I'd be left at home.	27	5	4
275	 I know mother didn't want to bring me.	27	5	4
276	 Why'd you say that?	27	5	4
277	" She told me, ""I don't want to bring you."""	27	5	4
278	 She shouldn't have said that.	27	5	4
279	 Are you ashamed of me, father?	27	5	4
280	 When you were an infant...	27	5	4
281	 A Dornish trader landed on Dragonstone.	27	5	4
282	 His goods were junk, except for... one wooden doll.	27	5	4
283	 We even sowed a dress on it, in the colors of our house.	27	5	4
284	 No doubt you've heard of your birth.	28	5	4
285	 And assumed new father's were easy targets.	28	5	4
286	 I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle,	28	5	4
287	 and you pressed it to your cheek.	28	5	4
288	 By the time we burned the doll, it was too late.	28	5	4
289	 I was told you would die,	28	5	4
290	 or worse...	28	5	4
291	 the grey scale would go slow.	28	5	4
292	 That you'd grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you.	28	5	4
293	 Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valirya	28	5	4
294	 to live out your short life with the Stone Men,	28	5	4
295	 before the sickness spread through the castle.	29	5	4
296	 I told them all to go to hell.	29	5	4
297	 I called in every maestro on this side of the world.	29	5	4
298	 Every Healer...	29	5	4
299	 every Apothecary.	29	5	4
300	 They stopped the disease and saved your life.	29	5	4
301	 Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone Men.	29	5	4
302	 You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon.	29	5	4
303	 And you are my daughter.	29	5	4
304	 I thought I might find you here.	30	5	4
305	 Your Aunt Lyanna...	30	5	4
306	 Father never talked about her.	31	5	4
307	 Sometimes, I'd find him down here lighting the candles.	31	5	4
308	 They say she was beautiful.	31	5	4
309	 I saw her once.	31	5	4
310	 I was a boy, living with your mother's family.	31	5	4
311	 Lord Whent of the Great Tourney at Arrenhal.	31	5	4
312	 Everyone was there...	31	5	4
313	 the Mad King,	31	5	4
314	 your father,	31	5	4
315	 Robert Baratheon,	31	5	4
316	 and Lyanna.	31	5	4
317	 She was already promised to Robert.	31	5	4
318	 You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere...	31	5	4
319	 nothing to his name...	31	5	4
320	 watching these legendary men	31	5	4
321	 tilting of the lists.	31	5	4
322	 The last two rider's were...	31	5	4
323	 Barristan Selmy and Rheagar Targaryen.	31	5	4
324	 When Rheagar won, everyone cheered for their Prince.	31	5	4
325	 I remember I was laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair.	32	5	4
326	 How handsome he was.	32	5	4
327	 Until he rode right past his wife,	32	5	4
328	 Elia Martell,	32	5	4
329	 and all the smiles died.	32	5	4
330	 Never seen so many people so quiet.	32	5	4
331	 He rode past his wife	32	5	4
332	 and he laid a crown with winter roses in Lyanna's lap.	32	5	4
333	 Blue was frost.	32	5	4
334	 How many tens of thousands had to die because Rheagar chose your aunt?	32	5	4
335	 Yes... he chose them,	32	5	4
336	 and then kidnapped her, and raped her.	32	5	4
337	 Come	33	5	4
338	 Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us.	33	5	4
339	 Dressed for riding...	33	5	4
340	 I am.	33	5	4
341	 Where are you going?	33	5	4
342	 King's Landing.	33	5	4
343	 King's Landing?	33	5	4
344	 Cersei sent for me.	33	5	4
345	 We mustn't let her sniff out any trouble.	33	5	4
346	 You can't leave me here!	33	5	4
347	 You know how hard it is to get with people you despise, believe me.	33	5	4
348	 But it won't be for long.	33	5	4
349	 How do you know?	33	5	4
350	 Stannis Baratheon garrisons the Castle Black.	33	5	4
351	 He'll march South to King's Landing before the Winter snow block his way.	33	5	4
352	 But first,	33	5	4
353	 he has to take Winterfell.	33	5	4
354	 You don't konw that.	33	5	4
355	 I do.	33	5	4
356	 Once he liberates these lands from the Bolton's,	34	5	4
357	 he'll rally your fathers bannermen to his cause	34	5	4
358	 with the North behind them.	34	5	4
359	 Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne.	34	5	4
360	 You think he'll defeat the Bolton's?	34	5	4
361	 He has a larger army,	34	5	4
362	 and the finest military commander in Westeros.	34	5	4
363	 A betting man, would put his money on Stannis.	34	5	4
364	 As it happens, I am a betting man.	34	5	4
365	 And if you're right?	34	5	4
366	 Stannis takes Winterfell,	34	5	4
367	 he rescues you from the most despised family in the North.	34	5	4
368	 Grateful for your late father's courageous support of his claim...	34	5	4
369	 he names you... Wardeness of the North.	34	5	4
370	 But I...	34	5	4
371	 I wouldn't...	34	5	4
372	 Wardeness of the North?	34	5	4
373	 You are the last surviving Stark.	34	5	4
374	 He needs you.	34	5	4
375	 And what if you're wrong? What if Stannis never attacked Winterfell	34	5	4
376	 or he does, and the Bolton's defeat him?	35	5	4
377	 Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramses, and make him yours.	35	5	4
378	 - I don't know how to do that. - Of course you do.	35	5	4
379	 He's already fallen for you.	35	5	4
380	 His father frightens me.	35	5	4
381	 And he should...	35	5	4
382	 he's a dangerous man.	35	5	4
383	 But even the most dangerous men, can be outmaneuvered.	35	5	4
384	 And you've learned to manouver from the very best.	35	5	4
385	 I'll return before too long.	35	5	4
386	 You be strong, without me.	35	5	4
387	 The North will be yours.	35	5	4
388	 Do you believe me?	35	5	4
389	 I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.	35	5	4
390	 Breakfast?	37	5	4
391	 That would've been a shit way to die.	37	5	4
392	 As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die.	37	5	4
393	 <I> Aye.</I>	37	5	4
394	 But your lot have to give the singers a good ending.	37	5	4
395	 I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.	37	5	4
396	 No?	37	5	4
397	 Two knights, off to rescue a princess...	37	5	4
398	 - sounds like a good song to me. - Sounds like all the rest.	37	5	4
399	 What about you?	37	5	4
400	 What shit way would you choose?	37	5	4
401	 In my own Keep, drinking my own wine.	38	5	4
402	 Watching my son's grovel for a fortune.	38	5	4
403	 How disappointing...	38	5	4
404	 I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.	38	5	4
405	 I've had an exciting life...	38	5	4
406	 I want my death to be boring.	38	5	4
407	 And how do you want to go?	38	5	4
408	 In the arms of the woman I love.	38	5	4
409	 She want the same thing?	38	5	4
410	 Let's go.	38	5	4
411	 The captain of that ship...	38	5	4
412	 - what was he, Braavosi? - Pentosi?.	38	5	4
413	 - and he's headed to Old Town? - As I said...	39	5	4
414	 Why?	39	5	4
415	 What's to stop him from ducking down the coast...	39	5	4
416	 I tell the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?	39	5	4
417	 A bag of gold.	39	5	4
418	 I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.	39	5	4
419	 It was a heavy bag.	39	5	4
420	 And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it.	39	5	4
421	 But you won't be around if he breaks it.	39	5	4
422	 - How many do you count? - Four.	39	5	4
423	 And how many do you think you can take?	39	5	4
424	 One... if he's slow.	39	5	4
425	 Fucked in the ass.	39	5	4
426	 Morning lads!	40	5	4
427	 Glad we found you.	40	5	4
428	 Who are you?	40	5	4
429	 Cooper.	40	5	4
430	 And this is Darnell.	40	5	4
431	 - You're from King's Landing? - Accent gave me away.	40	5	4
432	 Flea Bottom. Whelped and whipped.	40	5	4
433	 Why are you here?	40	5	4
434	 Our ship capsized in the night. We managed to swim ashore.	40	5	4
435	 It's a near thing, really...	40	5	4
436	 Thought the sharks would get us.	40	5	4
437	 There are no sharks in Dorne.	40	5	4
438	 I could've sworn those were shark fins.	40	5	4
439	 Dolphin's, maybe.	40	5	4
440	 Throw your sword in the sand!	40	5	4
441	 Boys, there's no need for this.	41	5	4
442	 Just point us in the right direction, and we'll find our way home.	41	5	4
443	 Swords in the sand, now!	41	5	4
444	 That one should be slow enough.	41	5	4
445	 Nice move.	42	5	4
446	 ...Luck!	42	5	4
447	 You had a wonderful teacher.	42	5	4
448	 I always wanted a Dornish stallion.	43	5	4
449	 Beasts can run a day and night without tiring.	43	5	4
450	 We'll ride to the Water Garden's with a nice breeze in our face.	43	5	4
451	 But first, we need to bury these bodies.	43	5	4
452	 Birds have to eat too.	43	5	4
453	 Corpses raise questions, questions raise armies.	43	5	4
454	 We're not here to start a war.	43	5	4
455	 Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those hole's?	43	5	4
456	 I can't dig very well with one hand.	43	5	4
457	 Not at all, really.	43	5	4
458	 Momma.	44	5	4
459	 - Nym... Obara - Will it be war?	44	5	4
460	 Prince Doran will weep for your father, but nothing else.	44	5	4
461	 We must avenge Oberyn ourselves.	44	5	4
462	 Without Doran, we have no army to march against the Lannister's.	44	5	4
463	 We don't need an army to start a war.	44	5	4
464	 Queen Cersei loves her children...	44	5	4
465	 - ...and we have one of them. - We may have a problem.	44	5	4
466	 A ship's captain, who found me at Planky Town, claiming	45	5	4
467	 he had information to sell.	45	5	4
468	 He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne.	45	5	4
469	 He's come for Myrcella.	45	5	4
470	 If he gets to her before we do, we lose our only chance for revenge.	45	5	4
471	 You must choose...	45	5	4
472	 Doran's way and peace,	45	5	4
473	 or my way...	45	5	4
474	 and war.	45	5	4
475	 I'm with you. Always.	45	5	4
476	 Nym?	45	5	4
477	 Obara?	45	5	4
478	 When I was a child, Oberyn came to take me to court.	45	5	4
479	 I'd never seen this man, and yet he called himself my father.	46	5	4
480	 My mother wept, said I was too young,	46	5	4
481	 and a girl.	46	5	4
482	 Oberyn tossed his spear at my feet and said	46	5	4
483	" ""Girl or boy, we fight our battles."	46	5	4
484	" But the God's let us choose our weapons."""	46	5	4
485	 My father pointed to the spear,	46	5	4
486	 then to my mother's tears.	46	5	4
487	 I made my choice long ago.	46	5	4
488	 Thank you.	47	5	4
489	 Who are you?	47	5	4
490	 Your capture.	47	5	4
491	 Do you have wine?	47	5	4
492	 No.	47	5	4
493	 I can't sleep without wine.	47	5	4
494	 Then stay awake.	47	5	4
495	 You're going the wrong way.	47	5	4
496	 My sister's in Westeros.	48	5	4
497	 Westeros... is West!	48	5	4
498	 We're heading East...	48	5	4
499	 I'm not taking you to your sister.	48	5	4
500	 You said you were taking me to the Queen.	48	5	4
501	 I am.	48	5	4
502	 Queen Daenerys Targaryen.	48	5	4
503	 She's the Queen I serve.	48	5	4
504	 What a waste of a good kidnapping.	48	5	4
505	 So happens I was heading there myself!	48	5	4
506	 What business would you have with the Queen?	48	5	4
507	 Gold and glory?	48	5	4
508	 Oh, and hate.	48	5	4
509	 If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand.	48	5	4
510	 So...	48	5	4
511	 now that it's clear we're on the same side.	48	5	4
512	 A high born knight from the North of Westeros,	49	5	4
513	 down on his luck in Essos.	49	5	4
514	 Dragon epaulettes?	49	5	4
515	 Bear sigil breast fit.	49	5	4
516	 You're Jorah Mormont.	49	5	4
517	 I have to ask...	49	5	4
518	 how, exactly, were you serving your Queen	49	5	4
519	 in a whore house, half a world away?	49	5	4
520	 Is it possible, that you were running?	49	5	4
521	 Why would you be running?	49	5	4
522	 And why would she have sent you away?	49	5	4
523	 Oh, wait!	49	5	4
524	 You were spying on her, weren't you?	49	5	4
525	 It's all coming back to me!	49	5	4
526	 I was drunk through most of the small council meetings, but it's all coming back	49	5	4
527	 You passed notes to Varys' little birds.	49	5	4
528	 She found out, didn't she?	50	5	4
529	 Found out, and exiled you.	50	5	4
530	 And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift.	50	5	4
531	 A risky scheme...	50	5	4
532	 one might even say, desperate.	50	5	4
533	 Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you?	50	5	4
534	 I'd say the reverse is just as likely.	50	5	4
535	 Everyone looks happy enough from up here.	50	5	4
536	 What?	51	5	4
537	 I was thinking of all the times your brother made me	51	5	4
538	 go with him down from the Red Keep, into the streets of King's Landing.	51	5	4
539	 - Why? - He liked to walk among the people,	51	5	4
540	 he liked to sing to them.	51	5	4
541	 - He sang to them? - Yes. (laughs)	51	5	4
542	 Rhaegar would take a spot on the hook	51	5	4
543	 or ithe street of seeds... and then he'd sang.	51	5	4
544	 Just like all the other minstrels.	51	5	4
545	 - And what did you do? - I made sure no one killed him.	51	5	4
546	 And... I collected the money.	51	5	4
547	 Well... he liked to see how much he could make.	51	5	4
548	 - He was good? - He was very good.	51	5	4
549	 Viserys never told you?	51	5	4
550	 He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people.	51	5	4
551	 Rhaegar never liked killing...	51	5	4
552	 he loved to sing.	51	5	4
553	 And what did you do with the money?	51	5	4
554	 Well, one time, we gave it to the next minstrel down the street.	51	5	4
555	 One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom.	51	5	4
556	 One time...	52	5	4
557	 he got horribly drunk.	52	5	4
558	 Your Grace.	52	5	4
559	 Hizdahr is here, waiting in the audience chamber.	52	5	4
560	 How many others are there?	52	5	4
561	 Fifty... a hundred.	52	5	4
562	 Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?	52	5	4
563	 I... think I can protect you from Hizdhar Zo Loraq.	52	5	4
564	 I think I can protect me from Hizdhar Zo Loraq.	52	5	4
565	 Go, Ser Barristan.	52	5	4
566	 Sing a song for me.	52	5	4
567	 Your Grace.	52	5	4
568	 <I> All men must die. </I>	52	5	4
569	 - But not all can die in glory. - Glory?	52	5	4
570	 Why else do men fight?	52	5	4
571	 Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms?	52	5	4
572	 So their names would live on.	52	5	4
573	 Those who find victory in the fighting pits, will never become kings...	52	5	4
574	 but their names will live on.	53	5	4
575	 It's the best chance they'll ever have.	53	5	4
576	 Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to	53	5	4
577	 butchering each other for sport?	53	5	4
578	 His Grace, today is the traditional start of the fighting season.	53	5	4
579	 I do not recognize this tradition.	53	5	4
580	 Traditions, are the only thing that will hold this city...	53	5	4
581	 your city, together.	53	5	4
582	 Without them, former slaves and former masters have nothing in common.	53	5	4
583	 Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment.	53	5	4
584	 I can't promise this is the answer to all our problems...	53	5	4
585	 ...but it's a start.	53	5	4

36	" or be branded an enemy of the Crown."""	3	1	7
37	 Poor Ned Stark...	3	1	7
38	 Brave man, terrible judgment.	3	1	7
39	 Attacking him was stupid.	4	1	7
40	 Lannisters	4	1	7
41	 don't act like fools.	4	1	7
42	 Are you gonna say something clever?	4	1	7
43	 Go on, say something clever.	4	1	7
44	 Catelyn Stark took my brother.	4	1	7
45	 Why is he still alive?	4	1	7
46	 - Tyrion? - Ned Stark.	4	1	7
47	 One of our men interfered,	4	1	7
48	 speared him through the leg before I could finish him.	4	1	7
49	 Why is he still alive?	4	1	7
50	 - It wouldn't have been clean. - Clean.	4	1	7
51	 You spend too much time worrying about	4	1	7
52	 what other people think of you.	5	1	7
53	 I could care less what anyone thinks of me.	5	1	7
54	 That's what you want people to think of you.	5	1	7
55	 It's the truth.	5	1	7
56	 When you hear them whispering	5	1	7
57	" ""Kingslayer"" behind your back--"	5	1	7
58	 doesn't it bother you?	5	1	7
59	 Of course it bothers me.	5	1	7
60	 The lion doesn't concern himself	5	1	7
61	 with the opinions of the sheep.	5	1	7
62	 I suppose I should be grateful that your vanity	5	1	7
63	 got in the way of your recklessness.	5	1	7
64	 I'm giving you half of our forces--	5	1	7
65	 30,000 men.	5	1	7
66	 You will bring them to Catelyn Stark's girlhood home	5	1	7
67	 and remind her that Lannisters	5	1	7
68	 pay their debts.	5	1	7
69	 I didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life.	5	1	7
70	 He's a Lannister.	5	1	7
71	 He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us.	5	1	7
72	 And every day that he remains a prisoner,	5	1	7
73	 the less our name commands respect.	6	1	7
74	 So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of--	6	1	7
75	 No, it's not an opinion. It's a fact.	6	1	7
76	 If another House can seize one of our own	6	1	7
77	 and hold him captive with impunity,	6	1	7
78	 we are no longer a House to be feared.	6	1	7
79	 Your mother's dead.	6	1	7
80	 Before long I'll be dead.	6	1	7
81	 And you	6	1	7
82	 and your brother and your sister	6	1	7
83	 and all of her children. All of us dead;	6	1	7
84	 all of us rotting in the ground.	6	1	7
85	 It's the family name that lives on.	6	1	7
86	 It's all that lives on.	6	1	7
87	 Not your personal glory, not your honor,	6	1	7
88	 but family.	6	1	7
89	 Do you understand?	6	1	7
90	 Hmm.	6	1	7
91	 You're blessed with abilities that few men possess.	7	1	7
92	 You are blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the kingdoms.	7	1	7
93	 And you are still blessed with youth.	7	1	7
94	 And what have you done with these blessings, huh?	7	1	7
95	 You've served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings--	7	1	7
96	 one a madman, the other a drunk.	7	1	7
97	 The future of our family will be determined in these next few months.	7	1	7
98	 We could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years.	7	1	7
99	 Or we could collapse into nothing, as the Targaryens did.	7	1	7
100	 I need you to become the man you were always meant to be.	7	1	7
101	 Not next year. Not tomorrow.	7	1	7
102	 Now.	7	1	7
103	 You're in pain.	8	1	7
104	 I've had worse, My Lady.	8	1	7
105	 Perhaps it's time to go home.	8	1	7
106	 The South doesn't seem to agree with you.	8	1	7
107	 I know the truth Jon Arryn died for.	8	1	7
108	 Do you, Lord Stark?	8	1	7
109	 Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?	8	1	7
110	 Has he done this before?	8	1	7
111	 Jaime would have killed him.	8	1	7
112	 My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.	8	1	7
113	 Your brother...	9	1	7
114	 Or your lover?	9	1	7
115	 The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years	9	1	7
116	 to keep bloodlines pure.	9	1	7
117	 Jaime and I are more than brother and sister.	9	1	7
118	 We shared a womb.	9	1	7
119	 We came into this world together. We belong together.	9	1	7
120	 My son saw you with him.	9	1	7
121	 Do you love your children?	9	1	7
122	 - With all my heart. - No more than I love mine.	9	1	7
123	 - And they are all Jaime's. - Thank the Gods.	9	1	7
124	 In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores	9	1	7
125	 for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed,	9	1	7
126	 I finish him off in other ways.	9	1	7
127	 - In the morning, he doesn't remember. - You've always hated him.	9	1	7
128	 Hated him? I worshipped him.	9	1	7
129	 Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed of him,	9	1	7
130	 but he was mine by oath.	9	1	7
131	 And when I finally saw him	9	1	7
132	 on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor,	9	1	7
133	 lean and fierce and black-bearded,	10	1	7
134	 it was the happiest moment of my life.	10	1	7
135	 Then that night he crawled on top of me, stinking of wine	10	1	7
136	 and did what he did-- what little he could do--	10	1	7
137	" and whispered in my ear, ""Lyanna."""	10	1	7
138	 Your sister was a corpse and I was a living girl	10	1	7
139	 and he loved her more than me.	10	1	7
140	 When the King returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth.	10	1	7
141	 You must be gone by then-- you and your children.	10	1	7
142	 I will not have their blood on my hands.	10	1	7
143	 Go as far away as you can,	10	1	7
144	 with as many men as you can.	10	1	7
145	 Because wherever you go,	10	1	7
146	 Robert's wrath will follow you.	10	1	7
147	 And what of my wrath, Lord Stark?	10	1	7
148	 You should have taken the realm for yourself.	10	1	7
149	 Jaime told me about the day King's Landing fell.	10	1	7
150	 He was sitting in the Iron Throne and you made him give it up.	10	1	7
151	 All you needed to do was climb the steps yourself.	10	1	7
152	 Such a sad mistake.	11	1	7
153	 I've made many mistakes in my life,	11	1	7
154	 but that wasn't one of them.	11	1	7
155	 Oh, but it was.	11	1	7
156	 When you play the Game of Thrones, you win	11	1	7
157	 or you die.	11	1	7
158	 There is no middle ground.	11	1	7
159	 Come here.	11	1	7
160	 Oh yes, oh.	11	1	7
161	 Oh yes yes yes.	11	1	7
162	 No no no no!	12	1	7
163	 Is that what they teach you up in the North?	12	1	7
164	 And you-- wherever you're from,	12	1	7
165	 do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?	12	1	7
166	 Either of you understand a thing that I'm saying?	12	1	7
167	 Yes, My Lord.	12	1	7
168	 Let's start over, shall we?	12	1	7
169	 You be the man	12	1	7
170	 and you be the woman.	12	1	7
171	 Well, go ahead.	12	1	7
172	 Slowly.	12	1	7
173	 You're not fooling them. They just paid you.	12	1	7
174	 They know what you are.	13	1	7
175	 They know it's all just an act.	13	1	7
176	 Your job is to make them forget what they know.	13	1	7
177	 That takes time.	13	1	7
178	 You need to...	13	1	7
179	 Ease into it.	13	1	7
180	 Go ahead.	13	1	7
181	 Ease into it.	13	1	7
182	 He's winning you over in spite of yourself.	13	1	7
183	 You're starting to like this.	13	1	7
184	 He wants to believe you.	13	1	7
185	 He's enjoyed his cock since he was old enough to play with it.	13	1	7
186	 Why shouldn't you? He knows he's better than other men.	13	1	7
187	 He's always known it deep down inside. Now he has proof.	13	1	7
188	 He's so good,	13	1	7
189	 he's reaching something deep inside of you that	13	1	7
190	 no one even knew was there,	13	1	7
191	 overcoming your very nature.	14	1	7
192	 Why don't you join us, My Lord?	14	1	7
193	 I'm saving myself for another.	14	1	7
194	 What she doesn't know won't hurt her.	14	1	7
195	 A stupid saying.	14	1	7
196	 What we don't know is usually what gets us killed.	14	1	7
197	 She must be very beautiful.	14	1	7
198	 No, not really. Impeccable bloodlines though.	14	1	7
199	 I do believe My Lord's in love.	14	1	7
200	 For many years. Most of my life really.	14	1	7
201	 Play with her ass.	14	1	7
202	 And she loved me too.	14	1	7
203	 I was her little confidant,	14	1	7
204	 her plaything.	14	1	7
205	 She could tell me anything, anything at all.	14	1	7
206	 She told me about all the horses that she liked,	14	1	7
207	 the castle she wanted to live in and the man	14	1	7
208	 that she wanted to marry.	14	1	7
209	 A northerner with a jaw like an anvil.	14	1	7
210	 So I challenged him to a duel.	15	1	7
211	 I mean, why not? I'd read all the stories.	15	1	7
212	 The little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories.	15	1	7
213	 In the end, she wouldn't even let him kill me.	15	1	7
214	" ""He's just a boy,"" she said."	15	1	7
215	" ""Please don't hurt him."""	15	1	7
216	 So he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by	15	1	7
217	 - and off they went. - Is she still married to him?	15	1	7
218	 Oh no.	15	1	7
219	 He got himself killed before the wedding...	15	1	7
220	 ..And she ended up with his brother,	15	1	7
221	 an even more impressive specimen.	15	1	7
222	 She loves him, I'm afraid.	15	1	7
223	 And why wouldn't she? I mean, who could compare to him?	15	1	7
224	 He's just so...	15	1	7
225	 Good.	15	1	7
226	 Do you know what I learned, losing that duel?	15	1	7
227	 I learned that I'll never win,	15	1	7
228	 not that way. That's their game,	15	1	7
229	 their rules.	16	1	7
230	 I'm not going to fight them.	16	1	7
231	 I'm going to fuck them. That's what I know.	16	1	7
232	 That's what I am.	16	1	7
233	 And only by admitting what we are can we get what we want.	16	1	7
234	 And what do you want?	16	1	7
235	 Oh, everything, my dear.	16	1	7
236	 Everything there is.	16	1	7
237	 Now wash yourselves. Both of you are working tonight.	16	1	7
238	 Hmm.	16	1	7
239	 You're a very lucky girl. Do you know that?	17	1	7
240	 Where I come from, we don't show mercy to criminals.	17	1	7
241	 Where I come from, if someone like you attacked a little lord?	17	1	7
242	 At low tide we'd lay you on your back on the beach,	17	1	7
243	 your hands and feet chained to four stakes.	17	1	7
244	 The sea would come in closer and closer.	17	1	7
245	 You'd see death creeping toward you a few inches at a time.	17	1	7
246	 Where is it you come from?	17	1	7
247	 The Iron Islands.	17	1	7
248	 They far away?	17	1	7
249	 You've never heard of the Iron Islands?	17	1	7
250	 Trust me, you've never heard where I'm from neither.	17	1	7
251	" ""Trust me, My Lord."""	17	1	7
252	 You're not living in the wilderness anymore.	17	1	7
253	 In civilized lands, you refer to your betters	17	1	7
254	 by their proper titles.	17	1	7
255	 - And what's that? - Lord.	17	1	7
256	 Why?	18	1	7
257	 Why?	18	1	7
258	 What do you mean why?	18	1	7
259	 My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands.	18	1	7
260	 What's that got to do with you?	18	1	7
261	 If your father's lord,	18	1	7
262	 how can you be lord too?	18	1	7
263	 I will be lord after my father--	18	1	7
264	 so you're not lord now?	18	1	7
265	 No, you--	18	1	7
266	 You having a go at me? Is that it?	18	1	7
267	 I just don't understand how you Southerners do things.	18	1	7
268	 - I'm not a Southerner. - You're from South of the wall.	18	1	7
269	 That makes you a Southerner to me.	18	1	7
270	 You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?	18	1	7
271	 Couldn't say, My Lord.	18	1	7
272	" Don't know what ""impunent"" means."	18	1	7
273	 Impudent. It means rude,	18	1	7
274	 disrespectful.	18	1	7
275	 Do you want to lose that chain?	19	1	7
276	 Theon Greyjoy!	19	1	7
277	 The lady is our guest.	19	1	7
278	 I thought she was our prisoner.	19	1	7
279	 Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?	19	1	7
280	 Chances are I won't be nearby the next time that happens.	19	1	7
281	 I'm used to worse than him.	19	1	7
282	 I'm used to men who could chew that boy up	19	1	7
283	 and pick their teeth with his bones.	19	1	7
284	 Why did you come here?	19	1	7
285	 Didn't mean to come here.	19	1	7
286	 Meant to get much further South than this.	19	1	7
287	 As far South as South goes,	19	1	7
288	 before the long night comes.	19	1	7
289	 Why? What are you afraid of?	19	1	7
290	 There's things that sleep in the day	20	1	7
291	 - and hunt at night. - Owls and Shadowcats and--	20	1	7
292	 I'm not talking about Owls and Shadowcats.	20	1	7
293	" The ""things"" you speak of--"	20	1	7
294	 they've been gone for thousands of years.	20	1	7
295	 They wasn't gone, old man.	20	1	7
296	 They was sleeping.	20	1	7
297	 And they ain't sleeping no more.	20	1	7
298	 I miss girls.	20	1	7
299	 Not even talking to them. I never talked to them.	20	1	7
300	 Just looking at them,	20	1	7
301	 hearing them giggle.	20	1	7
302	 Don't you miss girls?	20	1	7
303	 Riders.	21	1	7
304	 The horn. We have to blow the horn.	21	1	7
305	 Why is he alone?	21	1	7
306	 One blast for a Ranger returning,	21	1	7
307	 two for Wildlings,	21	1	7
308	 - three for-- - there's no rider.	21	1	7
309	 Whoa, boy, whoa.	21	1	7
310	 That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.	21	1	7
311	 Where's my Uncle?	22	1	7
312	 Ned!	22	1	7
313	 It's Robert. We were hunting--	22	1	7
314	 a boar--	22	1	7
315	 I should have spent more time with you,	22	1	7
316	 shown you how to be a man.	22	1	7
317	 I was never meant to be a father.	22	1	7
318	 Go on.	22	1	7
319	 You don't want to see this.	23	1	7
320	 My fault.	23	1	7
321	 Too much wine, missed my thrust.	23	1	7
322	 It stinks.	23	1	7
323	 It stinks like death.	23	1	7
324	 Don't think I can't smell it.	23	1	7
325	 I paid the bastard back, Ned.	23	1	7
326	 I drove my knife right through his brain.	23	1	7
327	 You ask them if I didn't. Ask them!	23	1	7
328	 I want the funeral feast to be the biggest	23	1	7
329	 the Kingdoms ever saw.	23	1	7
330	 And I want everyone to taste the boar that got me.	24	1	7
331	 Now leave us, the lot of you. I need to talk to Ned.	24	1	7
332	 - Robert, my sweet-- - Out, all of you!	24	1	7
333	 You damned fool.	24	1	7
334	 Paper and ink on the table,	24	1	7
335	 write down what I say.	24	1	7
336	" ""In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon,"	24	1	7
337	" first of--"" you know how it goes."	24	1	7
338	 Fill in the damn titles.	24	1	7
339	" ""I hereby command"	25	1	7
340	" Eddard of House Stark--"""	25	1	7
341	 titles, titles--	25	1	7
342	" ""to serve as Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm"	25	1	7
343	 upon my death,	25	1	7
344	 to rule in my stead	25	1	7
345	" until my son Joffrey comes of age."""	25	1	7
346	 Give it over.	25	1	7
347	 Give it to the council	25	1	7
348	 after I'm dead.	26	1	7
349	 At least they'll say I did this right,	26	1	7
350	 this one thing.	26	1	7
351	 You'll rule now.	26	1	7
352	 You'll hate it worse than I did,	26	1	7
353	 but you'll do it well.	26	1	7
354	 The girl--	26	1	7
355	 Daenerys.	26	1	7
356	 You were right. Varys, Littlefinger,	26	1	7
357	 my brother... Worthless.	26	1	7
358	" No one to tell me ""no"" but you."	26	1	7
359	 Only you.	26	1	7
360	 Let her live.	26	1	7
361	 Stop it, if it's not too late.	26	1	7
362	 I will.	26	1	7
363	 And my son...	26	1	7
364	 Help him, Ned.	26	1	7
365	 Make him better than me.	26	1	7
366	 I'll...	27	1	7
367	 I'll do everything I can to honor your memory.	27	1	7
368	 My memory.	27	1	7
369	 King Robert Baratheon,	27	1	7
370	 murdered by a pig.	27	1	7
371	 Give me something for the pain and let me die.	27	1	7
372	 Give him milk of the poppy.	27	1	7
373	 He was reeling from the wine.	27	1	7
374	 He commanded us	27	1	7
375	 to step aside, but...	27	1	7
376	 I failed him.	28	1	7
377	 No man could have protected him from himself.	28	1	7
378	 I wonder, Ser Barristan,	28	1	7
379	 who gave the king this wine?	28	1	7
380	 His squire, from the king's own skin.	28	1	7
381	 His squire? The Lannister boy?	28	1	7
382	 Such a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace	28	1	7
383	 did not lack refreshment.	28	1	7
384	 I do hope the poor lad does not blame himself.	28	1	7
385	 His Grace has had a change of heart	28	1	7
386	 concerning Daenerys Targaryen.	28	1	7
387	 Whatever arrangements you made,	28	1	7
388	 unmake them. At once.	28	1	7
389	 I'm afraid	28	1	7
390	 those birds have flown.	28	1	7
391	 The girl is likely dead already.	28	1	7
392	 ...Throne.	29	1	7
393	 Throne.	29	1	7
394	 Can't you help me make him understand?	30	1	7
395	 The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons.	30	1	7
396	 Have patience, Khaleesi. We will go home, I promise you.	30	1	7
397	 My brother was a fool, I know,	30	1	7
398	 but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms.	30	1	7
399	 Have I said something funny, Ser?	30	1	7
400	 Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror	31	1	7
401	 didn't seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right.	31	1	7
402	 He had no right to them. He seized them because he could.	31	1	7
403	 And because he had dragons.	31	1	7
404	 Ah well, having a few dragons makes things easier.	31	1	7
405	 - You don't believe it. - Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi?	31	1	7
406	 I believe what my eyes and ears report.	31	1	7
407	 As for the rest... It was 300 years ago.	31	1	7
408	 Who knows what really happened?	31	1	7
409	 Now if you'll pardon me, I'll seek out the merchant Captain,	31	1	7
410	 see if he has any letters for me.	31	1	7
411	 - I'll come with you. - No no, don't trouble yourself.	31	1	7
412	 Enjoy the market. I'll rejoin you soon enough.	31	1	7
413	 Psst, Jorah the Andal.	31	1	7
414	 The spider sends his greetings	31	1	7
415	 and his congratulations.	31	1	7
416	 A royal pardon-- you can go home now.	31	1	7
417	 Virzetha gizikhven! Mra qora! Mra qora!	32	1	7
418	 My son already has his name, but I'll try your summerwine.	32	1	7
419	 Just a taste.	32	1	7
420	 My Lady, you are from Westeros.	32	1	7
421	 You have the honor of addressing Daenerys of the House Targaryen,	32	1	7
422	 Khaleesi of the riding men and princess of the Seven Kingdoms.	32	1	7
423	 - Princess. - Rise.	32	1	7
424	 I'd still like to taste that wine.	33	1	7
425	 That? Dornish swill.	33	1	7
426	 Not worthy of a princess.	33	1	7
427	 I have a dry red from the Arbor--	33	1	7
428	 nectar of the Gods.	33	1	7
429	 Let me give you a cask. Uh-- a gift.	33	1	7
430	 You honor me, Ser.	33	1	7
431	 The honor-- the honor is all mine.	33	1	7
432	 Huh-uh, huh-uh.	33	1	7
433	 There are many in your homeland that pray for your return, princess.	33	1	7
434	 I hope to repay your kindness someday.	33	1	7
435	 - Rakharo. - Huh.	33	1	7
436	 - Is something wrong? - I have a thirst.	33	1	7
437	 Open it.	33	1	7
438	 The wine is for the Khaleesi. It's not for the likes of you.	33	1	7
439	 Open it.	33	1	7
440	 Pour.	33	1	7
441	 It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich	33	1	7
442	 without at least giving it time to breathe.	34	1	7
443	 Do as he says.	34	1	7
444	 As the princess commands.	34	1	7
445	 Sweet, isn't it?	34	1	7
446	 Can you smell the fruit, Ser?	34	1	7
447	 Taste it, My Lord.	34	1	7
448	 Tell me that that is not the finest wine	34	1	7
449	 that has ever touched your tongue.	34	1	7
450	 You first.	34	1	7
451	 Me?	34	1	7
452	 I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.	34	1	7
453	 Besides, it is a poor wine merchant who would	34	1	7
454	 drink up his own wares.	34	1	7
455	 You will drink.	34	1	7
456	 - Khaleesi! - Stop him!	35	1	7
457	 Come.	35	1	7
458	 You came to us as outlaws,	35	1	7
459	 poachers, rapers,	35	1	7
460	 killers, thieves.	35	1	7
461	 You came alone, in chains,	35	1	7
462	 without friends	35	1	7
463	 nor honor.	35	1	7
464	 You came to us rich and you came to us poor.	35	1	7
465	 Some of you bear the names of proud houses,	35	1	7
466	 others only bastard names or no names at all.	35	1	7
467	 It does not matter.	36	1	7
468	 All that is in the past.	36	1	7
469	 Here,	36	1	7
470	 on the wall,	36	1	7
471	 are all one house.	36	1	7
472	 - Tonight... - You're allowed to look happy.	36	1	7
473	 You're going to be a Ranger.	36	1	7
474	 Isn't that what you always wanted?	36	1	7
475	 I want to find my Uncle.	36	1	7
476	 I know he's alive out there.	36	1	7
477	 I know he is.	36	1	7
478	 I wish I could help you, but I'm no Ranger.	36	1	7
479	 It's the steward's life for me.	36	1	7
480	 There's honor in being a steward.	36	1	7
481	 Not much, really.	36	1	7
482	 But there's food.	36	1	7
483	 Here you begin anew.	36	1	7
484	 A man of The Night's Watch...	37	1	7
485	 Lives his life for the realm.	37	1	7
486	 Not for a king,	37	1	7
487	 or a lord, or the honor of this house	37	1	7
488	 or that house;	37	1	7
489	 not for gold nor glory	37	1	7
490	 nor a woman's love;	37	1	7
491	 but for the realm	37	1	7
492	 and all the people in it.	37	1	7
493	 You've all learned the words of the vow.	37	1	7
494	 Think carefully before you say them.	37	1	7
495	 The penalty for desertion	37	1	7
496	 is death.	37	1	7
497	 You can take your vows here	37	1	7
498	 tonight at sunset.	37	1	7
499	 Do any of you still keep the old Gods?	37	1	7
500	 I do, My Lord.	37	1	7
501	 You'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your Uncle did.	38	1	7
502	 Yes, My Lord.	38	1	7
503	 You'll find a Weirwood a mile North of the Wall.	38	1	7
504	 And your old Gods too, maybe.	38	1	7
505	 My Lord, might I go as well?	38	1	7
506	 Does house Tarly keep the old Gods?	38	1	7
507	 No, My Lord.	38	1	7
508	 I was named in the light of the Seven,	38	1	7
509	 as my father was and his father before him.	38	1	7
510	 Why would you forsake the Gods of your father and your house?	38	1	7
511	 The Night's Watch is my house now.	38	1	7
512	 The Seven have never answered my prayers.	38	1	7
513	 Perhaps the old Gods will.	38	1	7
514	 As you wish, lad.	38	1	7
515	 You've all been assigned an order,	38	1	7
516	 according to our needs	38	1	7
517	 and your strengths.	38	1	7
518	 Halder to the builders.	38	1	7
519	 Pyp to the stewards.	38	1	7
520	 Toad to the builders. Grenn to the Rangers.	38	1	7
521	 Samwell to the stewards.	39	1	7
522	 Matthar to the Rangers. Dareon to the stewards.	39	1	7
523	 Balian to the Rangers.	39	1	7
524	 Rast to the Rangers.	39	1	7
525	 Jon to the stewards.	39	1	7
526	 Rancer to the builders.	39	1	7
527	 Echiel to the builders.	39	1	7
528	 Gordo to the stewards.	39	1	7
529	 Niko to the Rangers. Escan to the Rangers.	39	1	7
530	 Vorkoy to the builders. Joby to the stables.	39	1	7
531	 Mink to the kitchens. Allo to the builders.	39	1	7
532	 Nelugo to the Rangers.	39	1	7
533	 May all the Gods preserve you.	39	1	7
534	 Rangers with me.	39	1	7
535	 Builders!	39	1	7
536	 Samwell, you will assist me in the rookery and library.	40	1	7
537	 Pyp, you will report to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens.	40	1	7
538	 Luke, report to one-eyed Joe in the stables.	40	1	7
539	 Dareon, we are sending you to Eastwatch.	40	1	7
540	 Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive.	40	1	7
541	 Make no comment about his nose.	40	1	7
542	 Jon Snow, Lord Commander Mormont	40	1	7
543	 has requested you for his personal steward.	40	1	7
544	 Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals	40	1	7
545	 and fetch hot water for his bath.	40	1	7
546	 Certainly.	40	1	7
547	 And keep a fire burning in his chambers,	40	1	7
548	 change his sheets and blankets daily	40	1	7
549	 and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you.	40	1	7
550	 Do you take me for a servant?	40	1	7
551	 We took you for a man of The Night's Watch.	40	1	7
552	 But perhaps we were wrong in that.	40	1	7
553	 - May I go? - As you wish.	41	1	7
554	 Jon, wait!	41	1	7
555	 Don't you see what they're doing?	41	1	7
556	 I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all.	41	1	7
557	 He wanted it and he got it.	41	1	7
558	 Stewards are nothing but maids!	41	1	7
559	 I'm a better swordsman and rider than any of you!	41	1	7
560	 - It's not fair. - Fair?	41	1	7
561	 I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall	41	1	7
562	 when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock.	41	1	7
563	 I pushed him away and he said he'd have my hands cut off	41	1	7
564	 for stealing their silver.	41	1	7
565	 So now I'm here-- at the end of the world	41	1	7
566	 with no one to sing for	41	1	7
567	 but old men and little shits like you.	41	1	7
568	 I'll never see my family again.	41	1	7
569	 I'll never be inside a woman again.	41	1	7
570	 So don't tell me about fair.	41	1	7
571	 I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese	41	1	7
572	 for your starving sister?	41	1	7
573	 You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers	41	1	7
574	 that a high lord tried to grab my cock?	41	1	7
575	 Could you sing me a song, Pyp? I'd like to hear a song.	42	1	7
576	 Now listen to me.	42	1	7
577	 The old man is the Lord Commander of The Night's Watch.	42	1	7
578	 You'll be with him day and night.	42	1	7
579	 Yes, you'll clean his clothes.	42	1	7
580	 But you'll also take his letters, attend him at meetings,	42	1	7
581	 squire for him in battle.	42	1	7
582	 You'll know everything, be part of everything.	42	1	7
583	 And he asked for you himself.	42	1	7
584	 He wants to groom you for command.	42	1	7
585	 I just...	42	1	7
586	 I always wanted to be a Ranger.	42	1	7
587	 I always wanted to be a Wizard.	42	1	7
588	 What?	42	1	7
589	 No, I'm serious.	42	1	7
590	 So you'll stay and say your words with me?	42	1	7
591	 Lord Stark, a moment.	43	1	7
592	 Alone if you will.	43	1	7
593	 He named you Protector of the Realm.	43	1	7
594	 He did.	43	1	7
595	 She won't care.	43	1	7
596	 Give me an hour and I can put a hundred swords at your command.	43	1	7
597	 And what should I do with a hundred swords?	43	1	7
598	 Strike! Tonight while the castle sleeps.	43	1	7
599	 We must get Joffrey away fro his mother and into our custody.	43	1	7
600	 Protector of the Realm or no, he who holds the King holds the Kingdom.	43	1	7
601	 Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare.	43	1	7
602	 By the time Robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us.	43	1	7
603	 What about Stannis?	43	1	7
604	 Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?	43	1	7
605	 You have odd notions about protecting the realm.	44	1	7
606	 Stannis is your older brother.	44	1	7
607	 This isn't about the bloody line of succession.	44	1	7
608	 That didn't matter when you rebelled against the Mad King.	44	1	7
609	 It shouldn't matter now.	44	1	7
610	 What's best for the Kingdoms?	44	1	7
611	 What's best for the people we rule?	44	1	7
612	 We all know what Stannis is.	44	1	7
613	 He inspires no love or loyalty.	44	1	7
614	 He's not a King.	44	1	7
615	 I am.	44	1	7
616	 Stannis is a commander.	44	1	7
617	 He's led men into war twice.	44	1	7
618	 He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet--	44	1	7
619	 Yes, he's a good soldier. Everyone knows that.	44	1	7
620	 So was Robert.	44	1	7
621	 Tell me something:	44	1	7
622	 Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?	44	1	7
623	 I will not dishonor Robert's last hours	44	1	7
624	 by shedding blood in his halls	45	1	7
625	 and dragging frightened children from their beds.	45	1	7
626	 You will sail to dragonstone tonight.	45	1	7
627	 You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon.	45	1	7
628	 Not his steward,	45	1	7
629	 not his Captain of the guard,	45	1	7
630	 and not his wife.	45	1	7
631	 Only Stannis himself.	45	1	7
632	 Yes, My Lord.	45	1	7
633	 Now leave us.	45	1	7
634	 My Lord protector.	45	1	7
635	 The King has no trueborn sons.	46	1	7
636	 Joffrey and Tommen	46	1	7
637	 are Jaime Lannister's bastards.	46	1	7
638	 - So when the King dies-- - The throne passes	46	1	7
639	 to his brother Lord Stannis.	46	1	7
640	 So it would seem.	46	1	7
641	" - Unless-- - there is no ""unless."""	46	1	7
642	 He is the rightful heir. Nothing can change that.	46	1	7
643	 And he cannot take the throne without your help.	46	1	7
644	 You would be wise to deny it to him	46	1	7
645	 and to make sure Joffrey succeeds.	46	1	7
646	 Do you have a shred of honor?	46	1	7
647	 You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm.	46	1	7
648	 All of the power is yours. You need only	46	1	7
649	 reach out and take it.	46	1	7
650	 Make peace with the Lannisters.	46	1	7
651	 Release the Imp. Wed your daughter to Joffrey.	46	1	7
652	 We have plenty of time to get rid of Stannis.	46	1	7
653	 And if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he	47	1	7
654	 comes into his throne,	47	1	7
655	 we simply reveal his little secret	47	1	7
656	 and seat Lord Renly there instead.	47	1	7
657	 We?	47	1	7
658	 You'll need someone to share these burdens.	47	1	7
659	 I assure you-- my price would be modest.	47	1	7
660	 What you suggest is treason.	47	1	7
661	 Only if we lose.	47	1	7
662	 Make peace with the Lannisters, you say...	47	1	7
663	 With the people who tried to murder my boy.	47	1	7
664	 We only make peace with our enemies, My Lord.	47	1	7
665	" That's why it's called ""making peace."""	47	1	7
666	 No. I won't do it.	47	1	7
667	 So it will be Stannis and war?	47	1	7
668	 There is no other choice.	47	1	7
669	 He is the heir.	47	1	7
670	 So why did you call me here?	47	1	7
671	 Not for my wisdom, clearly.	47	1	7
672	 You promised Catelyn you would help me.	47	1	7
673	 The Queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms--	47	1	7
674	 enough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard.	48	1	7
675	 I need the gold cloaks.	48	1	7
676	 The City Watch is 2,000 strong	48	1	7
677	 and sworn to defend the King's peace.	48	1	7
678	 Look at you.	48	1	7
679	 You know what you want me to do,	48	1	7
680	 you know it has to be done,	48	1	7
681	 but it's not honorable so the words stick in your throat.	48	1	7
682	 When the Queen proclaims one King	48	1	7
683	 and the Hand proclaims another,	48	1	7
684	 whose peace do the Gold Cloaks protect?	48	1	7
685	 Who do they follow?	48	1	7
686	 The man who pays them.	48	1	7
687	 Hear my words and bear witness to my vow.	49	1	7
688	 Night gathers and now my watch begins.	49	1	7
689	 It shall not end until my death.	49	1	7
690	 I shall take no wife,	49	1	7
691	 hold no lands, father no children.	49	1	7
692	 I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.	49	1	7
693	 I shall live and die at my post.	49	1	7
694	 I am the sword in the darkness.	50	1	7
695	 I am the watcher on the walls.	50	1	7
696	 I am the shield that guards the realms of men.	50	1	7
697	 I pledge my li and honor to The Night's Watch,	50	1	7
698	 for this night and all the nights to come.	50	1	7
699	 You knelt as boys.	50	1	7
700	 Rise now as men of The Night's Watch.	50	1	7
701	 Well done. Well done.	50	1	7
702	 What's he got there?	50	1	7
703	 To me, ghost. Bring it here.	50	1	7
704	 Gods be good!	50	1	7
705	 What will they do to him?	51	1	7
706	 When the Khalasar rides, he'll be leashed to a saddle,	51	1	7
707	 forced to run behind the horses for as long as he can.	51	1	7
708	 And when he falls?	51	1	7
709	 I saw a man last nine miles once.	51	1	7
710	 King Robert still wants me dead.	51	1	7
711	 This poisoner was the first. He won't be the last.	51	1	7
712	 I thought he'd leave me alone--	51	1	7
713	 now that my brother is gone.	51	1	7
714	 He will never leave you alone.	51	1	7
715	 If you ride to darkest Asshai, his assassins will follow you.	51	1	7
716	 If you sailed all the way to the Basilisk Isles,	51	1	7
717	 his spies would tell him.	51	1	7
718	 He will never abandon the hunt.	51	1	7
719	 You're a Targaryen-- the last Targaryen.	51	1	7
720	 Your son will have Targaryen blood	51	1	7
721	 with 40,000 riders behind him.	51	1	7
722	 He will not have my son.	51	1	7
723	 He will not have you either, Khaleesi.	51	1	7
724	 Lord Stark!	55	1	7
725	 - Stop! -  No, all right.	55	1	7
726	 It's all right. Let him through.	55	1	7
727	 Lord Stark, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent	55	1	7
728	 request your presence in the Throne Room.	55	1	7
729	 King Joffrey?	55	1	7
730	 King Robert is gone.	55	1	7
731	 The Gods give him rest.	55	1	7
732	 All is accomplished. The City Watch is yours.	55	1	7
733	 Good.	55	1	7
734	 Is Lord Renly joining us?	55	1	7
735	 I fear Lord Renly has left the city.	55	1	7
736	 He rode through the old gate	55	1	7
737	 an hour before dawn	55	1	7
738	 with Ser Loras Tyrell and some 50 retainers.	55	1	7
739	 Last seen galloping South in some haste.	55	1	7
740	 We stand behind you, Lord Stark.	56	1	7
741	 All hail his Grace,	56	1	7
742	 Joffrey of Houses Baratheon and Lannister,	56	1	7
743	 the first of his name,	56	1	7
744	 King of the Andals and the First Men,	56	1	7
745	 Lord of the Seven Kingdoms	56	1	7
746	 and Protector of the Realm.	56	1	7
747	 I command the council to make all necessary arrangements	57	1	7
748	 for my coronation.	57	1	7
749	 I wish to be crowned within the fortnight.	57	1	7
750	 Today I shall accept oaths of fealty	57	1	7
751	 from my loyal councilors.	57	1	7
752	 Ser Barristan,	57	1	7
753	 I believe no man here could ever question your honor.	57	1	7
754	 King Robert's seal-- unbroken.	57	1	7
755	" ""Lord Eddard Stark is herein named"	57	1	7
756	 Protector of the Realm,	57	1	7
757	 to rule as Regent	57	1	7
758	" until the heir come of age."""	58	1	7
759	 May I see that letter, Ser Barristan?	58	1	7
760	 Protector of the realm.	58	1	7
761	 Is this meant to be your shield, Lord Stark?	58	1	7
762	 A piece of paper?	58	1	7
763	 - Those were the King's words. - We have a new King now.	58	1	7
764	 Lord Eddard, when we last spoke you offered me some counsel.	58	1	7
765	 Allow me to return the courtesy.	58	1	7
766	 Bend the knee, My Lord.	58	1	7
767	 Bend the knee and swear loyalty to my son--	58	1	7
768	 and we shall allow you to live out your days	58	1	7
769	 in the gray waste you call home.	58	1	7
770	 Your son has no claim to the throne.	58	1	7
771	 Liar!	58	1	7
772	 You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark.	59	1	7
773	 Ser Barristan, seize this traitor.	59	1	7
774	 Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man. Do him no harm.	59	1	7
775	 You think he stands alone?	59	1	7
776	 Kill him! Kill all of them, I command it!	59	1	7
777	 Commander,	59	1	7
778	 take the Queen and her children into custody.	59	1	7
779	 Escort them back to the royal apartments	59	1	7
780	 and keep them there, under guard.	59	1	7
781	 Men of the Watch!	59	1	7
782	 I want no bloodshed.	59	1	7
783	 Tell your men to lay down their swords.	59	1	7
784	 No one needs to die.	59	1	7
785	 Now!	59	1	7
786	 I did warn you not to trust me.	59	1	7
0		0	6	4
1	 Where you gonna go?	2	6	4
2	 South.	2	6	4
3	 What are you gonna do?	2	6	4
4	 Get warm.	2	6	4
5	 I was with you at Hardhome.	2	6	4
6	 We saw what's out there.	2	6	4
7	 We know it's coming here.	2	6	4
8	 How can you leave us now?	2	6	4
9	 I did everything I could. You know that.	2	6	4
10	 - You swore a vow. - Aye, I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.	2	6	4
11	 - I gave my life. - For all nights to come.	2	6	4
12	 They killed me, Edd! My own brothers.	2	6	4
13	 You want me to stay here after that?	2	6	4
14	 Riders approaching!	2	6	4
15	 Open the gate!	3	6	4
16	 This is good soup.	4	6	4
17	 Do you remember those kidney pies Old Nan used to make?	4	6	4
18	 With the peas and onions?	4	6	4
19	 We never should have left Winterfell.	4	6	4
20	 Don't you wish we could go back to the day we left?	4	6	4
21	" I want to scream at myself, ""Don't go, you idiot."""	5	6	4
22	 How could we know?	5	6	4
23	 I spent a lot of time thinking about what an ass I was to you.	5	6	4
24	 I wish I could change everything.	5	6	4
25	 We were children.	5	6	4
26	 I was awful, just admit it.	5	6	4
27	 You were occasionally awful.	5	6	4
28	 I'm sure I can't have been great fun.	5	6	4
29	 Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played.	5	6	4
30	 - Can you forgive me? - There's nothing to forgive.	5	6	4
31	 - Forgive me. - All right.	5	6	4
32	 All right, I forgive you.	5	6	4
33	 You'd think after thousands of years,	5	6	4
34	 the Night's Watch would have learned how to make a good ale.	5	6	4
35	 Where will you go?	5	6	4
36	 Where will we go?	6	6	4
37	 If I don't watch over you, Father's ghost will come back and murder me.	6	6	4
38	 Where will we go?	6	6	4
39	 I can't stay here, not after what happened.	6	6	4
40	 There's only one place we can go.	6	6	4
41	 Home.	6	6	4
42	 Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave?	6	6	4
43	 We'll take it back from them.	6	6	4
44	 I don't have an army.	6	6	4
45	 How many wildlings did you save?	6	6	4
46	 They didn't come here to serve me.	6	6	4
47	 They owe you their lives.	6	6	4
48	 You think they'll be safe here if Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?	6	6	4
49	 - Sansa. - Winterfell is our home.	6	6	4
50	 It's ours and Arya's and Bran's and Rickon's.	6	6	4
51	 Wherever they are, it belongs to our family.	6	6	4
52	 We have to fight for it.	6	6	4
53	 I'm tired of fighting.	6	6	4
54	 It's all I've done since I left home.	6	6	4
55	 I've killed brothers of the Night's Watch.	6	6	4
56	 I've killed wildlings. I've killed men that I admire.	6	6	4
57	 I hanged a boy younger than Bran.	7	6	4
58	 I fought and I lost.	7	6	4
59	 If we don't take back the North, we'll never be safe.	7	6	4
60	 I want you to help me.	7	6	4
61	 But I'll do it myself if I have to.	7	6	4
62	 My lady.	7	6	4
63	 Ser Davos.	7	6	4
64	 Will you stay here at Castle Black?	7	6	4
65	 I will do as Jon Snow commands.	7	6	4
66	 You serve Jon Snow now?	7	6	4
67	 He's the prince that was promised.	7	6	4
68	 Forgive me, my lady, I thought that was Stannis.	7	6	4
69	 What happened down there?	8	6	4
70	 There was a battle. Stannis was defeated.	8	6	4
71	 And Shireen?	8	6	4
72	 What happened to the princess?	8	6	4
73	 I saw what happened.	8	6	4
74	 I saw Stannis' forces defeated in the field.	8	6	4
75	 My lady, I'm Ser Davos Seaworth.	8	6	4
76	 We've met before.	8	6	4
77	 I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.	8	6	4
78	 Before Renly was assassinated with bloodmagic.	8	6	4
79	 That's in the past now.	8	6	4
80	 Yes, it's in the past.	8	6	4
81	 It doesn't mean I forget.	8	6	4
82	 Or forgive.	8	6	4
83	 He admitted it, you know.	8	6	4
84	 Who did?	8	6	4
85	 Stannis.	8	6	4
86	 Just before I executed him.	8	6	4
87	 The Defender of the Vale!	9	6	4
88	 Uncle Petyr!	9	6	4
89	 My lord.	9	6	4
90	 Come and see.	9	6	4
91	 I missed your name day. Go on.	9	6	4
92	 A falcon!	10	6	4
93	 A gyrfalcon.	10	6	4
94	 The greatest and rarest of birds.	10	6	4
95	 Last time I saw you, Baelish,	10	6	4
96	 you told me you were taking Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers.	10	6	4
97	 Indeed I was.	10	6	4
98	 And yet not long ago, we received reports	10	6	4
99	 that she has been married to Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell.	10	6	4
100	 On our way to the Fingers, we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men.	10	6	4
101	 Seemed to know exactly when we were traveling	10	6	4
102	 and exactly whom we were transporting.	10	6	4
103	 Do you take me for a fool?	10	6	4
104	 Tell me, Lord Royce,	10	6	4
105	 how many people knew of my travel plans with Sansa Stark?	10	6	4
106	 I shared my intentions with you	10	6	4
107	 and no one else.	10	6	4
108	 Slander a man in his own home,	10	6	4
109	 you might find yourself crossing swords with him.	10	6	4
110	 Your home is the Vale. The Lord of the Vale stands before us.	10	6	4
111	 And only his judgment concerns me.	10	6	4
112	 Shall we throw him through the Moon Door?	11	6	4
113	 My lord.	11	6	4
114	 My lord, I have always been faithful to House Arryn.	11	6	4
115	 To your father, to your mother, and now to you.	11	6	4
116	 Do you believe him, Uncle Petyr?	11	6	4
117	 Lord Royce has served the Vale well.	11	6	4
118	 He's enjoyed a distinguished military career.	11	6	4
119	 If we could trust his absolute loyalty,	11	6	4
120	 he would make a capable commander in the wars to come.	11	6	4
121	 You can trust my absolute loyalty, my lord.	11	6	4
122	 I think he deserves one more chance. What do you say?	11	6	4
123	 Fine.	12	6	4
124	 I bring good news.	12	6	4
125	 My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell.	12	6	4
126	 I expect she's headed to Castle Black	12	6	4
127	 where her brother serves as Lord Commander.	12	6	4
128	 But she won't be safe there, not with the Boltons after her.	12	6	4
129	 She's my cousin.	12	6	4
130	 We should help her.	12	6	4
131	 That was my instinct as well.	12	6	4
132	 Our lord has spoken.	12	6	4
133	 Gather the Knights of the Vale.	12	6	4
134	 The time has come to join the fray.	12	6	4
135	 You invite the enemy into our city?	12	6	4
136	 I did.	12	6	4
137	 As a clever man once told me,	12	6	4
138	" ""We make peace with our enemies, not our friends."""	12	6	4
139	 I don't make peace with the queen's enemies.	13	6	4
140	 I kill the queen's enemies.	13	6	4
141	 Yes, that's the military approach.	13	6	4
142	 And how has that worked here in Meereen?	13	6	4
143	 I represent the diplomatic approach.	13	6	4
144	 Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters	13	6	4
145	 and they tried to murder her.	13	6	4
146	 We enter these negotiations with open eyes.	13	6	4
147	 Trust me. My own recent experience with slavery	13	6	4
148	 has taught me the horrors of that institution.	13	6	4
149	 How many days were you a slave?	13	6	4
150	 Long enough to know.	13	6	4
151	 Not long enough to understand.	13	6	4
152	 I bought this dwarf for a single gold honor.	13	6	4
153	 And somehow you've risen	13	6	4
154	 to the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen.	13	6	4
155	 It's most impressive.	13	6	4
156	 And now you speak for the Good Masters of Astapor.	13	6	4
157	 Here's to reversals of fortune.	13	6	4
158	 We came here to meet the queen	13	6	4
159	 and instead we're greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch.	13	6	4
160	 Let's make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want.	13	6	4
161	 We want you to leave Slaver's Bay.	14	6	4
162	 Take your dragons and your mercenaries and go.	14	6	4
163	 Queen Daenerys won't stay in Meereen forever.	14	6	4
164	 Her path takes her westward.	14	6	4
165	 When we last met, I offered her ships	14	6	4
166	 so she could return to Westeros where she belongs. She refused them.	14	6	4
167	 She refused them because hundreds of thousands	14	6	4
168	 of men, women, and children still lived in chains.	14	6	4
169	 As they have since the dawn of time.	14	6	4
170	 - Not anymore. - You think you're a free man now?	14	6	4
171	 You still follow orders.	14	6	4
172	 Just because your master has silver hair and tits	14	6	4
173	 doesn't mean she's not a master.	14	6	4
174	 Friends, friends, friends, please.	14	6	4
175	 There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing.	14	6	4
176	 That is the way of the world. I'm not here to change the way of the world.	14	6	4
177	 Slavery is the way of our world.	14	6	4
178	 You don't need slaves to make money.	14	6	4
179	 There haven't been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years	14	6	4
180	 and I grew up richer than any of you.	14	6	4
181	 But our queen recognizes that she erred	15	6	4
182	 by abolishing slavery	15	6	4
183	 without providing a new system to replace it.	15	6	4
184	 So here is the queen's proposal.	15	6	4
185	 Slavery will never return to Meereen,	15	6	4
186	 but she will give the other cities of Slaver's Bay	15	6	4
187	 time to adjust to the new order.	15	6	4
188	 What does that mean?	15	6	4
189	 Instead of abolishing slavery overnight,	15	6	4
190	 we will give you seven years to end the practice.	15	6	4
191	 Slaveholders will be compensated	15	6	4
192	 for their losses, of course, at fair prices.	15	6	4
193	 In exchange, you will cut off	15	6	4
194	 your support for the Sons of the Harpy.	15	6	4
195	 We do not support the Sons of the Harpy.	15	6	4
196	 Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same.	15	6	4
197	 I do hope you accept, my friends.	15	6	4
198	 You will not receive a better offer.	15	6	4
199	 Let us sail on the tide of freedom	16	6	4
200	 instead of being drowned by it.	16	6	4
201	 And as a parting gift to our honored guests...	16	6	4
202	 Give freedom a chance.	16	6	4
203	 See if it doesn't taste every bit as good as what came before.	16	6	4
204	 _	16	6	4
205	 _	16	6	4
206	 _	16	6	4
207	 Perhaps I should translate for you.	16	6	4
208	 We speak the Common Tongue.	16	6	4
209	 - Excellent. - You met with the slavers today.	16	6	4
210	 I did.	16	6	4
211	 Our brothers and sisters died fighting this scum.	16	6	4
212	 Now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them.	16	6	4
213	 I imagine this room was built	17	6	4
214	 so the rulers could intimidate the ruled.	17	6	4
215	 But I am not your ruler.	17	6	4
216	 I'm not the Breaker of Chains.	17	6	4
217	 I'm not the Unburnt.	17	6	4
218	 And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons.	17	6	4
219	 You are a stranger here.	17	6	4
220	 So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies?	17	6	4
221	 Because our queen chose me as her advisor.	17	6	4
222	 Until she returns from her travels...	17	6	4
223	 When does she return?	17	6	4
224	 Soon. You have my word.	17	6	4
225	 We don't know you. We don't trust you. We know Torgo Nudho.	17	6	4
226	 We fight with him against the Masters. We trust him.	17	6	4
227	 And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations.	17	6	4
228	 As commander of the Unsullied, he knows how to defeat the slavers	17	6	4
229	 and he knows when it is time to make peace.	17	6	4
230	 You have made peace with the slavers?	17	6	4
231	 We offered terms.	17	6	4

244	 - Do not use me for your lies. - Those men respect you.	18	6	4
245	 They respect me because they know who I am.	18	6	4
246	 - They know I am loyal. - As do I.	18	6	4
247	 I am loyal to my queen, not you.	19	6	4
248	 If you betray her work, you are my enemy.	19	6	4
249	 I am not betraying her work. I am trying to save her city.	19	6	4
250	 You promised the slavers they could keep slavery.	19	6	4
251	 For a short time.	19	6	4
252	 Seven years is not a short time for a slave.	19	6	4
253	 You're right.	19	6	4
254	 Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once.	19	6	4
255	 War is a horror that should be ended at once.	19	6	4
256	 I can't do both today.	19	6	4
257	 You are wrong to trust these men.	19	6	4
258	 I don't trust the Masters. I trust their self-interest.	19	6	4
259	 They're trustworthy if they're convinced	19	6	4
260	 that working with me is in their self-interest.	19	6	4
261	 You don't know them. You don't understand them.	19	6	4
262	 We are not human in their eyes.	19	6	4
263	 They look at me and see a weapon.	19	6	4
264	 They look at her and see a whore.	19	6	4
265	 They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast.	19	6	4
266	 Their contempt is their weakness.	19	6	4
267	 They'll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage.	19	6	4
268	 You will not use them.	19	6	4
269	 They will use you. That is what they do.	19	6	4
270	 You all right?	20	6	4
271	 Why don't you sit and catch your breath?	20	6	4
272	 I'm fine.	20	6	4
273	 I don't think you could ride the dragon.	20	6	4
274	 20 years ago, maybe.	20	6	4
275	 - What? - Our queen.	20	6	4
276	 She's wild, you know. Don't let her size fool you.	20	6	4
277	 It's hard enough for me and I'm a young man.	20	6	4
278	 You, I don't think your heart could take it.	20	6	4
279	 Must make you angry that our queen chose me.	20	6	4
280	 Makes me sad. You'll disappoint her before long.	20	6	4
281	 - She'll move on. - We'll all disappoint her before long.	20	6	4
282	 We need each other right now. After we're done needing each other...	20	6	4
283	 Oh, I don't want to fight you, Jorah the Andal.	20	6	4
284	 What do I have to gain?	21	6	4
285	 If I win, I'm the shit who killed an old man.	21	6	4
286	 If I lose, I'm the shit who was killed by an old man.	21	6	4
287	 You didn't get much discipline as a child, did you?	21	6	4
288	 None.	21	6	4
289	 The road running through the Horse Gate,	21	6	4
290	 they call that the godsway.	21	6	4
291	 Eastern Market, Western Market.	21	6	4
292	 When Khal Drogo died, she was supposed to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen,	21	6	4
293	 the widows of the dead khals.	21	6	4
294	 That's where they would have taken her,	21	6	4
295	 the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen.	21	6	4
296	 What are you doing?	21	6	4
297	 It's forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.	21	6	4
298	 Isn't it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi?	21	6	4
299	 If they spot us and we're unarmed,	22	6	4
300	 we'll say we're traders heading for the Western Market.	22	6	4
301	 But if they see weapons...	22	6	4
302	 You're asking a dog to hand over his teeth.	22	6	4
303	 There's 100,000 of them down there.	22	6	4
304	 We can't fight our way out.	22	6	4
305	 We wait till dark, and then we'll find her.	22	6	4
306	 I'm very attached to this knife.	22	6	4
307	 Don't worry. It didn't touch you.	22	6	4
308	 You know what happens?	22	6	4
309	 I know what happens.	22	6	4
310	 I'll do it myself.	22	6	4
311	 I should have been born a Dothraki.	23	6	4

359	 We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive.	27	6	4
360	 All we can do is try.	27	6	4
361	 No.	27	6	4

364	 _	28	6	4

366	 _	28	6	4
367	 If I were to let you leave right now, where would you go?	29	6	4
368	 What would you seek out?	29	6	4
369	 I'd go to my brother,	29	6	4
370	 my husband, my family.	29	6	4
371	 Of course, but for you, that means seeking out money,	29	6	4
372	 finery, power.	29	6	4
373	 Seeking out your family means seeking out sin.	29	6	4
374	 I'm not maligning you.	29	6	4
375	 I sought those things out, too.	29	6	4
376	 To the exclusion of all else.	29	6	4
377	 My father was a cobbler.	29	6	4
378	 He died when I was young and I took over his shop.	29	6	4
379	 He was a simple man and he made simple shoes.	29	6	4
380	 But I found that the more work I put into my shoes,	29	6	4
381	 the more people wanted them.	29	6	4
382	 Fine leather, ornamentation,	29	6	4
383	 detailing, and time.	30	6	4
384	 Time most of all.	30	6	4
385	 Dozens of hours spent on a single pair.	30	6	4
386	 Quality takes time.	30	6	4
387	 Yes.	30	6	4
388	 I imagine you've worn a year	30	6	4
389	 of someone's life on your back.	30	6	4
390	 The highborn liked to cover their feet with my time	30	6	4
391	 and they paid well for the privilege.	30	6	4
392	 I used their money	30	6	4
393	 to buy a taste of their lives for myself.	30	6	4
394	 Each time I indulged,	30	6	4
395	 I felt myself ascending to something better.	30	6	4
396	 And one day you walked through a graveyard	30	6	4
397	 and realized it was all for nothing	30	6	4
398	 and set out on the path to righteousness.	30	6	4
399	 Book of the Stranger, verse 25.	30	6	4
400	" You know ""The Seven-Pointed Star."""	30	6	4
401	 Septa Unella reads it to me. At me.	30	6	4
402	 Yes, yes, she does enjoy reading at people.	30	6	4
403	 You're close.	30	6	4
404	 But it wasn't a graveyard.	31	6	4
405	 It was a feast.	31	6	4
406	 I bought old fine wine	31	6	4
407	 and young pretty girls	31	6	4
408	 and invited my friends to come and share it all.	31	6	4
409	 We passed around the wine, passed around the women,	31	6	4
410	 and soon we fell into a stupor.	31	6	4
411	 I woke before dawn.	31	6	4
412	 I could barely stand.	31	6	4
413	 Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor,	31	6	4
414	 lying in heaps next to their fine clothes.	31	6	4
415	 The truth of their bodies laid bare.	31	6	4
416	 I could smell them	31	6	4
417	 beneath the incense and the perfume	31	6	4
418	 and the fine food that had already started to turn.	31	6	4
419	 And I saw it with perfect clarity.	31	6	4
420	 I saw what my sins were.	31	6	4
421	 The gold I had, the wine I drank, the women I used,	32	6	4
422	 my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position.	32	6	4
423	 It was all part of a story.	32	6	4
424	 A story I was telling myself about who I was.	32	6	4
425	 A collection of lies	32	6	4
426	 that would disappear in the light.	32	6	4
427	 The people I was trying to climb away from,	32	6	4
428	 the beggars in the street,	32	6	4
429	 the poor,	32	6	4
430	 they were closer to the truth than I ever was.	32	6	4
431	 So what did you do?	32	6	4
432	 I left to go and find them.	32	6	4
433	 I didn't even put on my shoes.	32	6	4
434	 I walked out the door and never went back.	32	6	4
435	 Come, let's go and see him.	32	6	4
436	 - Who? - Your brother.	33	6	4
437	 Loras.	33	6	4
438	 Loras.	33	6	4
439	 Listen to me.	33	6	4
440	 You need to stay strong.	33	6	4
441	 I can't stay strong.	33	6	4
442	 I never was strong.	33	6	4
443	 You are strong.	34	6	4
444	 You are the future of our house,	34	6	4
445	 the future of our family.	34	6	4
446	 I don't care about that.	34	6	4
447	 Have you... have you told them that?	34	6	4
448	 That you don't care?	34	6	4
449	 I just want it to stop.	34	6	4
450	 Help me.	34	6	4
451	 They want me to help you.	34	6	4
452	 They want me to help tear you down.	34	6	4
453	 That's why he's letting me see you. I know it is.	34	6	4
454	 And if either of us give in to what they want, then they win.	34	6	4
455	 Let them win.	34	6	4
456	 Just make it stop.	34	6	4
457	 Please.	34	6	4
458	 All right.	34	6	4
459	 And now, how to avert disaster with our current predicament.	35	6	4
460	 This High Sparrow.	35	6	4
461	 I have dealt with fanatics of every description, Your Grace.	35	6	4
462	 Not setting them off, that's the most important thing.	35	6	4
463	 You are beset with enemies both within and without.	35	6	4
464	 What are you doing here?	35	6	4
465	 I am advising the king on our current predicament.	35	6	4
466	 - Leave. - I am a member of the small council.	35	6	4
467	 The king...	35	6	4
468	 Is this a small council meeting?	35	6	4
469	 Obviously not.	35	6	4
470	 I'm here to lend my wisdom and my support.	35	6	4
471	 Thank you for your counsel, Grand Maester.	35	6	4
472	 That will be all for now.	35	6	4
473	 Your Grace.	35	6	4
474	 Since I've missed the past several small council meetings,	36	6	4
475	 I wanted to speak to you about a few things.	36	6	4
476	 I've been thinking about the High Sparrow.	36	6	4
477	 As have we all, unfortunately.	36	6	4
478	 We need to be careful in dealing with such a man.	36	6	4
479	 To prevent things from escalating any further.	36	6	4
480	 We have to be careful not to antagonize him.	36	6	4
481	 He has Margaery. We can't put her at risk.	36	6	4
482	 - He's dangerous. - Look at me.	36	6	4
483	 What did they do to me?	36	6	4
484	 To the king's own mother?	36	6	4
485	 It's all right.	36	6	4
486	 It's done. It's in the past.	36	6	4
487	 And of course	36	6	4
488	 Margaery's safety is paramount.	36	6	4
489	 You don't like Margaery, do you?	36	6	4
490	 Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant.	37	6	4
491	 Margaery is the queen.	37	6	4
492	 Queens must command respect. Kings even more so.	37	6	4
493	 Not just for their own sake, but for everyone's.	37	6	4
494	 The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens.	37	6	4
495	 No respect for anything in this world.	37	6	4
496	 He has no use for the things of this world.	37	6	4
497	 He wants to knock them down and replace them with what?	37	6	4
498	 With fantasies.	37	6	4
499	 With beggars in the street.	37	6	4
500	 With nothing.	37	6	4
501	 Mother...	37	6	4
502	 there's something I want to tell you.	37	6	4
503	 Something the High Sparrow told me.	37	6	4
504	 You've spoken with him?	37	6	4
505	 I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone. If he found out I told...	37	6	4
506	 It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly	38	6	4
507	 given his constant prattling about the truth.	38	6	4
508	 I am your mother.	38	6	4
509	 You can always trust me.	38	6	4
510	 The small council meeting has been postponed on the king's orders.	38	6	4
511	 I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time.	38	6	4
512	 - You're not welcome. - You once spoke of your respect for our father	38	6	4
513	 because he understood the necessity of working with one's rivals.	38	6	4
514	 My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority,	38	6	4
515	 publically shamed, and confined to the Red Keep.	38	6	4
516	 What's left to work with?	38	6	4
517	 Cersei is the mother of the king.	38	6	4
518	 She has the king's ear and his trust.	38	6	4
519	 And the king has been speaking regularly	38	6	4
520	 with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.	38	6	4
521	 The High Sparrow seized power	38	6	4
522	 knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back.	38	6	4
523	 Here we are. Well done to us.	39	6	4
524	 Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms	39	6	4
525	 rests in his dirty peasant hands.	39	6	4
526	 In a few days, he'll have a trial for me.	39	6	4
527	 But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement.	39	6	4
528	 Yes, Margaery will repent her sins	39	6	4
529	 before the good people of the city.	39	6	4
530	 Oh, no.	39	6	4
531	 That cannot happen.	39	6	4
532	 That will not happen.	39	6	4
533	 I agree.	39	6	4
534	 You've got the second largest army in Westeros.	39	6	4
535	 You'll bring them into the city,	39	6	4
536	 stop Queen Margaery's humiliation before it starts,	39	6	4
537	 and take her back into Crown custody.	39	6	4
538	 The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow	39	6	4
539	 or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queen's safety.	39	6	4
540	 You will take no action at all.	39	6	4
541	 When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down.	39	6	4
542	 Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?	39	6	4
543	 No, but if the king should call...	39	6	4
544	 The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything.	40	6	4
545	 When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably,	40	6	4
546	 and Margaery's back at Tommen's side,	40	6	4
547	 do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?	40	6	4
548	 You hate these fanatics as much as we do.	40	6	4
549	 You hate what they've done to your son.	40	6	4
550	 Do you want Lancel back?	40	6	4
551	 Or have you given him up for good?	40	6	4
552	 Of course I want him back.	40	6	4
553	 Then stand aside	40	6	4
554	 and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.	40	6	4
555	 If it doesn't go as planned,	40	6	4
556	 the sparrows have many friends in this city.	40	6	4
557	 We'll have civil war. Many will die.	40	6	4
558	 Many will die no matter what we do.	40	6	4
559	 Better them than us.	40	6	4
560	 They told me you were home and I didn't believe it.	41	6	4
561	" ""Theon Greyjoy?"" I said."	41	6	4
562	" ""He's dead."	41	6	4
563	" He's been dead a long time."""	42	6	4
564	 He let you go?	42	6	4
565	 I escaped.	42	6	4
566	 I can't hear you.	42	6	4
567	 I escaped.	42	6	4
568	 Look at me.	42	6	4
569	 Look at me!	42	6	4
570	 Men died trying to rescue you.	42	6	4
571	 Good men.	42	6	4
572	 My men.	42	6	4
573	 I'm sorry.	42	6	4
574	 You were my brother.	42	6	4
575	 You were a spoiled little cunt, but you were my brother	42	6	4
576	 and I risked everything for you	42	6	4
577	 and you betrayed me.	42	6	4
578	 I know. I know and I'm sorry.	42	6	4
579	 Stop saying that.	42	6	4
580	 He broke me.	42	6	4
581	 He broke me into 1,000 pieces.	42	6	4
582	 - I know. - You don't know.	43	6	4
583	 He sent us one of those pieces.	43	6	4
584	 That's why I came for you.	43	6	4
585	 Why did you come here?	43	6	4
586	 Where else could I go?	43	6	4
587	 You heard Father was dead and you thought you'd claim the crown?	43	6	4
588	 No, no. I only heard he died after we docked.	43	6	4
589	 You happen to show up on Pyke right before the kingsmoot?	43	6	4
590	 I didn't know.	43	6	4
591	 You think any ironborn wants you to be king	43	6	4
592	 after what you've done?	43	6	4
593	 I don't want to be king.	43	6	4
594	 What do you want?	43	6	4
595	 I should have listened to you. You're the only one...	43	6	4
596	 That doesn't matter anymore. Stop crying.	43	6	4
597	 Look at me.	43	6	4
598	 Tell me what you want.	43	6	4
599	 You should rule the Iron Islands.	43	6	4
600	 Let me help you.	43	6	4
601	 They've cleaned you up nicely.	44	6	4
602	 You know who I am?	44	6	4
603	 A lord.	44	6	4
604	 Yes.	44	6	4
605	 A lord.	44	6	4
606	 You've seen my banners?	44	6	4
607	 The flayed man.	44	6	4
608	 Does that worry you at all?	44	6	4
609	 You eat them after?	44	6	4
610	 No.	44	6	4
611	 Then I've seen worse.	44	6	4
612	 You served the Starks?	45	6	4
613	 Aye. They put me in chains	45	6	4
614	 and put a sword at my throat,	45	6	4
615	 so I served them.	45	6	4
616	 The Starks have been gone for a long time,	45	6	4
617	 but you kept protecting Rickon.	45	6	4
618	 He'd fetch a good price to the right buyer.	45	6	4
619	 I served his family a long time.	45	6	4
620	 Didn't get no wages.	45	6	4
621	 Way I see it, I'm owed.	45	6	4
622	 Be that as it may,	45	6	4
623	 Rickon's not yours to sell anymore.	45	6	4
624	 He's mine.	45	6	4
625	 So what use could I possibly have for you?	45	6	4
626	 I can give you what you want.	46	6	4
627	 And you're sure you know what that is?	46	6	4
628	 Same thing men always want.	46	6	4
629	 And when they really want it, they give it a bath first.	46	6	4
630	 You're a good talker.	46	6	4
631	 I like that.	46	6	4
632	 You're a much better talker than Theon Greyjoy.	46	6	4
633	 That so?	46	6	4
634	 I had to work hard to get him talking.	46	6	4
635	 But he talked.	46	6	4
636	 They all do.	46	6	4
637	 He told me everything.	46	6	4
638	 All about the Stark boys,	46	6	4
639	 who helped them escape,	47	6	4
640	 and how she did it.	47	6	4
641	 Open the gate!	47	6	4
642	 Sorry about the food.	48	6	4
643	 It's not what we're known for.	48	6	4
644	 That's all right. There are more important things.	48	6	4
645	 A letter for you, Lord Commander.	48	6	4
646	 I'm not Lord Commander anymore.	48	6	4
647	" ""To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow."	49	6	4
648	 You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall.	49	6	4
649	 You have betrayed your own kind.	49	6	4
650	 You have betrayed the North.	49	6	4
651	 Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see.	49	6	4
652	 Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon.	49	6	4
653	 His direwolf's skin is on my floor.	49	6	4
654	 Come and see. I want my bride back.	49	6	4
655	 Send her to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers.	49	6	4
656	 Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter	49	6	4
657	 every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection.	49	6	4
658	" You will watch as I skin them living. You... """	49	6	4
659	 Go on.	49	6	4
660	 It's just more of the same.	49	6	4
661	" ""You will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sister."	49	6	4
662	 You will watch as my dogs	50	6	4
663	 devour your wild little brother.	50	6	4
664	 Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest.	50	6	4
665	 Come and see. Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell	50	6	4
666	" and Warden of the North."""	50	6	4
667	 Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.	50	6	4
668	 His father's dead.	50	6	4
669	 Ramsay killed him.	50	6	4
670	 - And now he has Rickon. - We don't know that.	50	6	4
671	 Yes, we do.	50	6	4
672	 How many men does he have in his army?	50	6	4
673	 I heard him say 5,000 once when he was talking about Stannis's attack.	50	6	4
674	 How many do you have?	50	6	4
675	 That can march and fight?	50	6	4
676	 2,000.	50	6	4
677	 The rest are children and old people.	50	6	4
678	 You're the son of the last true Warden of the North.	51	6	4
679	 Northern families are loyal. They'll fight for you if you ask.	51	6	4
680	 A monster has taken our home and our brother.	51	6	4
681	 We have to go back to Winterfell and save them both.	51	6	4

2	 My son.	1	6	8
3	 My firstborn son.	2	6	8
4	 My child king, hush.	2	6	8
5	 Listen to the gods, for you they sing.	2	6	8
6	 Fight no more, sweet child. Your wars are won.	2	6	8
7	 The wolves are buried	2	6	8
8	 and the false stag done.	2	6	8
9	 Shut your blue eyes, my love. Let the crown fall.	2	6	8
10	 The Father above beckons you to his hall.	2	6	8
11	 In Seventh Heaven I'll see you once more.	2	6	8
12	 But now I seek vengeance on Sansa the whore	2	6	8
13	 and my brother the Imp	2	6	8
14	 who killed his own king.	2	6	8
15	 Born amongst lions, our curse from within. I will slay him, I swear.	2	6	8
16	 With noose or with knife, though it take me a fortnight,	3	6	8
17	 a moon or my life.	3	6	8
18	 What is that I hear and smell?	3	6	8
19	 Someone I'll soon send to hell.	3	6	8
20	 It's time to see if truth they told	3	6	8
21	 who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.	3	6	8
22	 Get the wig!	3	6	8
23	 You beast, you beast. You killed my wife.	3	6	8
24	 And now you've taken your father's life.	3	6	8
25	 No worse child ever stained this land.	3	6	8
26	 I curse the day I named you.	4	6	8
27	 My greatest crime!	4	6	8
28	 You're good at that.	4	6	8
29	 Where did you learn?	4	6	8
30	 I'm a jealous woman.	4	6	8
31	 I've always liked bad men and they've always liked me.	4	6	8
32	 They'd come home wherever home was that night	4	6	8
33	 stinking of some whore's perfume.	4	6	8
34	 So we'd fight and I'd put a hole in them. And then I'd feel terrible,	5	6	8
35	 so I'd patch them up. I got good at patching them up.	5	6	8
36	 And good at putting holes in them.	5	6	8
37	 And that.	5	6	8
38	 What happened to the actress?	5	6	8
39	 The one who wanted you dead.	5	6	8
40	 Bianca.	5	6	8
41	 She'll have a hard time finding work as an actress after what I did to her face.	5	6	8
42	 Mmm.	5	6	8
43	 I never did learn to cook.	5	6	8
44	 But eat. Eat. You need it.	5	6	8
45	 The company is moving on to Pentos soon.	5	6	8
46	 You should come with us.	5	6	8
47	 - I can't. - Why not?	5	6	8
48	 Got a feeling you'd be good at this sort of work.	5	6	8
49	 And besides, we need a new actress.	5	6	8
50	 I don't think I could remember all of the lines.	5	6	8
51	 Come with us.	6	6	8
52	 What's left for you here?	6	6	8
53	 You wouldn't be safe.	6	6	8
54	 Not while she's looking for me.	6	6	8
55	 Who?	6	6	8
56	 She doesn't have a name.	6	6	8
57	 Where will you go?	6	6	8
58	 Essos is east and Westeros is west.	6	6	8
59	 But what's west of Westeros?	6	6	8
60	 I don't know.	6	6	8
61	 Nobody does.	6	6	8
62	 - That's where all the maps stop. - The edge of the world, maybe.	6	6	8
63	 I'd like to see that.	6	6	8
64	 - What's that? - Milk of the poppy.	6	6	8
65	 I don't want any.	6	6	8
66	 Sleep is the only way you'll heal.	6	6	8
67	 Trust me,	7	6	8
68	 if my soup didn't kill you, nothing will.	7	6	8
69	 Thing about Gatins, right, is he used to be pretty.	7	6	8
70	 I was a famous kisser.	7	6	8
71	 You lads know how to kiss proper?	7	6	8
72	 - Course we do. - This is for masters, this technique.	7	6	8
73	 - You're not ready. - I'm ready.	8	6	8
74	 He says he's ready.	8	6	8
75	 All right.	8	6	8
76	 Now, pay attention.	8	6	8
77	 You put your left hand on the back of the lady's head.	8	6	8
78	 Your right hand holds the small of the lady's back like so.	8	6	8
79	 Very romantic.	8	6	8
80	 Take your middle finger, yeah,	8	6	8
81	 and you jam it right up her bunghole.	8	6	8
82	 So fucking close!	8	6	8
83	 Ah, it smells like pussy to me.	8	6	8
84	 Look at him. You get hard, boy?	8	6	8
85	 Fuck you!	8	6	8
86	 Disgusting old twats.	8	6	8
87	 Got off on that, did you, you old fuck?	8	6	8
88	 Where's the other one?	9	6	8
89	 - The one with the yellow cloak. - Fuck you!	9	6	8
90	 Those are your last words, fuck you? Come on, you can do better.	9	6	8
91	 Cunt!	9	6	8
92	 You're shit at dying, you know that?	9	6	8
93	 _	9	6	8
94	 _	9	6	8
95	 _	9	6	8
96	 _	9	6	8
97	 - I'd call that a successful gambit. - Would you?	9	6	8
98	 Look around. The city has come back to life.	10	6	8
99	 - You made a pact with fanatics. - I did and it worked.	10	6	8
100	 If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you'd say the razor worked.	10	6	8
101	 That doesn't mean it won't cut your throat.	10	6	8
102	 Spoken like a man who has never had to shave.	10	6	8
103	 I'm going to miss you.	10	6	8
104	 I know.	10	6	8
105	 I hope you're right about this expedition of yours.	10	6	8
106	 If I don't return, you'll know I was wrong.	10	6	8
107	 We need friends in Westeros. And we need ships.	10	6	8
108	 Most of all, we need our queen.	10	6	8
109	 She'll come back.	10	6	8
110	 She has to.	10	6	8
111	 My heart's been broken too many times already.	10	6	8
112	 I'll walk the rest of the way myself.	10	6	8
113	 I can't go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city.	10	6	8
114	 Varys.	11	6	8
115	 The most famous dwarf in the world.	11	6	8
116	 Your Grace, several members of the Faith Militant	11	6	8
117	 have been permitted entry to the Red Keep.	11	6	8
118	 Have been permitted?	11	6	8
119	 That's rather a tortured way of putting it.	11	6	8
120	 They demand to see you, Your Grace.	11	6	8
121	 Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?	11	6	8
122	 The king is aware of their presence?	11	6	8
123	 He is, Your Grace. He's currently in his chambers at prayer.	11	6	8
124	 Your Grace, His Holiness the High Septon	12	6	8
125	 wishes to speak with you at the Great Sept of Baelor.	12	6	8
126	 His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.	12	6	8
127	 Your Grace,	12	6	8
128	 - this is not a request. - It is a request, Cousin Lancel.	12	6	8
129	 You are asking me for something, I'm refusing.	12	6	8
130	 The High Septon commands you.	12	6	8
131	 Are you sure you want to refuse him?	12	6	8
132	 He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep	12	6	8
133	 - until my trial. - He made no such promises.	12	6	8
134	 - If you refuse to come of your own free will... - Get out.	12	6	8
135	 Move aside, ser.	13	6	8
136	 Order your man to step aside or there will be violence.	13	6	8
137	 I choose violence.	13	6	8
138	 Please tell His High Holiness he's always welcome to visit.	14	6	8
139	 Looks like a siege, my lady.	14	6	8
140	 You have a keen military mind, Pod.	14	6	8
141	 My lady.	14	6	8
142	 My lady!	14	6	8
143	 Who goes there?!	14	6	8
144	 State your business!	14	6	8
145	 My name is Brienne of Tarth.	14	6	8
146	 Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I've come to speak with him.	14	6	8
147	 Tell him I have his sword.	14	6	8
148	 Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren't we?	15	6	8
149	 Podrick fucking Payne.	15	6	8
150	 - I thought you'd be dead by now. - Not yet.	15	6	8
151	 - Are they in there? - Uh-huh.	15	6	8
152	 You think they're fucking?	15	6	8
153	 What?	15	6	8
154	 No.	15	6	8
155	 Why not?	15	6	8
156	 I'd fuck her.	15	6	8
157	 - You'd fuck her, wouldn't you? - I'm her squire. - Oh.	15	6	8
158	 Well, he'd fuck her, that's for sure.	15	6	8
159	 And she'd fuck him, don't you think?	15	6	8
160	 The way she looks at him.	15	6	8
161	 The way all women look at him is frankly irritating.	15	6	8
162	 I preferred working with the little brother on that account.	15	6	8
163	 Come on, you're the one with the magic cock.	15	6	8
164	 You must have shown it to her by now.	15	6	8
165	 She's training me to fight.	15	6	8
166	 Is she? Oh.	16	6	8
167	 An hour in the morning, an hour at night.	16	6	8
168	 Every day.	16	6	8
169	 Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?	16	6	8
170	 - Well, that's a different sort of fighting. - Now, that's the truth, isn't it?	16	6	8
171	 You want to learn that sort of fighting?	16	6	8
172	 All right.	16	6	8
173	 All right, let's start with your footwork.	16	6	8
174	 Show me your stance.	16	6	8
175	 Now listen to me, Pod.	16	6	8
176	 See how your feet are about a yard apart?	16	6	8
177	 Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you.	16	6	8
178	 'Cause they do, Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire.	16	6	8
179	 Do it again. Come on, don't sulk.	16	6	8
180	 I never thought you'd find her.	16	6	8
181	 I just assumed Sansa was dead.	16	6	8
182	 Why would you assume that?	16	6	8
183	 In my experience, girls like her don't live very long.	16	6	8
184	 I don't think you know many girls like her.	16	6	8
185	 Well, I'm proud of you.	16	6	8
186	 I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds.	16	6	8
187	 Of course, my sister wants Sansa dead.	17	6	8
188	 The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey's murder, so there is that complication.	17	6	8
189	 What the hell are you doing here?	17	6	8
190	 I've come for the Blackfish.	17	6	8
191	 You're welcome to have him.	17	6	8
192	 Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons	17	6	8
193	 and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.	17	6	8
194	 With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?	17	6	8
195	 - The Tully army. - They're a bit occupied at the moment.	17	6	8
196	 I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels,	17	6	8
197	 so you can see the conundrum.	17	6	8
198	 The Tullys are rebels because they're fighting for their home?	17	6	8
199	 Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.	17	6	8
200	 As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.	17	6	8
201	 Exactly.	17	6	8
202	 We shouldn't argue about politics.	17	6	8
203	 You're a knight, Ser Jaime.	17	6	8
204	 I know there is honor in you.	17	6	8
205	 - I've seen it myself. - I'm a Lannister.	17	6	8
206	 Don't ask me to betray my own house.	18	6	8
207	 I do no such thing.	18	6	8
208	 Take Riverrun without bloodshed.	18	6	8
209	 Ride south again with your mission complete and your army intact.	18	6	8
210	 What do you propose?	18	6	8
211	 Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce.	18	6	8
212	 Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.	18	6	8
213	 Why would he abandon his ancestral home?	18	6	8
214	 Because you'll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.	18	6	8
215	 Have you ever met the Blackfish?	18	6	8
216	 - No. - He's even more stubborn than you are.	18	6	8
217	 All right. Try to talk some sense into the old goat.	18	6	8
218	 He won't listen, but his men might.	18	6	8
219	 Not everybody wants to die for someone else's home.	18	6	8
220	 I need your word.	18	6	8
221	 If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you'll grant a safe passage north.	18	6	8
222	 You have my word.	18	6	8
223	 You have until nightfall.	18	6	8
224	 You gave it to me for a purpose.	19	6	8
225	 I've achieved that purpose.	19	6	8
226	 It's yours.	19	6	8
227	 It will always be yours.	19	6	8
228	 One last thing, Ser Jaime.	19	6	8
229	 Yes, Lady Brienne?	19	6	8
230	 Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender	19	6	8
231	 and if you attack the castle,	19	6	8
232	 honor compels me to fight for Sansa's kin.	19	6	8
233	 Of course it does.	19	6	8
234	 To fight you.	19	6	8
235	 Let's hope it doesn't come to that.	20	6	8
236	 I've said no three times already.	20	6	8
237	 I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.	20	6	8
238	 I haven't seen her since she was a child.	20	6	8
239	 I don't know her signature. I don't know you.	20	6	8
240	 And I will not surrender.	20	6	8
241	 Double the guards tonight.	20	6	8
242	 The Kingslayer wants to try us.	20	6	8
243	 I can feel it.	20	6	8
244	 - As I have said, my name is... - Yes, Brienne of Tarth. I know your father.	20	6	8
245	 - Good man. - He always spoke highly of you.	20	6	8
246	 And if he were here now, I'd tell him the same I'm telling you.	20	6	8
247	 If you think I'm abandoning my family's seat	20	6	8
248	 on the Kingslayer's word of honor, you're a bloody fool.	20	6	8
249	 Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.	20	6	8
250	 We can stand longer than your one-handed friend thinks we can.	20	6	8
251	 He's not my friend.	20	6	8
252	 No?	20	6	8
253	 Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle?	20	6	8
254	 Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?	21	6	8
255	 Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark.	21	6	8
256	 He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted.	21	6	8
257	 He gave me this sword to protect her.	21	6	8
258	 That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die.	21	6	8
259	 She's exactly like her mother.	21	6	8
260	 I don't have enough men to help her take Winterfell.	21	6	8
261	 You have more than she does.	21	6	8
262	 She wants her home back. I understand that.	21	6	8
263	 But this is my home.	21	6	8
264	 And if Jaime Lannister wants it,	21	6	8
265	 he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does.	21	6	8
266	 Find the maester.	22	6	8
267	 We need to get a raven north to Sansa.	22	6	8
268	 What should I write?	22	6	8
269	 Tell her I failed.	22	6	8
270	 There's to be a royal announcement?	23	6	8
271	 There is.	23	6	8
272	 Why wasn't I informed?	23	6	8
273	 There is to be a royal announcement	23	6	8
274	 in the throne room	23	6	8
275	 at this very moment.	23	6	8
276	 Where are you going?	23	6	8
277	 To stand by my son.	23	6	8
278	 Your place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court.	23	6	8
279	 Your Grace...	23	6	8
280	 Lords and ladies,	23	6	8
281	 the Faith and the Crown	24	6	8
282	 are the two pillars that hold up this world.	24	6	8
283	 One collapses, so does the other.	24	6	8
284	 The Father judges us all.	24	6	8
285	 If you break his laws...	24	6	8
286	 you will be punished.	24	6	8
287	 After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon,	24	6	8
288	 we have determined that Loras Tyrell and Cersei Lannister's trial	24	6	8
289	 will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor on the first day of the Festival of the Mother.	24	6	8
290	 Furthermore, after much prayer and reflection,	24	6	8
291	 the Crown has decided that from this day forward,	24	6	8
292	 trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the Seven Kingdoms.	24	6	8
293	 The tradition is a brutish one,	24	6	8
294	 a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods.	25	6	8
295	 Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell	25	6	8
296	 will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the Faith.	25	6	8
297	 Seven blessings to all.	25	6	8
298	 Seven blessings.	25	6	8
299	 Your Grace...	25	6	8
300	 that old rumor you told me about.	25	6	8
301	 My little birds investigated.	25	6	8
302	 And?	25	6	8
303	 Was it just a rumor or something more?	25	6	8
304	 More.	25	6	8
305	 Much more.	26	6	8
306	 You seem happy.	26	6	8
307	 I am happy.	26	6	8
308	 You should both be happy as well.	26	6	8
309	 Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself.	26	6	8
310	 - Now it's like a man reborn. - I will be happy when our queen returns.	26	6	8
311	 Why don't you drink? Why don't either of you ever drink?	26	6	8
312	 Unsullied never drink.	26	6	8
313	 - Why not? - Rules.	26	6	8
314	 And who made these rules?	26	6	8
315	 Your former masters?	26	6	8
316	 Those miserable old shits didn't want you to be human.	26	6	8
317	 Have a drink with me.	26	6	8
318	 And you?	26	6	8
319	 What's your excuse?	26	6	8
320	 I have tried wine before. It made me feel funny.	26	6	8
321	 That's how you know it's working.	26	6	8
322	 Here's to our queen.	26	6	8
323	 Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.	27	6	8
324	 To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains,	27	6	8
325	 long may she reign.	27	6	8
326	 - Long may she reign. - Long may she reign.	27	6	8
327	 - Do you like it? - Tastes like it has turned.	27	6	8
328	 Yes, yes. Fermentation.	27	6	8
329	 One day,	27	6	8
330	 after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...	27	6	8
331	 I'd like to have my own vineyard.	27	6	8
332	 Make my own wine.	27	6	8
333	 The Imp's Delight.	27	6	8
334	 Only my close friends could drink it.	27	6	8
335	 Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.	27	6	8
336	 I do not know any jokes.	27	6	8
337	 Grey Worm?	27	6	8
338	 Right.	28	6	8
339	 Three lords walk into a tavern... a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister.	28	6	8
340	 They order ale, but when the barkeep brings them over,	28	6	8
341	 each of them finds a fly in his cup.	28	6	8
342	 The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another.	28	6	8
343	 The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole.	28	6	8
344	 The Stark reaches into his cup,	28	6	8
345	 pulls out the fly and shouts,	28	6	8
346	" ""Spit it out, you wee shit. Spit it out."""	28	6	8
347	 It's funnier in Westeros.	28	6	8
348	 The Starks and the Lannisters, I thought these were enemies.	28	6	8
349	 Yes.	28	6	8
350	 A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho.	28	6	8
351	 - Not a true story, necessarily. - A story that's supposed to make you laugh...	28	6	8
352	 ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps.	29	6	8
353	 Missandei, do you like the wine?	29	6	8
354	 I do.	29	6	8
355	 Tell a joke.	29	6	8
356	 Two translators are on a sinking ship.	29	6	8
357	 The first says,	29	6	8
358	" ""Do you know how to swim?"""	29	6	8
359	" The second says, ""No, but I can shout for help in 19 languages."""	29	6	8
360	 Ah!	29	6	8
361	 That is the worst joke I ever heard.	29	6	8
362	 You don't even know what a joke is.	29	6	8
363	 I am soldier all my life. You think I never hear joke?	29	6	8
364	 You lied to us.	29	6	8
365	 I make joke.	29	6	8
366	 More jokes.	30	6	8
367	 I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass.	30	6	8
368	 The madam says...	30	6	8
369	 The Masters have come for their property.	30	6	8
370	 Lord Edmure.	30	6	8
371	 I apologize for the way the Freys treated you.	30	6	8
372	 A man of your birth deserves better.	30	6	8
373	 You have my word you'll be properly fed and clothed from now on.	30	6	8
374	 I have your word?	30	6	8
375	 Oh, good.	31	6	8
376	 Good, that's...	31	6	8
377	 that's a fine thing.	31	6	8
378	 My uncle will never surrender the castle, ser.	31	6	8
379	 - Whatever game you're playing. - The Blackfish is an old man.	31	6	8
380	 A good death is all he can hope for. But you, you have a child now, I've heard.	31	6	8
381	 A son you sired on your wedding night. You're a potent man.	31	6	8
382	 A son I've never met	31	6	8
383	 born of a wife that I haven't seen since our first night together.	31	6	8
384	 You should be with them both.	31	6	8
385	 I can arrange that, you realize?	31	6	8
386	 Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock.	31	6	8
387	 A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride.	31	6	8
388	 And when he comes of age,	31	6	8
389	 - he'll have a keep of his own. - Do you imagine yourself a decent person?	31	6	8
390	 Is that it?	31	6	8
391	 After you've massacred my family.	31	6	8
392	 Kept me in a cell for years.	32	6	8
393	 Stolen our lands.	32	6	8
394	 I'll remind you that our houses are at war.	32	6	8
395	 I'm sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you,	32	6	8
396	 but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences.	32	6	8
397	 Says the man who shoved his sword through his king's back.	32	6	8
398	 Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation? It's not.	32	6	8
399	 You understand. On some level you understand	32	6	8
400	 - that you're an evil man. - I'll leave the judgments to the gods.	32	6	8
401	 Well, that is convenient for you.	32	6	8
402	 You're a fine-looking fellow, aren't you?	32	6	8
403	 Your square jaw,	32	6	8
404	 your golden armor.	32	6	8
405	 Tell me,	32	6	8
406	 I want to know. I truly do. How do you live with yourself?	32	6	8
407	 All of us have to believe that we're decent, don't we?	32	6	8
408	 You have to sleep at night.	33	6	8
409	 How do you tell yourself	33	6	8
410	 that you're decent after everything that you've done?	33	6	8
411	 I was your sister's prisoner once.	33	6	8
412	 She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.	33	6	8
413	 Yeah.	33	6	8
414	 - She should have killed you. - Perhaps, but she didn't.	33	6	8
415	 Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me.	33	6	8
416	 But I didn't hate her.	33	6	8
417	 I admired her.	33	6	8
418	 Far more than her husband or her son.	33	6	8
419	 Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you don't?	33	6	8
420	 No, I don't, but I'm telling you anyway because you're my prisoner. You don't have a choice.	33	6	8
421	 The love she had for her children, I was a little awed by it.	33	6	8
422	 Reminded me of my sister.	34	6	8
423	 Oh, I see.	34	6	8
424	 - You're a madman. - I'm not here to trade insults.	34	6	8
425	 - Your sister was a strong... - Don't talk about Cat!	34	6	8
426	 I'll talk about whomever I want.	34	6	8
427	 She loved her children.	34	6	8
428	 I suppose all mothers do, but Catelyn and Cersei,	34	6	8
429	 there's a fierceness you don't often see.	34	6	8
430	 They'd do anything to protect their babies.	34	6	8
431	 Start a war.	34	6	8
432	 Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies.	34	6	8
433	 The things we do for love.	34	6	8
434	 You didn't come here to talk about our sisters.	34	6	8
435	 That's exactly why I came here.	34	6	8
436	 I love Cersei.	34	6	8
437	 You can laugh at that if you want. You can sneer. Doesn't matter.	34	6	8
438	 She needs me.	35	6	8
439	 And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun.	35	6	8
440	 I'll send for your baby boy.	35	6	8
441	 And I'll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult.	35	6	8
442	 Because you don't matter to me, Lord Edmure.	35	6	8
443	 Your son doesn't matter to me.	35	6	8
444	 The people in the castle don't matter to me.	35	6	8
445	 Only Cersei.	35	6	8
446	 And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her,	35	6	8
447	 that's what I'll do.	35	6	8
448	 Who goes there?	36	6	8
449	 Edmure Tully, son of Hoster Tully	36	6	8
450	 and the rightful Lord of Riverrun.	36	6	8
451	 I demand entry.	36	6	8
452	 Don't let him in.	36	6	8
453	 He's the Lord of Riverrun. I have to obey his commands.	36	6	8
454	 He's been their captive ever since they murdered his king at the Red Wedding.	36	6	8
455	 Why do you think the people who murdered his king at the Red Wedding	36	6	8
456	 would decide to let him come home?	36	6	8
457	 Because it's a trap, you idiot.	36	6	8
458	 - Don't let him in. - He's my lord, my lord.	36	6	8
459	 I've sworn to serve the Lord of Riverrun and obey his commands.	36	6	8
460	 You're not obeying Edmure's commands.	36	6	8
461	 You're obeying the fucking Kingslayer's commands.	36	6	8
462	 I demand entry.	36	6	8
463	 - My lord has given an order. - With a knife to his throat.	36	6	8
464	 That is not a valid order.	37	6	8
465	 Lower the drawbridge and open the gate for Lord Ed...	37	6	8
466	 Aye, ser.	37	6	8
467	 I'll have your head before I surrender Riverrun.	37	6	8
468	 You are not lord of this castle, my lord.	37	6	8
469	 - Lower the drawbridge. - Aye, ser!	37	6	8
470	 If you're wrong,	38	6	8
471	 we've just surrendered our most valuable prisoner.	38	6	8
472	 Welcome home, my lord.	39	6	8
473	 Command all the forces within the castle to lay down their arms.	39	6	8
474	 Open the gates.	39	6	8
475	 - My lord... - Your lord has given a command.	39	6	8
476	 Infantry, advance!	39	6	8
477	 Find the Blackfish.	40	6	8
478	 Put him in irons and hand him over to the Freys.	40	6	8
479	 Find him.	40	6	8
480	 Go on.	40	6	8
481	 - Come with us. - I've run before from the Red Wedding.	40	6	8
482	 I'm not running again. This is my family home.	40	6	8
483	 Your family is in the North.	41	6	8
484	 Come with us.	41	6	8
485	 Don't die for pride when you can fight for your blood.	41	6	8
486	 You'll serve Sansa far better than I ever could.	41	6	8
487	 All the way down!	41	6	8
488	 - Check that out! - Go on, now.	41	6	8
489	 I haven't had a proper sword fight in years.	41	6	8
490	 I expect I'll make a damn fool of myself.	41	6	8
491	 We found the Blackfish, my lord.	42	6	8
492	 Good.	42	6	8
493	 Bring him to me.	42	6	8
494	 He died fighting, my lord.	42	6	8
495	 - I was wrong. I admit it. - That changes nothing.	43	6	8
496	 The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead.	43	6	8
497	 - If the slavers' forces... - No more talking from you. Your talking gave us this.	43	6	8
498	 And I have acknowledged that. I'm trying...	43	6	8
499	 You're trying to tell me what the army should do. You do not know what the army should do.	43	6	8
500	 All right, what should the army do?	43	6	8
501	 We'll not go to the beach.	44	6	8
502	 If we go to the beach, the Masters will take the pyramid.	44	6	8
503	 The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend. We stay here.	44	6	8
504	 - And then? - We wait for them to come to us.	44	6	8
505	 Then we fight them.	44	6	8
506	 Clegane.	45	6	8
507	 What the fuck you doing here?	45	6	8
508	 Chasing them.	45	6	8
509	 - You? - Hanging them.	45	6	8
510	 - Any particular reason? - They're our men. Or they were.	45	6	8
511	 They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers.	45	6	8
512	 - Why do you want them? - Same reason.	45	6	8
513	 I was helping build it.	45	6	8
514	 They killed a friend of mine.	45	6	8
515	 You've got friends?	45	6	8
516	 Not anymore.	45	6	8
517	 They're mine.	45	6	8
518	 It's the Brotherhood's good name they've dragged through the dirt.	45	6	8
519	 Fuck your name. They're mine. I killed you once before, Dondarrion.	45	6	8
520	 Happy to do it again.	45	6	8
521	 Drop that arrow, you bloody girl.	46	6	8
522	 Tougher girls than you have tried to kill me.	46	6	8
523	 You can have one of them.	46	6	8
524	 Two.	46	6	8
525	 No, no, no.	46	6	8
526	 We're not butchers.	46	6	8
527	 - We hang them. - Hanging?	46	6	8
528	 All over in an instant. Where's the punishment in that?	46	6	8
529	 - They die. - We all bloody die.	46	6	8
530	 Except this one here.	46	6	8
531	 I'll only gut one of them.	46	6	8
532	 No.	46	6	8
533	 I'll chop off one hand.	46	6	8
534	 We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss.	46	6	8
535	 That's generous.	46	6	8
536	 Bunch of nancies.	46	6	8
537	 There was a time I would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three.	47	6	8
538	 You're getting old, Clegane.	47	6	8
539	 He's not.	47	6	8
540	 Please don't. I'll give you anything.	47	6	8
541	 Got anything to eat?	47	6	8
542	 Enjoying yourself?	47	6	8
543	 I prefer chicken.	47	6	8
544	 You ought to join us.	48	6	8
545	 We could use you.	48	6	8
546	 I tried joining.	48	6	8
547	 - Didn't work out for me. - Clegane we're here for a reason.	48	6	8
548	 The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason.	48	6	8
549	 He gave a failed, drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason.	48	6	8
550	 We are part of something larger than ourselves.	48	6	8
551	 Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves.	48	6	8
552	 Cold winds are rising in the North.	48	6	8
553	 And you're going to go stop them?	48	6	8
554	 We need good men to help us.	48	6	8
555	 Last time you saw me, you wanted to execute me.	48	6	8
556	 True enough.	48	6	8
557	 But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me.	48	6	8
558	 Why?	48	6	8
559	 I beat you because I'm better than you, Beric.	48	6	8
560	 I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord	49	6	8
561	 and I'm better than you now.	49	6	8
562	 Aye, you're probably right.	49	6	8
563	 You're a fighter.	49	6	8
564	 You were born a fighter.	49	6	8
565	 You walked away from the fight.	49	6	8
566	 How did that go?	49	6	8
567	 Good and bad, young and old,	49	6	8
568	 the things we're fighting will destroy them all alike.	49	6	8
569	 You can still help a lot more than you've harmed, Clegane.	49	6	8
570	 It's not too late for you.	49	6	8
571	 Lady Crane?	50	6	8
572	 Lady Crane?	50	6	8
573	 If you'd have done your job, she would have died painlessly.	51	6	8
574	 Instead...	51	6	8
575	 The Many-Faced God was promised a name.	51	6	8
576	 He must always receive what is his.	51	6	8
577	 You can't change that.	51	6	8
578	 I can't change that.	51	6	8
579	 No one can.	51	6	8
580	 And now he's been promised another name.	51	6	8
581	 Hey!	51	6	8
582	 Get out!	51	6	8
583	 Yah!	51	6	8
584	 Hey!	53	6	8
585	 Yah!	53	6	8
586	 Ah!	53	6	8
587	 My basket!	53	6	8
588	 It will all be over soon.	55	6	8
589	 On your knees or on your feet?	55	6	8
590	 Haven't we been through this already?	55	6	8
591	 That won't help you.	55	6	8
592	 You told her to kill me.	56	6	8
593	 Yes.	56	6	8
594	 But here you are.	57	6	8
595	 And there she is.	57	6	8
596	 Finally a girl is no one.	57	6	8
597	 A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell	57	6	8
598	 and I'm going home.	57	6	8
599		57	6	8
600		0	6	8
0	 5 It's got to be the Mountain. He's the biggest.	2	2	4
1	 - He's the strongest. - Bulls are bigger than lions.	2	2	4
2	 Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight.	2	2	4
3	 If the bull had fangs and claws, I would.	2	2	4
4	 Right, the Mountain or our man Jaime.	2	2	4
5	 If he ever gets out.	2	2	4
6	 Loras Tyrell?	2	2	4
7	 Loras Tyrell. He's prettier than the queen.	2	2	4
8	 I don't care about pretty.	2	2	4
9	 He's better with a sword than any of them.	2	2	4
10	 How good could he be?	2	2	4
11	 He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years,	2	2	4
12	 and Renly ain't dead.	2	2	4
13	 The horses seem a little spooked to you?	3	2	4
14	 They're horses.	3	2	4
15	 They get spooked by their own shadows.	3	2	4
16	 Shh.	3	2	4
17	 Do you hear that?	3	2	4
18	 No.	3	2	4
19	 There's something out there.	3	2	4
20	 Oh.	3	2	4
21	 Oh, you're a right little prick.	3	2	4
22	 You should see your face.	4	2	4
23	 I swear you pissed yourself.	4	2	4
24	" ""Oh, who goes there? Ahh!"""	4	2	4
25	 There is something out there.	4	2	4
26	 Yeah, don't even try me.	4	2	4
27	 - Rennick. - Do you think I'm an idiot?	4	2	4
28	 Rennick!	4	2	4
29	 - King in the North! - The King in the North!	4	2	4
30	 Five Lannisters dead for every one of ours.	4	2	4
31	 They're dead. Take everything they've got.	4	2	4
32	 We've nowhere to keep all these prisoners.	5	2	4
33	 Barely enough food to feed our own.	5	2	4
34	 We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton.	5	2	4
35	 Of course, Your Grace.	5	2	4
36	 The officers will be useful.	5	2	4
37	 Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannister's plans.	5	2	4
38	 I doubt it.	5	2	4
39	 Well, we'll learn soon enough.	5	2	4
40	" In my family we say, ""A naked man has few secrets."	5	2	4
41	" A flayed man none."""	5	2	4
42	 My father outlawed flaying in the North.	5	2	4
43	 - We're not in the North. - We're not torturing them.	5	2	4
44	 The high road's very pretty,	5	2	4
45	 but you'll have a hard time marching your army down it.	5	2	4
46	 The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own.	5	2	4
47	 I won't give them an excuse to abuse my sisters.	5	2	4
48	 No, no, don't! Don't!	5	2	4
49	 - Shh, shh. - Please!	5	2	4
50	 Shh.	5	2	4
51	 The rot's set in.	5	2	4
52	 No, don't! No, don't!	5	2	4
53	 - Shh. - Please, don't!	6	2	4
54	 It'll get better. It doesn't even hurt.	6	2	4
55	 The rot will spread. If we don't take the foot now--	6	2	4
56	 No, you can't!	6	2	4
57	 Ser! Please, Ser.	6	2	4
58	 - I can't lose-- - You'll die if she does it.	6	2	4
59	 I don't want to be a cripple, please.	6	2	4
60	 Surely one of our men needs your attention more than this cub.	6	2	4
61	 Your men are not my men, My Lord.	6	2	4
62	 Put this in your mouth and lie down. You don't want to watch.	6	2	4
63	 - No! You can't! - Bite on it.	6	2	4
64	 It's better than biting your own tongue, believe me.	6	2	4
65	 - What's your name? - Talisa.	7	2	4
66	 Your last name?	7	2	4
67	 You want to know what side my family fights on?	7	2	4
68	 You know my family name. You have me at a disadvantage.	7	2	4
69	 That boy lost his foot on your orders.	7	2	4
70	 They killed my father.	7	2	4
71	 - That boy did? - The family he fights for.	7	2	4
72	 Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey?	7	2	4
73	 He's a fisherman's son that grew up near Lannisport.	7	2	4
74	 He probably never held a spear	7	2	4
75	 before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago.	7	2	4
76	 I have no hatred for the lad.	7	2	4
77	 That should help his foot grow back.	7	2	4
78	 You'd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed.	8	2	4
79	 I understand. The country would be at peace	8	2	4
80	 and life would be just under the righteous hand	8	2	4
81	 of good King Joffrey.	8	2	4
82	 - You're going to kill Joffrey? - If the Gods give me strength.	8	2	4
83	 - And then what? - I don't know.	8	2	4
84	 We'll go back to Winterfell.	8	2	4
85	 I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.	8	2	4
86	 So who will?	8	2	4
87	 I don't know.	8	2	4
88	 You're fighting to overthrow a king,	8	2	4
89	 and yet you have no plan for what comes after?	8	2	4
90	 First we have to win the war.	8	2	4
91	 You never told me where you're from.	8	2	4
92	 - Volantis. - Volantis?	8	2	4
93	 You're far from home.	8	2	4
94	 The boy was lucky you were here.	8	2	4
95	 He was unlucky that you were.	8	2	4
96	 You're here to answer for your brother's latest treasons.	9	2	4
97	 Your Grace,	9	2	4
98	 whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part.	9	2	4
99	 You know that. I beg you--	9	2	4
100	 Ser Lancel, tell her of this outrage.	9	2	4
101	 Using some vile sorcery,	9	2	4
102	 your brother fell on Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves.	9	2	4
103	 Thousands of good men were butchered.	9	2	4
104	 After the slaughter, the northmen feasted on	9	2	4
105	 the flesh of the slain.	9	2	4
106	 Killing you would send your brother a message.	9	2	4
107	 But my mother insists on keeping you alive.	9	2	4
108	 Stand.	9	2	4
109	 So we'll have to send your brother	9	2	4
110	 a message some other way.	9	2	4
111	 Meryn.	9	2	4
112	 Leave her face.	10	2	4
113	 I like her pretty.	10	2	4
114	 Meryn, My Lady is overdressed.	10	2	4
115	 Unburden her.	10	2	4
116	 If you want Robb Stark to hear us,	10	2	4
117	 we're going to have to speak louder.	10	2	4
118	 What is the meaning of this?	10	2	4
119	 What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?	10	2	4
120	 The kind who serves his king, Imp.	10	2	4
121	 Careful, now. We don't want	10	2	4
122	 to get blood all over your pretty white cloak.	10	2	4
123	 Someone get the girl something to cover herself with.	10	2	4
124	 She is to be your queen.	11	2	4
125	 Have you no regard for her honor?	11	2	4
126	 - I'm punishing her. - For what crimes?	11	2	4
127	 She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit.	11	2	4
128	 You can't talk to me like that. The king can do as he likes!	11	2	4
129	 The Mad King did as he liked.	11	2	4
130	 Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?	11	2	4
131	 No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard.	11	2	4
132	 I'm not threatening the King, Ser.	11	2	4
133	 I am educating my nephew.	11	2	4
134	 Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him.	11	2	4
135	 That was a threat. See the difference?	11	2	4
136	 I apologize for my nephew's behavior.	12	2	4
137	 Tell me the truth.	12	2	4
138	 Do you want an end to this engagement?	12	2	4
139	 I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love.	12	2	4
140	 Lady Stark, you may survive us yet.	12	2	4
141	 The little king's backed up.	12	2	4
142	 Clogged from balls to brains.	12	2	4
143	 You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?	12	2	4
144	 There's no cure for being a cunt.	12	2	4
145	 But the boy's at that age.	12	2	4
146	 And he's got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies.	12	2	4
147	 Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.	12	2	4
148	 What are you doing here, dog?	13	2	4
149	 Your uncle left your nameday present	13	2	4
150	 and asked me to see that you got it.	13	2	4
151	 And?	13	2	4
152	 What is it?	13	2	4
153	 Look inside, Your Grace.	13	2	4
154	 Your Grace.	13	2	4
155	 - Happy nameday, Your Grace. - My nameday has passed.	13	2	4
156	 We won't tell if you won't.	13	2	4
157	 No.	13	2	4
158	 Her.	13	2	4
159	 Touch her.	13	2	4
160	 Could you hit her?	14	2	4
161	 My uncle sent you?	14	2	4
162	 Yes, Your Grace.	14	2	4
163	 He chose us himself.	14	2	4
164	 Hmm.	14	2	4
165	 Use this.	14	2	4
166	 Harder.	15	2	4
167	 I said harder.	15	2	4
168	 He'd want me to get his money's worth.	15	2	4
169	 Your Grace, too much pain will spoil the pleasure.	16	2	4
170	 Please, please,	16	2	4
171	 please, Your Grace.	16	2	4
172	 Your Grace, if your uncle finds out--	16	2	4
173	 Oh, I want him to find out.	16	2	4
174	 You will bring her to his chambers when you're finished	16	2	4
175	 and show him what you've done.	16	2	4
176	 Or the same thing will happen to you.	16	2	4
177	 Begin.	17	2	4
178	 Harder!	17	2	4
179	 Well, if it isn't my favorite whoremonger.	17	2	4
180	 Pray I haven't kept you waiting long.	17	2	4
181	 Your Grace.	17	2	4
182	 Now you do the Lannisters' bidding, is that it?	17	2	4
183	 Tell me, was my brother's body even cold	17	2	4
184	 before you secured your newest patron?	17	2	4
185	 I'm a practical man.	18	2	4
186	 Just not a loyal one.	18	2	4
187	 And who would you have me be loyal to?	18	2	4
188	 Your brother's corpse?	18	2	4
189	 I don't like you, Lord Baelish.	18	2	4
190	 I don't like your face.	18	2	4
191	 I don't like the words that come oozing out of your mouth.	18	2	4
192	 I don't want you in my tent one minute more than necessary.	18	2	4
193	 So tell me, why are you here?	18	2	4
194	 You can trust Brienne.	18	2	4
195	 Her loyalty comes without charge.	18	2	4
196	 You still have many friends at court, Your Grace,	18	2	4
197	 many who believe Ned Stark erred	18	2	4
198	 by not supporting your claim.	18	2	4
199	 Now I understand.	18	2	4
200	 You know I have the numbers.	18	2	4
201	 You know I'm marching on King's Landing.	18	2	4
202	 When I take the throne, you hope to retain your position.	19	2	4
203	 And your head.	19	2	4
204	 I would give priority to my head.	19	2	4
205	 I understand that you don't like me,	19	2	4
206	 and while that saddens me greatly,	19	2	4
207	 I did not come here today seeking your affection.	19	2	4
208	 When you march on King's Landing,	19	2	4
209	 you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or...	19	2	4
210	 open gates.	19	2	4
211	 Your Grace.	19	2	4
212	 Lord Baelish.	19	2	4
213	 All of these tents look the same to me.	20	2	4
214	 - Would you be so kind-- - It would be my pleasure.	20	2	4
215	 It took me weeks to learn way around the camp.	20	2	4
216	 Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress.	20	2	4
217	 And the moment I learn which tent is mine,	20	2	4
218	 we're on the move again.	20	2	4
219	 Your tent?	20	2	4
220	 Not our tent?	20	2	4
221	 The King snores, perhaps?	20	2	4
222	 Or simply prefers solitude?	20	2	4
223	 Pressures of command, no doubt.	20	2	4
224	 Four kings vying for the throne.	20	2	4
225	 I am not tutored in warfare,	20	2	4
226	 but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers.	20	2	4
227	 If war were arithmetic,	20	2	4
228	 the mathematicians would rule the world.	20	2	4
229	 But I did notice your brother entering His Grace's tent the just now.	20	2	4
230	 The place of a Kingsguard is by the King's side.	20	2	4
231	 And on the night of the your wedding,	20	2	4
232	 who was by the King's side then?	20	2	4
233	 You seem quite interested in our marriage.	21	2	4
234	 Your marriage is quite interesting...	21	2	4
235	 Not only to me, but to the realm.	21	2	4
236	 The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest,	21	2	4
237	 if nothing else.	21	2	4
238	 You've never married, have you?	21	2	4
239	 I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly.	21	2	4
240	 That is sad.	21	2	4
241	 Though perhaps it's for the best.	21	2	4
242	 The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you,	21	2	4
243	 so allow me to explain.	21	2	4
244	 My husband is my King, and my King is my husband.	21	2	4
245	 Here is your tent, Lord Baelish. Good night.	21	2	4
246	 What do you know of this place?	22	2	4
247	 Only that the desert around their walls	22	2	4
248	 is called the Garden of Bones.	22	2	4
249	 Every time the Qartheen shut their gates on a traveler,	22	2	4
250	 the garden grows.	23	2	4
251	 - Go on! - You, keep moving!	23	2	4
252	 Bring her about!	23	2	4
253	 What kind of fire melts stone?	23	2	4
254	 Dragon fire.	23	2	4
255	 There's dragons here?	23	2	4
256	 No, all the dragons are dead.	23	2	4
257	 What's that smell?	23	2	4
258	 Dead people.	23	2	4
259	 Move.	23	2	4
260	 Please, please, no, no!	24	2	4
261	 No.	24	2	4
262	 He's dead.	24	2	4
263	 He was my son.	24	2	4
264	 My sister was three days ago.	24	2	4
265	 My husband, the day before that.	24	2	4
266	 They take someone every day?	24	2	4
267	 Does anyone live?	24	2	4
268	 Joffrey.	25	2	4
269	 Cersei.	25	2	4
270	 Ilyn Payne.	25	2	4
271	 The Hound.	25	2	4
272	 Joffrey.	25	2	4
273	 Cersei.	25	2	4
274	 Ilyn Payne.	25	2	4
275	 The Hound.	25	2	4
276	 Joffrey. Cersei.	25	2	4
277	 Ilyn Payne. The Hound.	25	2	4
278	 How dare you?	25	2	4
279	 You may have heard false reports.	25	2	4
280	 - You betrayed Ned. - Betrayed?	26	2	4
281	 I wanted him to serve as Protector of the Realm.	26	2	4
282	 I begged him to seize the moment.	26	2	4
283	 I trusted you. My husband trusted you.	26	2	4
284	 And you repaid our faith with treachery.	26	2	4
285	 - No, My Lady. - Get out!	26	2	4
286	 Cat, I've--	26	2	4
287	 I've loved you since I was a boy.	26	2	4
288	 It seems to me that fate has given us this chance--	26	2	4
289	 Have you lost your mind? Get out!	26	2	4
290	 Do you want to see your girls again?	26	2	4
291	 Sansa, more beautiful than ever.	26	2	4
292	 And Arya, just as wild as ever.	26	2	4
293	 You have Arya, too?	27	2	4
294	 Both girls are healthy and safe...	27	2	4
295	 for now.	27	2	4
296	 But you know the Queen and you know Joffrey.	27	2	4
297	 I fear for their longevity	27	2	4
298	 if they remain in the capital.	27	2	4
299	 What do you want?	27	2	4
300	 The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer.	27	2	4
301	 Of course they will.	27	2	4
302	 Jaime Lannister for two girls?	27	2	4
303	 Robb will never agree to those terms.	28	2	4
304	 I'm not bringing these terms to him.	28	2	4
305	 I'm bringing them to you.	28	2	4
306	 You think I'd keep secrets from my son?	28	2	4
307	 Robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle,	28	2	4
308	 but he's not a mother.	28	2	4
309	 Consider it, Cat.	28	2	4
310	 You may not get another chance.	28	2	4
311	 - I've brought you a gift. - I don't want your gifts.	28	2	4
312	 A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill.	28	2	4
313	 He wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners	28	2	4
314	 is offered in good faith.	28	2	4
315	 Good faith?	28	2	4
316	 What's this?	28	2	4
317	 Your husband was an honorable man.	29	2	4
318	 He should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath Winterfell.	29	2	4
319	 - You may not believe-- - Get out.	29	2	4
320	 Get up, you dogs!	30	2	4
321	 That's him, the one who picks.	30	2	4
322	 The Mountain.	30	2	4
323	 What are you doing?	30	2	4
324	 He told me he stares at him every day.	30	2	4
325	 That's why he doesn't get picked.	30	2	4
326	 You.	31	2	4
327	 Move, boy!	31	2	4
328	 Move!	31	2	4
329	 Is there gold and silver in the village?	31	2	4
330	 - I don't know. - Gems?	31	2	4
331	 I didn't see any.	32	2	4
332	 - Where is the Brotherhood? - I don't know.	32	2	4
333	 - Where is the Brotherhood? - I don't know. Please.	32	2	4
334	 - Where is the Brotherhood? - I don't know.	32	2	4
335	 Which of the villagers aided them?	32	2	4
336	 - I don't know. - Who?	32	2	4
337	 I--	32	2	4
338	 - Who? - I never saw.	32	2	4
339	 - Who? - I never saw.	32	2	4
340	 Please. Please, stop. Please, it's starting to--	32	2	4
341	 - Who? - I didn't see anyone help him.	32	2	4
342	 Take it off! Take it off!	33	2	4
343	 - Who helped him? - Ganes the butcher	33	2	4
344	 - and his son. - That's better.	33	2	4
345	 - You've been very helpful. - No, stop, please!	33	2	4
346	 What are you doing? Please, stop!	33	2	4
347	 Please, stop! No! No!	33	2	4
348	 I told you everything! No!	33	2	4
349	 No!	33	2	4
350	 Joffrey.	33	2	4
351	 Cersei.	33	2	4
352	 Ilyn Payne. The Hound.	33	2	4
353	 Please, Polliver. Some food.	33	2	4
354	 Just a crust of bread.	33	2	4
355	 Polliver.	33	2	4
356	 The Mountain.	33	2	4
357	 Lady Stark, I had not thought to find you in the Stormlands.	34	2	4
358	 I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis.	34	2	4
359	 - Can that truly be you? - Who else might it be?	34	2	4
360	 When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure.	34	2	4
361	 - Whose banner is that? - My own.	34	2	4
362	 I suppose if we used the same one,	34	2	4
363	 the battle would be terribly confusing.	34	2	4
364	 Why is your stag on fire?	34	2	4
365	 The King has taken for his sigil	34	2	4
366	 the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.	34	2	4
367	 Ah, you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about.	34	2	4
368	 Mm, brother,	34	2	4
369	 now I understand why you found religion in your old age.	34	2	4
370	 Watch yourself, Renly.	34	2	4
371	 No, no, I'm relieved.	34	2	4
372	 I never really believed you're a fanatic.	35	2	4
373	 Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes,	35	2	4
374	 but not a godly man.	35	2	4
375	 You should kneel he's the Lord's chosen,	35	2	4
376	 born amidst salt and smoke.	35	2	4
377	 Born amidst salt and smoke?	35	2	4
378	 Is he a ham?	35	2	4
379	 That's twice I've warned you.	35	2	4
380	 Listen to yourselves.	35	2	4
381	 If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together	35	2	4
382	 and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered	35	2	4
383	 that you were brothers.	35	2	4
384	 It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark.	35	2	4
385	 Your husband was a supporter of my claim.	35	2	4
386	 Lord Eddard's integrity cost him his head.	35	2	4
387	 And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me.	35	2	4
388	 We share a common enemy.	35	2	4
389	 The Iron Throne is mine by right.	35	2	4
390	 All those that deny that are my foes.	35	2	4
391	 The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall.	35	2	4
392	 Old men deny it with their death rattle	36	2	4
393	 and unborn children deny it in their mother's wombs.	36	2	4
394	 No one wants you for their King.	36	2	4
395	 You never wanted any friends, brother.	36	2	4
396	 But a man without friends is a man without power.	36	2	4
397	 For the sake of the mother who bore us,	36	2	4
398	 I will give you this one night to reconsider.	36	2	4
399	 Strike your banners,	36	2	4
400	 come to me before dawn,	36	2	4
401	 and I will grant you your old seat in the council.	36	2	4
402	 I'll even name you my heir	36	2	4
403	 until a son is born to me.	36	2	4
404	 Otherwise I shall destroy you.	36	2	4
405	 Look across those fields, brother.	36	2	4
406	 Can you see all those banners?	36	2	4
407	 You think a few bolts of cloth will make you King?	36	2	4
408	 No.	37	2	4
409	 The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me King.	37	2	4
410	 We shall see, Renly.	37	2	4
411	 Come the dawn, we shall see.	37	2	4
412	 Look to your sins, Lord Renly.	37	2	4
413	 The night is dark and full of terrors.	37	2	4
414	 Would you believe I loved him once?	37	2	4
415	 I thought we were welcome.	37	2	4
416	 If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city,	37	2	4
417	 you might do the same, Khaleesi.	37	2	4
418	 Horde?	38	2	4
419	 My name is Daenerys--	38	2	4
420	 Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen.	38	2	4
421	 You know me, My Lord?	38	2	4
422	 Only by reputation, Khaleesi.	38	2	4
423	 And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant.	38	2	4
424	 They call you the Mother of Dragons.	38	2	4
425	 And what should I call you?	38	2	4
426	 Oh, my name is quite long	38	2	4
427	 and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce.	38	2	4
428	 I am simply a trader of spices.	38	2	4
429	 But we are the Thirteen,	38	2	4
430	 charged with the governance and protection of Qarth,	39	2	4
431	 the greatest city that ever was or will be.	39	2	4
432	 The beauty of Quarth is legendary--	39	2	4
433	 Qarth.	39	2	4
434	 Qarth.	39	2	4
435	 Might we see the dragons?	39	2	4
436	 My friend,	39	2	4
437	 we have travelled very far.	39	2	4
438	 We have no food, no water.	39	2	4
439	 Once I see my people fed, I would be honored--	39	2	4
440	 Forgive me, Mother of Dragons,	39	2	4
441	 but no man alive has seen a living dragon.	39	2	4
442	 Some of my more skeptical friends	39	2	4
443	 refuse to believe your children	39	2	4
444	 even exist.	39	2	4
445	 All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves.	39	2	4
446	 I am not a liar.	40	2	4
447	 Oh, I don't think you are.	40	2	4
448	 But as I've never met you before,	40	2	4
449	 my opinion on the matter is of limited value.	40	2	4
450	 Where I come from,	40	2	4
451	 guests are treated with respect,	40	2	4
452	 not insulted at the gates.	40	2	4
453	 Then perhaps you should return to where you come from.	40	2	4
454	 We wish you well.	40	2	4
455	 What are you doing?	40	2	4
456	 You promised to receive me.	40	2	4
457	 We have received you.	40	2	4
458	 Here we are, and here you are.	40	2	4
459	 If you do not let us in, all of us will die.	40	2	4
460	 Which we shall deeply regret.	40	2	4
461	 But Qarth did not become	40	2	4
462	 the greatest city that ever was or will be	40	2	4
463	 by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.	40	2	4
464	 Khaleesi, please be careful.	41	2	4
465	 Thirteen!	41	2	4
466	 When my dragons are grown,	41	2	4
467	 we will take back what was stolen from me	41	2	4
468	 and destroy those who have wronged me.	41	2	4
469	 We will lay waste to armies	41	2	4
470	 and burn cities to the ground.	41	2	4
471	 Turn us away and we will burn you first.	41	2	4
472	 Ah.	41	2	4
473	 You are a true Targaryen.	41	2	4
474	 Only, as you said a moment ago,	41	2	4
475	 if we don't let you into the city,	41	2	4
476	 you will all die. And so...	41	2	4
477	 Retreating in fear from a little girl	41	2	4
478	 is unbecoming of the greatest city	41	2	4
479	 that ever was or will be.	41	2	4
480	 The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos.	42	2	4
481	 The Thirteen have spoken.	42	2	4
482	 I am one of the Thirteen	42	2	4
483	 and I am still speaking.	42	2	4
484	 The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground	42	2	4
485	 and you would invite her in for a cup of wine?	42	2	4
486	 She is the Mother of Dragons.	42	2	4
487	 Do you expect her to watch her people starve	42	2	4
488	 without breathing fire?	42	2	4
489	 I believe we can allow a few Dothraki	42	2	4
490	 through our gates without dooming our city.	42	2	4
491	 After all, here I am,	42	2	4
492	 a savage from the Summer Isles,	42	2	4
493	 and Qarth still stands.	42	2	4
494	 Our decision is final.	42	2	4
495	 Very well.	42	2	4
496	 I invoke Soumai.	42	2	4
497	 I will vouch for her, her people,	43	2	4
498	 and her dragons in accordance with the law.	43	2	4
499	 Be it on your head.	43	2	4
500	 Welcome to Qarth, My Lady.	43	2	4
501	 You.	44	2	4
502	 Is there gold or silver in the village?	44	2	4
503	 - I'm not from the village. - Where is the Brotherhood?	44	2	4
504	 I don't know what that is.	44	2	4
505	 You two, take Lord Lannister's things to his quarters.	45	2	4
506	 What's this?	45	2	4
507	 We weren't expecting you till tomorrow, Lord Tywin.	45	2	4
508	 Evidently not.	45	2	4
509	 Why are these prisoners not in their cells?	45	2	4
510	 Cells are overflowing, My Lord.	45	2	4
511	 This lot won't be here long.	45	2	4
512	 Don't need no permanent place.	45	2	4
513	 After we interrogate 'em, we usually just...	45	2	4
514	 Are we so well-manned that we can afford to discard	45	2	4
515	 able young bodies and skilled laborers?	45	2	4
516	 You, do you have a trade?	46	2	4
517	 Smith, My Lord.	46	2	4
518	 What are you looking at? Kneel!	46	2	4
519	 Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy.	46	2	4
520	 He'll do no such thing.	46	2	4
521	 This one's a girl, you idiot,	46	2	4
522	 dressed as a boy.	46	2	4
523	 - Why? - Safer to travel, My Lord.	46	2	4
524	 Smart.	46	2	4
525	 More than I can say for this lot.	46	2	4
526	 Get these prisoners to work.	46	2	4
527	 Bring the girl.	46	2	4
528	 I need a new cupbearer.	46	2	4
529	 My Lord.	46	2	4
530	 Your visits are too few, cousin.	46	2	4
531	 Her Grace, the Queen Regent,	47	2	4
532	 commands you to release Grand Maester Pycelle.	47	2	4
533	 - Here's your warrant. - So it is.	47	2	4
534	 Will you take a cup with me?	47	2	4
535	 I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.	47	2	4
536	 I am here at Her Grace's behest,	47	2	4
537	 not to drink with you, Imp.	47	2	4
538	 If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle,	47	2	4
539	 I would have thought she'd come herself.	47	2	4
540	 Instead she sends you.	47	2	4
541	 What am I to make of that?	47	2	4
542	 I don't care what you make of it,	47	2	4
543	 so long as you release your prisoner immediately.	47	2	4
544	 And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?	47	2	4
545	 As I said several times.	47	2	4
546	 And you've waited this long to deliver the information?	47	2	4
547	 When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry	47	2	4
548	 it out without delay.	47	2	4
549	 Cersei must have great trust in you,	47	2	4
550	 allowing you into her chamber	47	2	4
551	 during the hour of the wolf.	48	2	4
552	 The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities.	48	2	4
553	 She often works from dusk till dawn.	48	2	4
554	 She must be very glad to have you helping her	48	2	4
555	 from dusk till dawn.	48	2	4
556	 Ah, lavender oil.	48	2	4
557	 She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl.	48	2	4
558	 I am a knight!	48	2	4
559	 An anointed knight, yes.	48	2	4
560	 Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted	48	2	4
561	 before or after she took you into her bed?	48	2	4
562	 What? Nothing to say?	48	2	4
563	 No more warnings for me, Ser?	48	2	4
564	 You will withdraw these filthy accusations.	48	2	4
565	 Have you ever given any thought	48	2	4
566	 to what King Joffrey will have to say	48	2	4
567	 when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?	48	2	4
568	 It's not my fault!	48	2	4
569	 Did she take you against your will?	49	2	4
570	 Can you not defend yourself, knight?	49	2	4
571	 Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the King's squire,	49	2	4
572	 he told me to obey her in everything.	49	2	4
573	 Did he tell you to fuck her, too?	49	2	4
574	 I only meant I did as I was bid.	49	2	4
575	 Hated every moment of it,	49	2	4
576	 is that what you'll have me believe?	49	2	4
577	 A high place in court, a knighthood,	49	2	4
578	 my sister's legs spreading open for you at night.	49	2	4
579	 Oh, yes, it must have been terrible.	49	2	4
580	 Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this.	49	2	4
581	 Mercy! Mercy, My Lord! I beg you.	49	2	4
582	 Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.	49	2	4
583	 My Lord, it was your sister's bidding--	49	2	4
584	 the Queen.	49	2	4
585	 I'll leave the city at once, I swear.	49	2	4
586	 - No, I think not. - My Lord?	49	2	4
587	 You heard me.	49	2	4
588	 My father told you to obey my sister.	49	2	4
589	 Obey her.	49	2	4
590	 Stay close to her side. Keep her trust.	49	2	4
591	 Pleasure her whenever she requires.	50	2	4
592	 No one ever need know	50	2	4
593	 as long as you keep faith with me.	50	2	4
594	 I want to know what Cersei is doing,	50	2	4
595	 where she goes, who she sees,	50	2	4
596	 what they talk of-- everything.	50	2	4
597	 And you will tell me.	50	2	4
598	 Yes, My Lord, I will.	50	2	4
599	 I swear it, as you command.	50	2	4
600	 Oh, rise, rise.	50	2	4
601	 Let us drink to our understanding.	50	2	4
602	 Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well.	50	2	4
603	 Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman.	50	2	4
604	 And it's all for the good of the realm.	50	2	4
605	 Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness,	50	2	4
606	 that I want no more conflict between us	50	2	4
607	 and that henceforth	50	2	4
608	 I shall do nothing without her consent.	50	2	4
609	 But her demands.	50	2	4
610	 Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.	50	2	4
611	 - You will? - Yes, I'll release him in the morning.	51	2	4
612	 Cersei can keep him as a pet if she wants,	51	2	4
613	 but I will not have him on the council.	51	2	4
614	 I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head,	51	2	4
615	 but that would not, strictly speaking, be true.	51	2	4
616	 Stay within one table length.	51	2	4
617	 Your Grace.	51	2	4
618	 Do your knucklebones bring you luck?	51	2	4
619	 Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace.	51	2	4
620	 And it's four less fingernails to clean.	51	2	4
621	 - Fewer. - Pardon?	52	2	4
622	 Four fewer fingernails to clean.	52	2	4
623	 Never understood why you had to wear them.	52	2	4
624	 It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now.	52	2	4
625	 It reminds me of your justice.	52	2	4
626	 It was an honest punishment	52	2	4
627	 and you were good with the cleaver.	52	2	4
628	 You were a hero and a smuggler.	52	2	4
629	 A good act does not wash out the bad,	52	2	4
630	 nor a bad the good.	52	2	4
631	 A lesson I've tried to teach my son.	52	2	4
632	 - Does he listen? - To me?	52	2	4
633	 Gods, no.	52	2	4
634	 But if your red woman told him to leap from the crow's nest--	52	2	4
635	 She has a name.	52	2	4
636	 I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.	52	2	4
637	 I've lived within the law for 17--	52	2	4
638	 I want you to be a smuggler this time.	52	2	4
639	 Any shore, any night.	53	2	4
640	 What am I bringing ashore?	53	2	4
641	 The red woman.	53	2	4
642	 No one must know what you do	53	2	4
643	 and we'll not speak of this again.	53	2	4
644	 I am true to Your Grace and always will be,	53	2	4
645	 but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways.	53	2	4
646	 Cleaner ways don't win wars.	53	2	4
647	 Are you afraid, Onion Knight?	54	2	4
648	 Someone once told me	54	2	4
649	 the night is dark and full of terrors.	54	2	4
650	 You've carried more unpleasant cargo in your time.	54	2	4
651	 Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?	54	2	4
652	 I'd say my parts are mixed, My Lady--	54	2	4
653	 good and bad.	54	2	4
654	 If half an onion is black with rot,	54	2	4
655	 it's a rotten onion.	54	2	4
656	 A man is good or he is evil.	54	2	4
657	 - And which are you? - Oh, good.	54	2	4
658	 I'm a knight myself of sorts,	54	2	4
659	 a champion of light and life.	54	2	4
660	 Well, that must be very nice for you.	54	2	4
661	 - Do you love your wife? - I do.	55	2	4
662	 Yet you have known other women.	55	2	4
663	 Don't talk about my wife.	55	2	4
664	 I'm not. I'm talking about other women.	55	2	4
665	 Like me, Ser Davos.	55	2	4
666	 You want me.	55	2	4
667	 You want to see what's beneath this robe.	55	2	4
668	 And you will.	55	2	4
669	 Strange that this Lord of Light	55	2	4
670	 asks you to work in the shadows.	55	2	4
671	 Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos.	55	2	4
672	 They are servants of light,	55	2	4
673	 the children of fire.	56	2	4
674	 And the brighter the flame, the darker they are.	56	2	4
675	 These weren't here before. They've barred the passage.	56	2	4
676	 They can't bar our passage.	56	2	4
677	 Gods protect us.	56	2	4
678	 There's only one God, Ser Davos,	56	2	4
679	 and he only protects those who serve him.	56	2	4

17	 Too bad you got a hangnail for a cock.	3	4	8
18	 (laughs)	3	4	8
19	 First time I saw you with your breeches down,	3	4	8
20	 I thought you were a eunuch.	3	4	8
21	  (laughing)  Youve seen it, girls.	3	4	8
22	 Like a baby snail peeking out of his shell.	3	4	8
23	 (laughs)	3	4	8
24	 Your baby was crying this morning.	3	4	8
25	 Woke me up.	3	4	8
26	 You hear me?	4	4	8
27	 Yes.	4	4	8
28	 Well, got anything to say?	4	4	8
29	 Im sorry he woke you up.	4	4	8
30	 (chuckles) I dont care if youre sorry.	4	4	8
31	 Keep that baby quiet	4	4	8
32	 or I will.	4	4	8
33	 Dont you ever touch him.	4	4	8
34	 (chuckles)	4	4	8
35	 Little wildling bitch.	4	4	8
36	 You should have stayed with your own kind.	4	4	8
37	 (owl hoots)	4	4	8
38	 You listening to me?	4	4	8
39	  Shut your mouth.  What?	4	4	8
40	 (owl hoots)	4	4	8

55	 (blood pouring)	6	4	8
56	 (screaming continues)	6	4	8
57	 I should never have left her there.	6	4	8
58	  You couldnt have known.  Of course I couldve known.	6	4	8
59	 Theyve been raiding the villages close by.	6	4	8
60	 And we just cower in here while they slaughter our brothers.	6	4	8
61	 Our brothers had orders to stay at Castle Black.	6	4	8
62	 So its all right, then? Black Jack and Kegs	7	4	8
63	 and Mully chopped to pieces cause they broke the rules?	7	4	8
64	 Dolorous    I didnt say it was all right.	7	4	8
65	 Im saying they shouldnt have been there.	7	4	8
66	 Were pledged to guard the realms of men.	7	4	8
67	 Shes dead because of me.	7	4	8
68	 We cant even guard Moles Town.	7	4	8
69	 We cant go after them. You know that.	7	4	8
70	 Its what they want.	7	4	8
71	 And little Sam.	7	4	8
72	 As if I cut their thats self.	7	4	8
73	 Maybe she managed to hide herself.	7	4	8
74	 I thought all of you was dead.	7	4	8
75	 You went north with Mormont and no one came back.	7	4	8
76	 Not for ages.	7	4	8
77	 But then you did.	7	4	8
78	 She survived Craster	7	4	8
79	 and he was the worst shit Ive ever met.	7	4	8
80	 She survived the long march to the Wall.	7	4	8
81	 She survived a white walker, for fucks sake.	7	4	8
82	 She might have got out.	7	4	8
83	 She might have.	7	4	8
84	 If they hit Moles Town,	8	4	8
85	 then were next.	8	4	8
86	 Mance and his army must be close.	8	4	8
87	   100,000 of them.	8	4	8
88	 And theres what, 105 of us left?	8	4	8
89	 You counting Black Jack, Kegs, and Mully?	8	4	8
90	 102.	8	4	8
91	 How do 102 men stop 100,000?	8	4	8
92	 Whoever dies last, be a good lad	8	4	8
93	 and burn the rest of us.	8	4	8
94	 Once Im done with this world,	8	4	8
95	 I dont want to come back.	8	4	8
96	    You think he was spying on you?	9	4	8
97	   No, not spying.	9	4	8
98	    The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous	9	4	8
99	 taking shame in the naked body.	10	4	8
100	 They make love under the stars for the whole khalasar to see.	10	4	8
101	 Yes, Your Grace.	10	4	8
102	 But you are not Dothraki.	10	4	8
103	 No.	10	4	8
104	 Well, I dont see why it matters.	10	4	8
105	 Grey Worm isnt interested.	10	4	8
106	 None of the Unsullied care whats under our clothes.	10	4	8
107	 He was interested.	10	4	8
108	 What?	10	4	8
109	 I believe he was interested.	10	4	8
110	 When the slavers castrate the boys,	10	4	8
111	 do they take all of it?	10	4	8
112	 All of it?	10	4	8
113	 The	10	4	8
114	 the pillar and the stones.	10	4	8
115	 I dont know, Your Grace.	10	4	8
116	 Havent you ever wondered?	10	4	8
117	 Yes, Your Grace.	11	4	8
118	 Grey   Missandei.	11	4	8
119	 	11	4	8
120	 	11	4	8
121	 	11	4	8
122	 	11	4	8
123	 The lessons you give I in common tongue	11	4	8
124	 these are precious to I.	11	4	8
125	  To me.  To me.	11	4	8
126	 I dont remember teaching you the word precious.	12	4	8
127	 Jorah the Andal, he teaches I	12	4	8
128	 he teaches me this word.	12	4	8
129	 Do you remember the name you were given at birth?	12	4	8
130	 I remember nothing.	12	4	8
131	 Only Unsullied.	12	4	8
132	 When they cut you,	12	4	8
133	 do you remember that?	12	4	8
134	 Im sorry.	12	4	8
135	 Im sorry they did that to you.	12	4	8
136	 Why? Why sorry?	12	4	8
137	 Its a terrible thing to do to a boy.	12	4	8
138	 If the masters never cut me,	12	4	8
139	 I never am Unsullied.	12	4	8
140	 I never stand in the Plaza of Pride	12	4	8
141	 when Daenerys Stormborn to kill the masters.	12	4	8
142	 I never am chosen to lead the Unsullied.	13	4	8
143	 I never meet Missandei	13	4	8
144	 from the island of Naath.	13	4	8
145	 I am sorry I	13	4	8
146	 for today.	13	4	8
147	 I am sorry.	13	4	8
148	 	13	4	8
149	 	13	4	8
150	 	14	4	8
151	 (horses whinny)	14	4	8
152	 Kraken. Mmm.	14	4	8
153	 Strong as long as theyre in the sea.	14	4	8
154	 When you take them out of the water,	14	4	8
155	 no bones.	14	4	8
156	 They collapse under their proud weight	14	4	8
157	 and slump into a heap of nothing.	14	4	8
158	 Youd think they know that.	14	4	8
159	 Unfortunately, theyre not very bright.	14	4	8
160	 What do you tell them?	14	4	8
161	 Im Theon Greyjoy,	14	4	8
162	 son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands.	14	4	8
163	  And what are you really?  Im Reek.	15	4	8
164	 Are you sure?	15	4	8
165	 You do look very much like a lord.	15	4	8
166	 Formidable, proud.	15	4	8
167	 Im Reek.	15	4	8
168	 Until when?	15	4	8
169	 Always.	15	4	8
170	  Forever.  Thats right.	15	4	8
171	 Until youre rotting in the ground.	15	4	8
172	 Remember what you are and what youre not.	15	4	8
173	 Bring me Moat Cailin.	15	4	8
174	 (cawing)	15	4	8
175	 No closer.	16	4	8
176	 Who are you?	16	4	8
177	 (grunts)	16	4	8
178	 (men coughing)	16	4	8
179	 (flies buzzing)	16	4	8
180	 Im Kenning,	17	4	8
181	 commander of this garrison.	17	4	8
182	 And you say youre Theon Greyjoy?	17	4	8
183	 Yes.	17	4	8
184	 And why should I believe that?	17	4	8
185	 I was born on Pyke to Balon Greyjoy.	17	4	8
186	 His third and last living son.	17	4	8
187	 I am your prince.	17	4	8
188	 I swear it by the Drowned God.	17	4	8
189	 What is dead may never die.	17	4	8
190	   What is dead may never die.	17	4	8
191	 And if you were my prince,	17	4	8
192	 why are you marching with a Bolton army?	17	4	8
193	 Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell.	17	4	8
194	 He sent me to treat with you in good faith	17	4	8
195	 as your fellow ironborn.	17	4	8
196	 And what does Lord Bolton want?	17	4	8
197	 You are fading from sickness,	17	4	8
198	 you are badly outnumbered,	18	4	8
199	 and youre hundreds of miles from the sea.	18	4	8
200	 Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men	18	4	8
201	 and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold.	18	4	8
202	 Do this, and he will be just and fair with you	18	4	8
203	 as he has been with me.	18	4	8
204	 The Boltons will give you safe passage to the Stony Shore.	18	4	8
205	 He wants us to surrender?	18	4	8
206	 My own father, your king,	18	4	8
207	 surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon.	18	4	8
208	 I watched him bend the knee.	18	4	8
209	 There was no shame there.	18	4	8
210	 He fought with honor, as did you.	18	4	8
211	 (groans)	18	4	8
212	 (mutters) No shame. Fought with honor.	18	4	8
213	 Im sorry, I didnt hear.	18	4	8
214	 No shame. Fought with honor.	18	4	8
215	 Only a whipped dog would speak this way.	18	4	8
216	 Or a woman.	19	4	8
217	 Are you a woman, boy?	19	4	8
218	 You dont know	19	4	8
219	 The ironborn will not surrender.	19	4	8
220	 (mumbling) Reek. My name is Reek	19	4	8
221	 You go tell your master that,	19	4	8
222	 Theon Greyjoy,	19	4	8
223	 or whoever the fuck you are.	19	4	8
224	 (quietly) My name is Reek.	19	4	8
225	 What in the hell are you muttering?	19	4	8
226	 Im Reek.	19	4	8
227	 Reek.	19	4	8
228	 If we yield, we live?	19	4	8
229	 Is that what it says on this paper here?	19	4	8
230	 Yes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates.	19	4	8
231	 Youre going home.	19	4	8
232	    You didnt really think Id let them go, did you?	20	4	8
233	 Its fallen out of fashion, flaying.	20	4	8
234	 Sad, but true.	20	4	8
235	 Traditions are important.	20	4	8
236	 Where are we without our history?	20	4	8
237	  Eh?  Yes, my lord.	20	4	8
238	 Will we go home now?	20	4	8
239	 I believe we will.	20	4	8
240	 To our new home.	20	4	8
241	   You have foreign blood, dont you, Baelish?	20	4	8
242	 A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes.	20	4	8
243	 I suppose all of our ancestors	20	4	8
244	 came from somewhere else originally.	20	4	8
245	    Our forebearers settled the Vale	20	4	8
246	 thousands of years ago.	20	4	8
247	 Weve fought off invaders ever since.	20	4	8
248	 The beauty of the Vale is matched only	21	4	8
249	 by the nobility of its great families.	21	4	8
250	 Lady Arryn often told me	21	4	8
251	 that you were her rock, Lord Royce.	21	4	8
252	 She told me nothing about you, Baelish.	21	4	8
253	 But I didnt need to hear from her.	21	4	8
254	 Moneylender. Whoremonger.	21	4	8
255	 Youve been licking Tywin Lannisters boots so long,	21	4	8
256	  its a wonder your tongues not black.  My lord	21	4	8
257	 And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared.	21	4	8
258	 Always been a grubby job.	21	4	8
259	 Why not let a grubby man do it?	21	4	8
260	 But when I heard you were lurking here,	21	4	8
261	 fawning over the Lady Arryn	21	4	8
262	 Lady Arryn invited me.	21	4	8
263	 She and I have been close since childhood.	21	4	8
264	 Yes, we all know how close you were.	21	4	8
265	 Lady Arryns predilections were her own affair.	21	4	8
266	 Her death is our affair.	21	4	8
267	 Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.	21	4	8
268	 She was an odd fish.	21	4	8
269	 Everyone knew that. But suicide?	22	4	8
270	 She adored that boy of hers.	22	4	8
271	 I dont see her abandoning him. Not by choice.	22	4	8
272	   Strange that within days of your arrival,	22	4	8
273	 youve married Lady Arryn and shes fallen through the Moon Door.	22	4	8
274	 She was always prone to melancholy.	22	4	8
275	 My lady wasnt meant for a world as brutal as ours.	22	4	8
276	 We were told there was a witness. A girl.	22	4	8
277	 A niece of yours, I believe.	22	4	8
278	 A girl with no learning and scattered wits.	22	4	8
279	 I assure you, she would be of no help.	22	4	8
280	 Wed like to speak with her.	22	4	8
281	  Let me fetch her.   No need.	22	4	8
282	 We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.	22	4	8
283	 (door closes)	23	4	8
284	 Come closer, child.	23	4	8
285	 You have nothing to fear from us or him.	23	4	8
286	 Lord Baelish here is your uncle?	23	4	8
287	 Your name is Alayne?	23	4	8
288	 Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room.	23	4	8
289	  My lady  I wasnt asking you.	23	4	8
290	  He can stay.  Speak up, girl, youre not a damn kitchen mouse.	23	4	8
291	 Tell us what you saw.	23	4	8
292	 Im sorry, Lord Baelish.	23	4	8
293	 I have to tell the truth.	23	4	8
294	 Ill tell you everything.	23	4	8
295	 Please, Alayne, leave nothing out.	23	4	8
296	 My name is not Alayne.	23	4	8
297	 Its Sansa Stark,	23	4	8
298	 eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark.	23	4	8
299	 Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell.	24	4	8
300	 You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall.	24	4	8
301	 Sansa Stark?	24	4	8
302	 You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?	24	4	8
303	 Lord Baelish has told many lies.	24	4	8
304	 All to protect me.	24	4	8
305	 Since my father was executed,	24	4	8
306	 I have been a hostage in Kings Landing.	24	4	8
307	 A plaything for Joffrey to torture	24	4	8
308	 or Queen Cersei to torment.	24	4	8
309	 They beat me, they humiliated me,	24	4	8
310	 they married me to the Imp.	24	4	8
311	 I had no friends in Kings Landing	24	4	8
312	 except one.	24	4	8
313	 He saved me.	24	4	8
314	 Smuggled me away when he had the chance.	25	4	8
315	 He knew Id be safe here in the Eyrie	25	4	8
316	 with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa.	25	4	8
317	 The Lannisters have friends everywhere.	25	4	8
318	 Even the Vale.	25	4	8
319	 He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name.	25	4	8
320	 Your secret is safe with us, my lady.	25	4	8
321	   Your father grew up right here in these halls.	25	4	8
322	 We hunted together many times.	25	4	8
323	 He was a fine man.	25	4	8
324	 Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa.	25	4	8
325	 You knew her well, my lords, my lady.	25	4	8
326	 You knew she was a troubled woman.	25	4	8
327	 She always loved Lord Baelish.	25	4	8
328	 She told me herself.	25	4	8
329	 From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun,	25	4	8
330	 a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack.	25	4	8
331	 She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn.	26	4	8
332	 She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have.	26	4	8
333	 When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish,	26	4	8
334	 she was so happy.	26	4	8
335	 For a time.	26	4	8
336	 My aunt was a jealous lady.	26	4	8
337	 She was terrified that Lord Baelish	26	4	8
338	 didnt love her anymore.	26	4	8
339	 That he would abandon her for a younger woman.	26	4	8
340	 And then	26	4	8
341	 one day she saw him kiss me.	26	4	8
342	 Lady Sansa.	26	4	8
343	 It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more.	26	4	8
344	 Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage.	26	4	8
345	 Hes always been so kind to me.	26	4	8
346	 I was so happy to be here, to be free.	26	4	8
347	 All because of him.	26	4	8
348	 But my aunt turned on me.	27	4	8
349	 She cursed me. Called me a whore.	27	4	8
350	 Promised to throw me through the Moon Door.	27	4	8
351	 When Lord Baelish tried to calm her,	27	4	8
352	 she struck him.	27	4	8
353	 She said she didnt want to live anymore.	27	4	8
354	 She stood on the edge of that Moon Door.	27	4	8
355	 He tried to reason with her.	27	4	8
356	 Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved,	27	4	8
357	 but she stepped through those doors and she was	27	4	8
358	 Shh.	27	4	8
359	 Shh, its not your fault, sweet girl.	27	4	8
360	 Its not your fault.	27	4	8
361	 You could see it in the way she raised that boy.	28	4	8
362	 Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.	28	4	8
363	 Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.	28	4	8
364	 Apologies, my lady.	28	4	8
365	 And to you as well, Baelish.	28	4	8
366	 We treated you a bit harshly.	28	4	8
367	 You want justice, Lord Royce.	28	4	8
368	 I can hardly complain about that.	28	4	8
369	 I want the same.	28	4	8
370	 Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?	28	4	8
371	 For Lysa, no. But for her son?	28	4	8
372	 Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale	28	4	8
373	 rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon.	28	4	8
374	 They fought together to overcome the Mad King.	28	4	8
375	 And since then, Arryn and Royce,	28	4	8
376	 Corbray, Waynwood,	28	4	8
377	 all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner.	28	4	8
378	 A timid boy at a tavern brawl.	28	4	8
379	 Are you questioning our courage?	28	4	8
380	 I want to know which side youre on.	29	4	8
381	 Do you support the Lannisters,	29	4	8
382	 the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?	29	4	8
383	 Of course we dont support the damn Lannisters.	29	4	8
384	 No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused.	29	4	8
385	 By staying out of the fray, youve allowed Tywin Lannister	29	4	8
386	 to destroy his rivals on every compass point.	29	4	8
387	 Who stands against him now?	29	4	8
388	 Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish?	29	4	8
389	 Robb Stark is dead.	29	4	8
390	 Id have you back Robin Arryn,	29	4	8
391	 Lord of the Vale.	29	4	8
392	 Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.	29	4	8
393	 And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.	29	4	8
394	 More often they die young.	29	4	8
395	 I adored Lysa with all my heart.	29	4	8
396	 But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective.	29	4	8
397	 He needs to learn how to swing a sword.	29	4	8
398	 How to ride a horse.	29	4	8
399	  Aye, its time.  Yes, its time.	29	4	8
400	 Time for him to tour the Vale,	29	4	8
401	 to visit all the castles in his domain.	30	4	8
402	 Time for Robin to leave the nest.	30	4	8
403	 (grunts)	30	4	8
404	   Ser Barristan.	30	4	8
405	 Yes?	30	4	8
406	 Who sent you?	30	4	8
407	  Ser Barristan.  Ser Jorah.	31	4	8
408	 Have I forgotten a council meeting?	31	4	8
409	 No.	31	4	8
410	 Whats this?	31	4	8
411	 A royal pardon	31	4	8
412	 signed by Robert Baratheon.	31	4	8
413	 You spied on her.	32	4	8
414	 Who gave you this?	32	4	8
415	 Does it matter?	32	4	8
416	 Have you told her?	32	4	8
417	 I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man	32	4	8
418	 rather than go behind your back.	32	4	8
419	 Let me speak with her in private.	32	4	8
420	 Youll never be alone with her again.	32	4	8
421	 Why did the usurper pardon you?	33	4	8
422	 If we could speak alone.	33	4	8
423	 No, speak to me here.	33	4	8
424	 Explain it to me.	33	4	8
425	 Who do you think sent this to Meereen?	33	4	8
426	 Who profits?	33	4	8
427	 This is the work of Tywin Lannister.	33	4	8
428	 He wants to divide us.	33	4	8
429	 If were fighting each other, were not fighting him.	33	4	8
430	 The pardon was signed the year we met.	33	4	8
431	 Why were you pardoned?	33	4	8
432	 Unless youre saying this document was forged.	33	4	8
433	 It is not forged.	34	4	8
434	 Why, then?	34	4	8
435	 I sent letters to Varys,	34	4	8
436	 the spymaster of Kings Landing.	34	4	8
437	 What was the content of these letters?	34	4	8
438	  Information.  What information?	34	4	8
439	 When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos.	34	4	8
440	 His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo.	34	4	8
441	 When you were married.	34	4	8
442	 When your brother died.	34	4	8
443	 You told him I was carrying Drogos child?	34	4	8
444	  I  Yes or no?	34	4	8
445	  Khaleesi.   Dont call me that.	34	4	8
446	 Did you tell him I was carrying Drogos child?	34	4	8
447	 Yes.	34	4	8
448	 That wine merchant tried to poison me	34	4	8
449	 because of your information.	34	4	8
450	 I stopped you from drinking his wine.	34	4	8
451	 Because you knew it was poisoned.	34	4	8
452	 I suspected.	34	4	8
453	 You betrayed me	34	4	8
454	 from the first.	34	4	8
455	 Forgive me.	35	4	8
456	 I never meant	35	4	8
457	 please, Khaleesi, forgive me.	35	4	8
458	 You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father	35	4	8
459	  and stole my brothers throne  I have protected you.	35	4	8
460	 Fought for you. Killed for you.	35	4	8
461	 and you want me to forgive you?	35	4	8
462	 I have loved you.	35	4	8
463	 Love?	35	4	8
464	 Love? How can you say that to me?	35	4	8
465	 Any other man, and I would have you executed.	35	4	8
466	 But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive.	35	4	8
467	 Go back to your masters in Kings Landing.	35	4	8
468	 Collect your pardon if you can.	35	4	8
469	 Daenerys, please.	35	4	8
470	 Dont ever presume to touch me again	35	4	8
471	 or speak my name.	35	4	8
472	 You have until dusk to collect your things	35	4	8
473	 and leave this city.	35	4	8
474	 If youre found in Meereen past break of day,	35	4	8
475	 Ill have your head thrown into Slavers Bay.	36	4	8
476	 Go.	36	4	8
477	 Now.	36	4	8
478	 (footsteps departing)	36	4	8
479	 Moat Cailin is yours, Father.	37	4	8
480	 Walk with me.	37	4	8
481	 Has there been any word from Locke?	37	4	8
482	 No.	37	4	8
483	 Unimportant.	37	4	8
484	 A cripple, a young boy.	37	4	8
485	 None of the northern lords have seen them.	37	4	8
486	 Dead most likely.	37	4	8
487	 Most of the ironborn have fled the North.	37	4	8
488	 Now more will follow, thanks to you.	37	4	8
489	 Tell me what you see.	37	4	8
490	 Moors, fields, hills.	38	4	8
491	 Tell me what you see.	38	4	8
492	 Nothing.	38	4	8
493	 Not nothing.	38	4	8
494	 The North.	38	4	8
495	 Ride 700 miles that way, youre still in the North.	38	4	8
496	 400 miles that way.	38	4	8
497	 300 miles that way.	38	4	8
498	 The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined.	38	4	8
499	 And I am the Warden of the North.	38	4	8
500	 The North is mine.	38	4	8
501	 Now tell me, what is your name?	38	4	8
502	 Ramsay Snow.	38	4	8
503	 No, not Ramsay Snow.	38	4	8
504	 Open it.	38	4	8
505	 From this day until your last day,	39	4	8
506	 you are Ramsay Bolton,	39	4	8
507	 son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North.	39	4	8
508	 You honor me.	39	4	8
509	 I swear I will uphold your name	39	4	8
510	 and your tradition.	39	4	8
511	 I will be worthy of you, Father,	39	4	8
512	 I promise.	39	4	8
513	 Come, Reek, Ill be needing a bath.	39	4	8
514	 (knocks)	40	4	8
515	 Yes?	40	4	8
516	 (door closes)	40	4	8
517	 First time I saw you, you were just a child.	40	4	8
518	 A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time.	40	4	8
519	 Not a child any longer.	40	4	8
520	 Why did you help me?	40	4	8
521	 They would have thrown you through the Moon Door	41	4	8
522	 if they found you guilty.	41	4	8
523	 Thats not an answer.	41	4	8
524	 If theyd have executed you,	41	4	8
525	 what would they have done with me?	41	4	8
526	 I dont know.	41	4	8
527	 Neither do I.	41	4	8
528	 Better to gamble on the man you know	41	4	8
529	 than the strangers you dont?	41	4	8
530	 And you think you know me?	41	4	8
531	 I know what you want.	41	4	8
532	 Do you?	41	4	8
533	   I thought itd make me happy,	41	4	8
534	 but it doesnt. Not really.	42	4	8
535	   Nothing makes you happy.	42	4	8
536	  Lots of things make me happy.  Like what?	42	4	8
537	 Killing Polliver, killing Rorge.	42	4	8
538	 So youre sad because you didnt get to kill Joffrey yourself.	42	4	8
539	 Is that it?	42	4	8
540	 At least I could have been there to watch.	42	4	8
541	 I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.	42	4	8
542	 Aye, nothing in the world beats that look.	42	4	8
543	 You protected him for most of his life.	42	4	8
544	 You think you could have saved him?	42	4	8
545	 I wasnt the damn wine taster.	42	4	8
546	 Little shit deserved to die, but poison	42	4	8
547	 poisons a womans weapon.	42	4	8
548	 Men kill with steel.	42	4	8
549	 Thats your stupid pride talking.	42	4	8
550	 Its why youll never be a great killer.	42	4	8
551	 Id have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.	42	4	8
552	 (laughs)	42	4	8
553	 Id pay good money to see that.	42	4	8
554	 (groans)	42	4	8
555	 You should have let me burn it.	43	4	8
556	 Its a fleabite.	43	4	8
557	 That fleabites got you walking a lot slower than you used to.	43	4	8
558	 Well, we wont have to walk too much further.	43	4	8
559	 You really think my aunt will pay for me?	43	4	8
560	 Aye, shell pay.	43	4	8
561	 Ive never even met her.	43	4	8
562	 Doesnt matter. Youre her blood.	43	4	8
563	 Family, honor, all that horseshit.	43	4	8
564	 Its all you lords and ladies ever talk about.	43	4	8
565	 Im not a lady.	43	4	8
566	   Who would pass the Bloody Gate?	43	4	8
567	 The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane.	43	4	8
568	 And his	43	4	8
569	 traveling companion Arya Stark,	43	4	8
570	 niece of your lady Lysa Arryn.	43	4	8
571	 Then I offer my condolences.	43	4	8
572	 Lady Arryn died.	43	4	8
573	 Three days ago.	44	4	8
574	 (laughing)	44	4	8
575	 (laughing continues)	44	4	8
576	 Ive never left home before, Uncle Petyr.	44	4	8
577	  Im afraid to leave.  You shouldnt be.	44	4	8
578	 The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said.	44	4	8
579	 She said its not safe outside.	44	4	8
580	 It wasnt safe for her inside.	44	4	8
581	 People die at their dinner tables.	44	4	8
582	 They die in their beds.	44	4	8
583	 They die squatting over their chamber pots.	44	4	8
584	 Everybody dies sooner or later.	44	4	8
585	 Dont worry about your death.	44	4	8
586	 Worry about your life.	44	4	8
587	 Take charge of your life	44	4	8
588	 for as long as it lasts.	45	4	8
589	 That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.	45	4	8
590	 (footsteps)	45	4	8
591	 Shall we go?	45	4	8
592	 Wine always helps.	45	4	8
593	 I thank you for it.	45	4	8
594	 Trial by combat.	45	4	8
595	 Deciding a mans guilt or innocence	45	4	8
596	 in the eyes of the gods	46	4	8
597	 by having two other men hack each other to pieces.	46	4	8
598	 Tells you something about the gods.	46	4	8
599	 How much longer?	46	4	8
600	 Soon.	46	4	8
601	 Do you think Oberyn has a chance?	46	4	8
602	 The Red Viper of Dorne.	46	4	8
603	 You dont get a name like that unless youre deadly, right?	46	4	8
604	 Ive never seen him fight.	46	4	8
605	 Oh, hes going to die. Im going to die.	46	4	8
606	 Oberyn believes in himself.	46	4	8
607	 Thats putting it mildly.	46	4	8
608	 Whats the punishment for regicide?	46	4	8
609	 Drawing and quartering? Hanging?	46	4	8
610	   Breaking at the wheel?  Beheading.	46	4	8
611	 Seems rather ordinary.	46	4	8
612	 And he was my nephew as well, so what is that?	46	4	8
613	 Fratricide is brothers.	46	4	8
614	 Filicide is sons.	46	4	8
615	 Nepoticide. Thats the one.	47	4	8
616	 Matricide, patricide,	47	4	8
617	 infanticide, suicide.	47	4	8
618	 Theres no kind of killing that doesnt have its own word.	47	4	8
619	 Cousins.	47	4	8
620	 Cousins, youre right.	47	4	8
621	 There is no word for cousin killing.	47	4	8
622	 Well done.	47	4	8
623	 Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?	47	4	8
624	 Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head.	47	4	8
625	  Left him simple.   Simple?	47	4	8
626	 Used to sit all day in the garden.	47	4	8
627	 Crushing beetles with a rock.	47	4	8
628	 (both grunting)	47	4	8
629	 (chuckles) Nothing made him happier.	47	4	8
630	 Nothing made you happier.	47	4	8
631	 Youd think being tormented from birth	47	4	8
632	 would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.	47	4	8
633	 On the contrary. Laughing at another persons misery	47	4	8
634	 was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.	47	4	8
635	 The joke wore thin, though.	48	4	8
636	 For you. You drifted away.	48	4	8
637	 I had other interests.	48	4	8
638	 Yes, other interests.	48	4	8
639	 But I stayed with Orson.	48	4	8
640	 Why?	48	4	8
641	 I was curious.	48	4	8
642	 Why was he smashing all those beetles?	48	4	8
643	 What did he get out of it?	48	4	8
644	 First thing I did was ask him.	48	4	8
645	 Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?	48	4	8
646	 He gave me an answer. Smash the beetles.	48	4	8
647	 Smash em. (grunting)	48	4	8
648	 I wasnt deterred.	48	4	8
649	 I was the smartest person I knew.	48	4	8
650	 Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries	48	4	8
651	 that lay at the heart of a moron.	48	4	8
652	 So I went to Maester Volariks library.	48	4	8
653	 Volarik. Tried to touch me once.	48	4	8
654	 Turns out, far too much has been written about great men	48	4	8
655	 and not nearly enough about morons.	48	4	8
656	 Doesnt seem right.	48	4	8
657	 In any case, I found nothing	49	4	8
658	 that illuminated the nature of Orsons affliction	49	4	8
659	 or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter.	49	4	8
660	 So I went back to the source.	49	4	8
661	 I may not have been able to speak with Orson,	49	4	8
662	 but I could observe him, watch him	49	4	8
663	 the way men watch animals	49	4	8
664	 to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior.	49	4	8
665	 And as I watched,	49	4	8
666	 I became more and more sure of it.	49	4	8
667	 There was something happening there.	49	4	8
668	 His face was like the page of a book	49	4	8
669	 written in a language I didnt understand.	49	4	8
670	 But he wasnt mindless. He had his reasons.	49	4	8
671	 And I became possessed with knowing what they were.	49	4	8
672	 I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him.	49	4	8
673	 I would eat my lunch in the garden,	49	4	8
674	 chewing my mutton to the music of	49	4	8
675	 (grunting)	49	4	8
676	 And when I wasnt watching him, I was thinking about him.	50	4	8
677	 Father droned on about the family legacy	50	4	8
678	 and I thought about Orsons beetles.	50	4	8
679	 I read the histories of Targaryen conquests.	50	4	8
680	 Did I hear dragon wings? No.	50	4	8
681	 I heard (grunting)	50	4	8
682	 And I still couldnt figure out why he was doing it.	50	4	8
683	 And I had to know, because it was horrible	50	4	8
684	 that all these beetles should be dying for no reason.	50	4	8
685	 Every day around the world,	50	4	8
686	 men, women, and children are murdered by the score.	50	4	8
687	 Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?	50	4	8
688	 I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread.	50	4	8
689	 Piles and piles of them, years and years of them.	50	4	8
690	 How many countless living crawling things	50	4	8
691	 smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt?	50	4	8
692	 In my dreams I found myself	50	4	8
693	 standing on a beach made of beetle husks	50	4	8
694	 stretching as far as the eye could see.	50	4	8
695	 I woke up crying,	50	4	8
696	 weeping for their shattered little bodies.	51	4	8
697	 I tried to stop Orson once.	51	4	8
698	 He was twice your size.	51	4	8
699	 He just pushed me aside with a kuuh	51	4	8
700	 and kept on smashing.	51	4	8
701	 Every day until that mule	51	4	8
702	 kicked him in the chest and killed him.	51	4	8
703	 So what do you think?	51	4	8
704	 Why did he do it?	51	4	8
705	 What was it all about?	51	4	8
706	 I dont know.	51	4	8
707	 (bells tolling)	51	4	8
708	 Good luck today.	52	4	8
709	 (door closes)	52	4	8
710	 (crowd shouting)	52	4	8
711	 Looks like very light armor.	52	4	8
712	 I like to move around.	52	4	8
713	 You could at least wear a helmet.	52	4	8
714	 You shouldnt drink before a fight.	52	4	8
715	 You learn this during your years in the fighting pits?	52	4	8
716	 I always drink before a fight.	52	4	8
717	 It could get you killed. It could get me killed.	53	4	8
718	 Today is not the day I die.	53	4	8
719	 (crowd cheering)	53	4	8
720	 Youre going to fight that?	53	4	8
721	 Im going to kill that.	53	4	8
722	 He is the biggest man Ive ever seen.	53	4	8
723	 Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.	53	4	8
724	 Thank the gods.	53	4	8
725	 (horn blows)	53	4	8
726	 In the sight of gods and men,	53	4	8
727	 we gather to ascertain	53	4	8
728	 the guilt or innocence of this	53	4	8
729	 man Tyrion Lannister.	53	4	8
730	 May the Mother grant them mercy.	53	4	8
731	 May the Father give them such justice as they deserve.	53	4	8
732	 And may the Warrior guide the hand	53	4	8
733	   (horn blows)  of our champion	54	4	8
734	 Dont leave me alone in this world.	54	4	8
735	 Never.	54	4	8
736	 (crowd cheering)	54	4	8
737	 Have they told you who I am?	54	4	8
738	 Some dead man.	54	4	8
739	 I am the brother of Elia Martell.	54	4	8
740	 Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking	54	4	8
741	 shit-pile of a city?	54	4	8
742	 For you.	55	4	8
743	 Im going to hear you confess before you die.	55	4	8
744	 You raped my sister.	55	4	8
745	 You murdered her.	55	4	8
746	 You killed her children.	55	4	8
747	 Say it now and we can make this quick.	55	4	8
748	 (shouting)	55	4	8
749	 Say it. You raped her.	55	4	8
750	 You murdered her.	55	4	8
751	 (shouts)	55	4	8
752	 You killed her children.	55	4	8
753	 (growls)	55	4	8
754	 You raped her!	55	4	8
755	 You murdered her!	55	4	8
756	 You killed her children!	56	4	8
757	 (grunts)	56	4	8
758	 (crowd cheering)	56	4	8
759	 (groans)	56	4	8
760	 You raped her!	56	4	8
761	 You murdered her!	56	4	8
762	 (screams)	56	4	8
763	 You killed her children!	57	4	8
764	 (groans)	57	4	8
765	 (crowd clamoring)	57	4	8
766	 Wait. Are you dying?	57	4	8
767	 No, no, no.	57	4	8
768	 You cant die yet. You havent confessed.	57	4	8
769	 Say it.	57	4	8
770	 Say her name. Elia Martell.	57	4	8
771	 You raped her. You killed her children.	57	4	8
772	 Elia Martell.	57	4	8
773	 Who gave you the order?	57	4	8
774	 Who gave you the order?!	57	4	8
775	 Say her name!	57	4	8
776	 You raped her! You murdered her!	57	4	8
777	 You killed her children.	57	4	8
778	 Say it. Say her name.	57	4	8
779	  Say it!  (grunts)	57	4	8
780	 (teeth rattle)	58	4	8
781	 Elia Martell.	58	4	8
782	 (screaming)	58	4	8
783	 I killed her children.	58	4	8
784	 Then I raped her.	58	4	8
785	 Then I smashed her head in like this!	58	4	8
786	 (screaming)	58	4	8
787	 The gods have made their will known.	58	4	8
788	 Tyrion Lannister,	58	4	8
789	 in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon,	58	4	8
790	 First of His Name,	58	4	8
791	 you are hereby sentenced to death.	58	4	8
792		58	4	8
793	  music playing 	59	4	8
794		0	4	8
0		1	6	5
1	 Yes?	2	6	5
2	 For you, my lady.	2	6	5
3	 How far is Mole's Town?	2	6	5
4	 Sansa.	2	6	5
5	 Lady Brienne.	2	6	5
6	 When I heard you had escaped Winterfell, I feared the worst.	2	6	5
7	 You have no idea how happy I am	2	6	5
8	 to see you unharmed.	2	6	5
9	 Unharmed?	3	6	5
10	 What are you doing here?	3	6	5
11	 I rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid.	3	6	5
12	 They're encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak.	3	6	5
13	 To come to my aid?	3	6	5
14	 Did you know about Ramsay?	3	6	5
15	 If you didn't know, you're an idiot.	3	6	5
16	 If you did know, you're my enemy.	3	6	5
17	 Would you like to hear about our wedding night?	3	6	5
18	 He never hurt my face.	3	6	5
19	 He needed my face, the face of Ned Stark's daughter.	3	6	5
20	 But the rest of me,	3	6	5
21	 he did what he liked with the rest of me	3	6	5
22	 as long as I could still give him an heir.	3	6	5
23	 What do you think he did?	3	6	5
24	 I can't begin to contemplate--	3	6	5
25	 What do you think he did to me?	4	6	5
26	 Lady Sansa asked you a question.	4	6	5
27	 He beat you.	4	6	5
28	 Yes, he enjoyed that.	4	6	5
29	 What else do you think he did?	4	6	5
30	 - Sansa, I-- - What else?	4	6	5
31	 Did he cut you?	4	6	5
32	 - Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along. - I didn't know.	4	6	5
33	 I thought you knew everyone's secrets.	4	6	5
34	 I made a mistake, a horrible mistake.	4	6	5
35	 I underestimated a stranger.	4	6	5
36	 The other things he did,	4	6	5
37	 ladies aren't supposed to talk about those things,	4	6	5
38	 but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time.	4	6	5
39	 I can still feel it.	4	6	5
40	 I don't mean in my tender heart it still pains me so.	4	6	5
41	 I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now.	4	6	5
42	 I'm so sorry.	5	6	5
43	 You said you would protect me.	5	6	5
44	 And I will. You must believe me when I tell you that I will.	5	6	5
45	 I don't believe you anymore. I don't need you anymore.	5	6	5
46	 You can't protect me.	5	6	5
47	 You won't even be able to protect yourself	5	6	5
48	 if I tell Brienne to cut you down.	5	6	5
49	 And why shouldn't I?	5	6	5
50	 Do you want me to beg for my life?	5	6	5
51	 If that's what you want, I will.	5	6	5
52	 Whatever you ask that is in my power,	5	6	5
53	 I will do.	5	6	5
54	 What if I want you to die here and now?	5	6	5
55	 Then I will die.	5	6	5
56	 You freed me from the monsters who murdered my family	5	6	5
57	 and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family.	5	6	5
58	 Go back to Moat Cailin.	5	6	5
59	 My brother and I will take back the North on our own.	6	6	5
60	 I never want to see you again.	6	6	5
61	 I would do anything to undo what's been done to you.	6	6	5
62	 I know that I can't.	6	6	5
63	 Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go?	6	6	5
64	 Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish	6	6	5
65	 has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun.	6	6	5
66	 You might consider seeking him out.	6	6	5
67	 The time may come when you need an army loyal to you.	6	6	5
68	 I have an army.	6	6	5
69	 Your brother's army.	6	6	5
70	 Half-brother.	6	6	5
71	 You're not ready.	7	6	5
72	 You should go home before it's too late.	7	6	5
73	 You'll never be one of us, Lady Stark.	8	6	5
74	 She has a point.	8	6	5
75	 None of the first Faceless Men were born to lords and ladies.	8	6	5
76	 They began as slaves in the mines of Valyria.	8	6	5
77	 Who was the first?	9	6	5
78	 He was no one.	9	6	5
79	 The Many-Faced God taught him how to shed his face	9	6	5
80	 and how to give the gift.	9	6	5
81	 The man taught others in exchange for their service.	9	6	5
82	 Many served, many more gifts were given.	9	6	5
83	 Soon all the masters and overseers were gone	9	6	5
84	 and the Faceless Men fled.	9	6	5
85	 Where did they go?	9	6	5
86	 Here.	9	6	5
87	 They founded the Free City of Braavos and built this house.	9	6	5
88	 These were the faces they wore in life	9	6	5
89	 when they were not wearing others.	9	6	5
90	 The first Faceless Men.	9	6	5
91	 And now a girl is one of them,	9	6	5
92	 if a girl desires.	9	6	5
93	 A girl has no desires.	9	6	5
94	 Who?	9	6	5
95	 An actress who calls herself Lady Crane.	10	6	5
96	 She performs at the theater in Sheelba Square.	10	6	5
97	 A girl has been given a second chance.	10	6	5
98	 There will not be a third.	10	6	5
99	 One way or another,	10	6	5
100	 a face will be added to the hall.	10	6	5
101	 Ahh!	10	6	5
102	 Oh, murdered by a boar.	10	6	5
103	 The great big hairy whore.	10	6	5
104	 He dug in his tusks and dug out my guts	10	6	5
105	 and soon I am no more.	11	6	5
106	 Oh, come, Father, in bed you must lie.	11	6	5
107	 I love you, Father. Please don't die.	11	6	5
108	 Shut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine.	11	6	5
109	 I feel the winds of winter as they lick across the land.	11	6	5
110	 And our son alone on that cold, cold throne	11	6	5
111	 without a guiding hand.	11	6	5
112	 Who will teach him strength? Who will teach him grace?	11	6	5
113	 To whom will he turn when it's time to learn to look darkness in the face?	11	6	5
114	 Ned Stark will do fine. Now bring me more wine.	11	6	5
115	 Ooh!	11	6	5
116	 Ooh, what's happened here, then?	11	6	5
117	 He brought you here, Ned Stark,	11	6	5
118	 'cause you're the brightest fellow in the land.	11	6	5
119	 You should be king of us all	11	6	5
120	 and I should be your Hand.	11	6	5
121	 We men of the North are right good hands	11	6	5
122	 at keeping people lawful.	11	6	5
123	 I'd ask him for permission,	11	6	5
124	 but he smells too bloody awful.	12	6	5
125	 I die! I die!	12	6	5
126	 And here I now must lie.	12	6	5
127	 Oh, woe. Oh, no.	12	6	5
128	 Oh, I am about to go.	12	6	5
129	 Will you stay on as Joffrey's Hand?	12	6	5
130	 The Iron Throne's what I demand.	12	6	5
131	 - You cannot. - I can.	12	6	5
132	 - You will not. - I will.	12	6	5
133	 - You dare not. - I dare yes.	12	6	5
134	 - The line of succession. - What's that mean?	12	6	5
135	 - The proper progression. - What's that mean?	12	6	5
136	 - The lawful ascension. - What's that mean?	12	6	5
137	 So move along, give me my chair	12	6	5
138	 and there won't be no more trouble.	12	6	5
139	 But we had a deal all done and dusted.	13	6	5
140	 I'm starting to think you can't be trusted.	13	6	5
141	 Save my father.	13	6	5
142	 Truly you should. Killing the man will do you no good.	13	6	5
143	 - Save him, please. - Show him mercy.	13	6	5
144	 Show the people what a good king should be.	13	6	5
145	 Good people, you may all relax.	13	6	5
146	 My father's friend shall be spared the--	13	6	5
147	  Father! No!	13	6	5
148	 Oh, Father. Oh!	13	6	5
149	 Worry not!	13	6	5
150	 All is well.	13	6	5
151	 I have here a decree	13	6	5
152	 from my father Tywin Lannister,	13	6	5
153	 the richest man you'll see.	14	6	5
154	 He proclaims me Hand of the King.	14	6	5
155	 The position's mine for life.	14	6	5
156	 And he's given me permission to take	14	6	5
157	 Sansa as my wife.	14	6	5
158	 You'll learn that what I lack in height,	14	6	5
159	 I make up for in appetite.	14	6	5
160	 So let's forget about your plight,	14	6	5
161	 and go rehearse our wedding night.	14	6	5
162	 It's a wart. Two warts.	14	6	5
163	 I've got two fucking warts on my cock.	14	6	5
164	 Well, don't worry, love. They usually go away in five or six years.	14	6	5
165	 Oh, wash this, darling. It stinks of me.	14	6	5
166	 You can do better, Bianca, dear. You must do.	14	6	5
167	 I had two lines.	14	6	5
168	 There are no small parts. You rang very false.	14	6	5
169	 I rang very false?	14	6	5
170	 What you need, love, is for someone to ring you true.	14	6	5
171	 You weren't complaining about me last night.	15	6	5
172	 May I get you some wine, Lady Crane?	15	6	5
173	 I'm a rum girl, Bobono.	15	6	5
174	 You need to know that if we're going to be intimate.	15	6	5
175	 Of course we're going to be intimate.	15	6	5
176	 It's only a matter of time.	15	6	5
177	 To our children.	15	6	5
178	 May they have your talent.	15	6	5
179	 And your filthy mind.	15	6	5
180	 A girl will poison the rum.	15	6	5
181	 Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.	15	6	5
182	 If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall...	15	6	5
183	 A girl is not ready.	15	6	5
184	 She's a good actress.	15	6	5
185	 So a man has heard.	15	6	5
186	 Seems like a decent woman.	15	6	5
187	 Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?	16	6	5
188	 No.	16	6	5
189	 Who wants her dead?	16	6	5
190	 That does not matter. The price was paid.	16	6	5
191	 The younger actress.	16	6	5
192	 She's jealous because Lady Crane is better.	16	6	5
193	 A girl must decide if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God.	16	6	5
194	 A girl has decided.	16	6	5
195	 A servant does not ask questions.	16	6	5
196	 No! No! No!	17	6	5
197	 It was you.	18	6	5
198	 You made the white walkers.	18	6	5
199	 We were at war.	18	6	5
200	 We were being slaughtered.	18	6	5
201	 Our sacred trees cut down.	18	6	5
202	 We needed to defend ourselves.	18	6	5
203	 From whom?	18	6	5
204	 From you.	18	6	5
205	 From men.	18	6	5
206	 We speak in the presence of the Drowned God.	18	6	5
207	 In his name we gather today	18	6	5
208	 to choose a new king as our leader.	18	6	5
209	 Who makes a claim?	18	6	5
210	 I am Yara Greyjoy,	19	6	5
211	 daughter of Balon Greyjoy,	19	6	5
212	 King of the Iron Islands.	19	6	5
213	 I claim the Salt Throne.	19	6	5
214	 We've never had a queen. Not once.	19	6	5
215	 There are many things we've never done.	19	6	5
216	 We've never made our mark upon the world.	19	6	5
217	 The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind	19	6	5
218	 until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms	19	6	5
219	 long enough to become a nuisance.	19	6	5
220	 Then they swat us down.	19	6	5
221	 They conquer us, humiliate us,	19	6	5
222	 and go right back to forgetting we exist.	19	6	5
223	 Aye!	19	6	5
224	 - We are a sea people. - Aye!	19	6	5
225	 - Our god is a sea god. - Aye!	19	6	5
226	 When I am queen, we will build a fleet that--	19	6	5
227	 - You shall not be queen! - I am not finished!	19	6	5
228	 Yes, you are! A woman will not lead us.	19	6	5
229	 Not when Balon's own male heir has returned.	19	6	5
230	 I am Theon Greyjoy...	20	6	5
231	 last living son of Balon Greyjoy.	20	6	5
232	 And she is your rightful ruler.	20	6	5
233	 Aye!	20	6	5
234	 Those of you that have sailed under her,	20	6	5
235	 and there are many of you here,	20	6	5
236	 - you know what she is. - Aye!	20	6	5
237	 - She is a reaver. - Aye!	20	6	5
238	 - She is a warrior. - Aye!	20	6	5
239	 She is ironborn!	21	6	5
240	 Aye!	21	6	5
241	 We will find no better leader.	21	6	5
242	 This is our queen.	21	6	5
243	 Yara! Yara! Yara!	21	6	5
244	 I'm Euron Greyjoy.	21	6	5
245	 I claim the Salt Throne.	21	6	5
246	 Niece.	21	6	5
247	 Nephew.	21	6	5
248	 Little Theon.	21	6	5
249	 Heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground.	21	6	5
250	 Captured a castle you couldn't keep.	21	6	5
251	 Got yourself taken prisoner.	21	6	5
252	 Even heard you have no cock.	21	6	5
253	 Explains why you think a woman can be king.	22	6	5
254	 When did you return, Uncle?	22	6	5
255	 A few days ago.	22	6	5
256	 I had some things to take care of.	22	6	5
257	 Long overdue.	22	6	5
258	 I'm glad you're here.	22	6	5
259	 Now I know what my first act as queen will be.	22	6	5
260	 To execute the man who killed my father.	22	6	5
261	 I did.	22	6	5
262	 I killed him.	22	6	5
263	 Threw him right over a rope bridge	22	6	5
264	 and watched him fall.	22	6	5
265	 He was leading us nowhere	22	6	5
266	 and we would still be heading there if it weren't for me.	22	6	5
267	 No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him.	22	6	5
268	 He led us into two wars we couldn't win.	22	6	5
269	 I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.	22	6	5
270	 That would have been hard to do.	23	6	5
271	 You weren't here.	23	6	5
272	 Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time.	23	6	5
273	 Gallivanting?	23	6	5
274	 That the sort of thing you start to say	23	6	5
275	 once your dick gets chopped off?	23	6	5
276	 Did the great lords of Westeros teach you words like that?	23	6	5
277	 You were gone.	23	6	5
278	 Yara was here.	23	6	5
279	 Being ironborn. Leading ironborn.	23	6	5
280	 Getting ready to bring us back to glory.	23	6	5
281	 And how will she do that?	23	6	5
282	 I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.	23	6	5
283	 Right idea, except I'm the one who's going to build the Iron Fleet	23	6	5
284	 because I'm the one who knows how to use it.	23	6	5
285	 I've been all over the world.	23	6	5
286	 I've seen more of it than all of you combined.	23	6	5
287	 And across the sea there is a person	23	6	5
288	 who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do.	23	6	5
289	 Someone with a large army,	24	6	5
290	 three large dragons, and no husband.	24	6	5
291	 I'm going to build that fleet	24	6	5
292	 and I'm going to gallivant right over	24	6	5
293	 and give it to Daenerys Targaryen	24	6	5
294	 along with my big cock.	24	6	5
295	 You're going to seduce the Dragon Queen?	24	6	5
296	 I'm not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her.	24	6	5
297	 And together we're going to take the Seven Kingdoms.	24	6	5
298	 I wasn't born to be king.	24	6	5
299	 I paid the iron price	24	6	5
300	 and here I stand.	24	6	5
301	 Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!	24	6	5
302	 Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!	24	6	5
303	 Euron! Euron!	24	6	5
304	 May Euron, your servant, be born again	24	6	5
305	 from the sea as you were.	25	6	5
306	 Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone.	25	6	5
307	 Bless him with steel.	25	6	5
308	 Listen to the waves. Listen to the god.	25	6	5
309	 He is speaking to us and he says	25	6	5
310	 we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy.	25	6	5
311	 Let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away.	25	6	5
312	 Let the old Euron drown.	25	6	5
313	 Let his lungs fill with seawater.	25	6	5
314	 Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.	25	6	5
315	 What is dead may never die,	25	6	5
316	 but rises again harder and stronger.	25	6	5
317	 What is dead may never die.	26	6	5
318	 What is dead may never die.	26	6	5
319	 Where are my niece and nephew?	27	6	5
320	 Let's go murder them.	27	6	5
321	 They stole our best ships.	27	6	5
322	 Won't be enough to save them.	27	6	5
323	 Go back to your homes.	27	6	5
324	 Chop down every tree you can find.	27	6	5
325	 Quarter-saw the timber and start building.	28	6	5
326	 I want every man bending planks.	28	6	5
327	 I want every woman spinning flax for sails.	28	6	5
328	 Build me a thousand ships	28	6	5
329	 and I will give you this world.	28	6	5
330	 I banished you twice.	28	6	5
331	 You came back twice.	28	6	5
332	 And you saved my life.	28	6	5
333	 So I can't take you back	28	6	5
334	 and I can't send you away.	28	6	5
335	 You must send me away.	29	6	5
336	 Is there a cure?	29	6	5
337	 I don't know.	29	6	5
338	 How long does it take?	29	6	5
339	 I don't know that either.	29	6	5
340	 But I've seen what happens when it goes far enough.	29	6	5
341	 I'll end things before that.	29	6	5
342	 I'm sorry.	29	6	5
343	 I'm so sorry.	29	6	5
344	 Don't be.	29	6	5
345	 All I've ever wanted was to serve you.	29	6	5
346	 Tyrion Lannister was right.	29	6	5
347	 I love you.	29	6	5
348	 I'll always love you.	30	6	5
349	 Good-bye, khaleesi.	30	6	5
350	 Do not walk away from your queen,	30	6	5
351	 Jorah the Andal.	30	6	5
352	 You have not been dismissed.	30	6	5
353	 You pledged yourself to me.	30	6	5
354	 You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.	30	6	5
355	 Well, I command you to find the cure	30	6	5
356	 wherever it is in this world.	30	6	5
357	 I command you to heal yourself	30	6	5
358	 and then return to me.	30	6	5
359	 When I take the Seven Kingdoms,	30	6	5
360	 I need you by my side.	30	6	5
361	 In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters,	31	6	5
362	 how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?	31	6	5
363	 None.	31	6	5
364	 And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men?	31	6	5
365	 Two, but that was the day of the pact.	31	6	5
366	 Since then, nothing.	31	6	5
367	 So it's safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.	31	6	5
368	 For now.	32	6	5
369	 For now is the best we get in our profession.	32	6	5
370	 It's not enough.	32	6	5
371	 Considering the city was on the brink of civil war,	32	6	5
372	 I'd say it's a good start.	32	6	5
373	 It's not enough for Meereen to have peace.	32	6	5
374	 They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it.	32	6	5
375	 The Sons of the Harpy have a good story.	32	6	5
376	 Resist the foreign invaders.	32	6	5
377	 Our queen has an even better story.	32	6	5
378	 Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and all that.	32	6	5
379	 The people know who brought them freedom.	32	6	5
380	 Yes, but do they know who brought them security?	32	6	5
381	 Who brought about an end to the violence?	32	6	5
382	 We need someone the people trust,	32	6	5
383	 someone they know cannot be bought or influenced.	32	6	5
384	 Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?	32	6	5
385	" Who said anything about ""him""?"	32	6	5
386	 _	32	6	5
387	 _	32	6	5
388	 _	32	6	5
389	 _	32	6	5
390	 _	33	6	5
391	 _	33	6	5
392	 That's about the extent of my Valyrian.	33	6	5
393	 Thank you for travelling all this way.	33	6	5
394	 I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.	33	6	5
395	 The truth is we need your help.	33	6	5
396	 We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to--	33	6	5
397	 You don't need to persuade me.	33	6	5
398	 I came to help.	33	6	5
399	 Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised.	33	6	5
400	 From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.	33	6	5
401	 Yes.	33	6	5
402	 She has freed the slaves from their chains	33	6	5
403	 and crucified the Masters for their sins.	34	6	5
404	 She did indeed.	34	6	5
405	 Her dragons are fire made flesh,	34	6	5
406	 a gift from the Lord of Light.	34	6	5
407	 But you heard all of this before, haven't you?	34	6	5
408	 On the Long Bridge of Volantis.	34	6	5
409	 The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands,	34	6	5
410	 burning their sins and flesh away.	34	6	5
411	 Ideally we'd avoid purifying too many nonbelievers.	34	6	5
412	 The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.	34	6	5
413	 You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed.	34	6	5
414	 And while she's gone, you want her advisors	34	6	5
415	 to be worshipped and obeyed.	34	6	5
416	 I'd settle for obeyed.	34	6	5
417	 I will summon my most eloquent priests.	34	6	5
418	 They will spread the word.	34	6	5
419	 Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness	34	6	5
420	 in this war and in the great war still to come.	34	6	5
421	 That sounds most excellent.	35	6	5
422	 A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed	35	6	5
423	 as the chosen one by one of your priestesses.	35	6	5
424	 He, too, had a glorious destiny.	35	6	5
425	 He attacked King's Landing and was soundly defeated	35	6	5
426	 by the man standing beside me.	35	6	5
427	 Last I had heard, he had been defeated again,	35	6	5
428	 this time at Winterfell and this time for good.	35	6	5
429	 We'd be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.	35	6	5
430	 I suppose it's hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake.	35	6	5
431	 Isn't that the whole point of being a fanatic?	35	6	5
432	 You're always right.	35	6	5
433	 Everything is the Lord's will.	35	6	5
434	 Everything is the Lord's will.	35	6	5
435	 But men and women make mistakes.	35	6	5
436	 Even honest servants of the Lord.	35	6	5
437	 And you, an honest servant of the Lord,	35	6	5
438	 why should I trust you to know any more	35	6	5
439	 than the priestess who counseled Stannis?	35	6	5
440	 My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion,	35	6	5
441	 but we are all loyal supporters of the queen.	36	6	5
442	 Everyone is what they are	36	6	5
443	 and where they are for a reason.	36	6	5
444	 Terrible things happen for a reason.	36	6	5
445	 Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child.	36	6	5
446	 If not for your mutilation	36	6	5
447	 at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer,	36	6	5
448	 you wouldn't be here helping the Lord's Chosen	36	6	5
449	 bring his light into the world.	36	6	5
450	 Knowledge has made you powerful.	36	6	5
451	 But there's still so much you don't know.	36	6	5
452	 Do you remember what you heard that night	36	6	5
453	 when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire?	36	6	5
454	 You heard a voice call out from the flames. Do you remember?	36	6	5
455	 Should I tell you what the voice said?	37	6	5
456	 Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?	37	6	5
457	 We serve the same queen.	37	6	5
458	 If you are her true friend,	37	6	5
459	 you have nothing to fear from me.	37	6	5
460	 What?	39	6	5
461	 He saw me, the Night King!	41	6	5
462	 - He saw me! - He touched you.	41	6	5
463	 I don't know. He was close, but--	41	6	5
464	 He touched you.	41	6	5
465	 He knows you are here. He'll come for you.	41	6	5
466	 But he can't get in.	41	6	5
467	 He can now. His mark is on you.	41	6	5
468	 You must leave, all of you.	41	6	5
469	 Come on, Hodor. Help me with the sledge.	41	6	5
470	 Hodor.	41	6	5
471	 I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.	41	6	5
472	 - The time has come. - The time for what?	41	6	5
473	 For you to become me.	41	6	5
474	 But am I ready?	41	6	5
475	 No.	41	6	5
476	 We can't defend the north from the walkers	42	6	5
477	 and the south from the Boltons.	42	6	5
478	 If we want to survive, we need Winterfell	42	6	5
479	 and to take Winterfell, we need more men.	42	6	5
480	 Aside from the Starks and the Boltons,	42	6	5
481	 the most powerful houses in the North	42	6	5
482	 are the Umbers, the Karstarks,	42	6	5
483	 and the Manderlys.	42	6	5
484	 The Umbers and the Karstarks	42	6	5
485	 have already declared for the Boltons,	42	6	5
486	 so we're not doing so well there.	42	6	5
487	 The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. They can hang.	42	6	5
488	 But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay	42	6	5
489	 without knowing they had another choice.	42	6	5
490	 I beg your pardon, my lady,	42	6	5
491	 but they know that a Stark beheaded their father.	42	6	5
492	 I don't think we can count on them either.	42	6	5
493	 How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?	42	6	5
494	 Precious little, my lady.	42	6	5
495	 My father always said Northerners are different.	42	6	5
496	 More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders.	42	6	5
497	 They may well be loyal,	43	6	5
498	 but how many rose up against the Boltons	43	6	5
499	 when they betrayed your family?	43	6	5
500	 I may not know the North, but I know men.	43	6	5
501	 They're more or less the same in any corner of the world	43	6	5
502	 and even the bravest of them don't want to see	43	6	5
503	 their wives and children skinned for a lost cause.	43	6	5
504	 If Jon's going to convince them to fight alongside him,	43	6	5
505	 they need to believe it's a fight they can win.	43	6	5
506	 There are more than three other houses in the North--	43	6	5
507	 Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn,	43	6	5
508	 Mazin, Hornwood.	43	6	5
509	 Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others.	43	6	5
510	 We can start small and build.	43	6	5
511	 The North remembers.	43	6	5
512	 They remember the Stark name.	43	6	5
513	 People will still risk everything for it,	43	6	5
514	 from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door.	43	6	5
515	 I don't doubt it.	43	6	5
516	 But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.	43	6	5
517	 No, but I do.	43	6	5
518	 Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark's son	43	6	5
519	 as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's.	44	6	5
520	 And there are also the Tullys. They're not Northern,	44	6	5
521	 but they will back us against the Boltons without question.	44	6	5
522	 I didn't know the Tullys still had an army.	44	6	5
523	 My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it	44	6	5
524	 and retaken Riverrun.	44	6	5
525	 How do you know that?	44	6	5
526	 Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.	44	6	5
527	 That's good.	44	6	5
528	 The Blackfish is a legend.	44	6	5
529	 His support would mean a great deal.	44	6	5
530	 Stark, Tully, a few more houses,	44	6	5
531	 almost starts to look like a winning side.	44	6	5
532	 I've sworn to protect you, my lady.	44	6	5
533	 You heard them. We need more men	44	6	5
534	 and my uncle has an army.	44	6	5
535	 We can send the Blackfish a raven.	44	6	5
536	 Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it.	44	6	5
537	 It has to be you.	44	6	5
538	 Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk to you	44	6	5
539	 and you'll know how to talk to him.	44	6	5
540	 What is it?	44	6	5
541	 I don't like leaving you here alone.	45	6	5
542	 With Jon?	45	6	5
543	 Not him. He seems trustworthy.	45	6	5
544	 A bit brooding, perhaps.	45	6	5
545	 I suppose that's understandable, considering.	45	6	5
546	 The others, though.	45	6	5
547	 Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother	45	6	5
548	 with bloodmagic.	45	6	5
549	 And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they?	45	6	5
550	 Already out looking for a leader with better prospects.	45	6	5
551	 And that wildling fellow with the beard--	45	6	5
552	 Jon isn't Tormund. Jon isn't Davos, the Red Woman	45	6	5
553	 or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon.	45	6	5
554	 He's my brother. He'll keep me safe. I trust him.	45	6	5
555	 Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?	45	6	5
556	 New dress?	46	6	5
557	 I made it myself. Do you like it?	46	6	5
558	 Yeah, it's-- I like the wolf bit.	46	6	5
559	 Good, because I made this for you.	46	6	5
560	 I made it like the one Father used to wear.	46	6	5
561	 As near as I can remember.	46	6	5
562	 Thank you, Sansa.	46	6	5
563	 You're welcome.	46	6	5
564	 Don't knock it down while I'm gone.	46	6	5
565	 I'll do my best.	46	6	5
566	 Good luck.	47	6	5
567	 Should we close the gate, Lord Commander?	47	6	5
568	 I'm not the Lord Comman--	47	6	5
569	 yeah, ahem, close the bloody gate.	47	6	5
570	 We can go home now, Hodor.	48	6	5
571	 Well, maybe not home home,	48	6	5
572	 but somewhere that isn't a cave.	48	6	5
573	 Hodor.	48	6	5
574	 Eat something that isn't moss.	48	6	5
575	 I want an egg. How do you like 'em?	48	6	5
576	 Boiled? Fried up with some butter?	48	6	5
577	 Hodor.	48	6	5
578	 With a rasher of bacon and some blood sausage.	48	6	5
579	 Hodor.	48	6	5
580	 Get Bran and run!	49	6	5
581	 Bran. Bran, wake up.	49	6	5
582	 - Bran. - Hodor. Hodor.	49	6	5
583	 Bran, wake up.	49	6	5
584	 - Gods keep you on the kingsroad. - Take it easy.	50	6	5
585	 Watch yourself.	50	6	5
586	 Hodor.	50	6	5
587	 Hodor. Hodor.	50	6	5
588	 Help me!	50	6	5
589	 Go!	50	6	5
590	 Go!	50	6	5
591	 Remember that you are a Stark.	51	6	5
592	 Comport yourself with dignity at the Vale	51	6	5
593	 and try to stay out of fights.	51	6	5
594	 Yes, Father.	51	6	5
595	 But if you have to fight, win.	51	6	5
596	 Bran! Bran, wake up!	51	6	5
597	 Bran! Bran! Bran, wake up.	52	6	5
598	 - Bran! Bran, wake up! - Hodor. Hodor.	52	6	5
599	 You have to wake up.	52	6	5
600	 - We need Hodor. - Hodor. Hodor.	52	6	5
601	 Bran, we need Hodor.	52	6	5
602	 Bran, you have to wake up. We need Hodor.	52	6	5
603	 Hodor. Hodor.	52	6	5
604	 Bran, we're all going to die!	52	6	5
605	 Bran, wake up!	52	6	5
606	 We're all going to die! Bran! Bran!	52	6	5
607	 Bran, you have to wake up. We need Hodor.	52	6	5
608	 Hodor. Hodor.	52	6	5
609	 Warg into Hodor now!	52	6	5
610	 Bran, wake up. We need Hodor.	52	6	5
611	 We need Hodor. Warg into Hodor now! Now!	52	6	5
612	 Listen to your friend, Brandon.	52	6	5
613	 Hodor. Hodor.	53	6	5
614	 Hodor. Hodor.	53	6	5
615	 Hodor. Hodor.	53	6	5
616	 - Summer! - Go.	53	6	5
617	 Go!	53	6	5
618	 The time has come.	54	6	5
619	 Leave me.	54	6	5
620	 - What are you doing? - Go!	55	6	5
621	 Hodor, hurry!	55	6	5
622	 Hodor!	55	6	5

630	 - Hold the door! - Come on, son.	56	6	5
631	 Hold the door!	56	6	5

0	 1 - You swear it? - By the mother.	2	2	5
1	 My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.	2	2	5
2	 Then I see no reason for hostility between us.	2	2	5
3	 Your son can go on calling himself King in the North,	2	2	5
4	 the Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin,	2	2	5
5	 provided he swears me an oath of fealty.	2	2	5
6	 And the wording of this oath?	2	2	5
7	 The same Ned Stark swore to Robert 18 years ago.	2	2	5
8	 Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together.	2	2	5
9	 And in return for my son's loyalty?	3	2	5
10	 In the morning I'll destroy my brother's army.	3	2	5
11	 When that's done,	3	2	5
12	 Baratheon and Stark will fight	3	2	5
13	 their common enemy together,	3	2	5
14	 as they have done many times before.	3	2	5
15	 Our two houses have always been close,	3	2	5
16	 which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle.	3	2	5
17	 Negotiate a peace with your brother.	3	2	5
18	 Negotiate with Stannis?	3	2	5
19	 You heard him out there.	3	2	5
20	 I'd have better luck debating the wind.	3	2	5
21	 Please bring my terms to your son.	3	2	5
22	 I believe we are natural allies.	3	2	5
23	 I hope he feels the same.	3	2	5
24	 Together we could end this war in a fortnight.	3	2	5
25	 No!	4	2	5
26	 - No. - Follow me!	4	2	5
27	 - You'll die for this. - No, wait, it wasn't her!	4	2	5
28	 - You'll-. - No, wa-	4	2	5
29	 We've got to leave.	5	2	5
30	 They'll hang you for this.	5	2	5
31	 - Inside the King's tent, go! - Now!	5	2	5
32	 I won't leave him.	5	2	5
33	 You can't avenge him if you're dead.	5	2	5
34	 Over there, go!	5	2	5
35	 Not that way.	5	2	5
36	 We need to go home.	6	2	5
37	 - Loras. - My Lord, My Lady.	6	2	5
38	 Get out.	6	2	5
39	 Stannis will be here in an hour.	6	2	5
40	 When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him.	6	2	5
41	 Your former companions will fight for the privilege	6	2	5
42	 of selling you to their new king.	6	2	5
43	 And you want that privilege for yourself.	6	2	5
44	 You will note that I am standing here talking to you,	6	2	5
45	 - not Stannis. - There's no time for this.	6	2	5
46	 Ride back to Highgarden, sister.	6	2	5
47	 I'm not running from Stannis.	6	2	5
48	 Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.	6	2	5
49	 I don't believe that. You don't believe that.	6	2	5
50	 Who gained the most from our king's death?	6	2	5
51	 Stannis.	6	2	5
52	 I will put a sword through his righteous face.	6	2	5
53	 You can't stay here.	6	2	5
54	 He would have been a true king,	7	2	5
55	 a good king.	7	2	5
56	 Tell me, Ser Loras,	7	2	5
57	 what do you desire most in this world?	7	2	5
58	 Revenge.	7	2	5
59	 I have always found that to be the purest of motivations,	7	2	5
60	 but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis,	7	2	5
61	 not today.	7	2	5
62	 You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground.	7	2	5
63	 If it is justice that you want,	7	2	5
64	 be smart about it.	7	2	5
65	 You can't avenge him from the grave.	7	2	5
66	 Bring the horses.	7	2	5
67	 Please.	7	2	5
68	 He was very handsome.	8	2	5
69	 He was, Your Grace.	8	2	5
70	" ""Your Grace."""	8	2	5
71	 Calling yourself king doesn't make you one.	8	2	5
72	 And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen.	8	2	5
73	 Do you want to be a queen?	8	2	5
74	 No.	8	2	5
75	 I want to be the queen.	8	2	5
76	 Killed? By whom?	8	2	5
77	 Accounts differ.	8	2	5
78	 Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.	8	2	5
79	 Really? Who'd have thought?	8	2	5
80	 Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard,	8	2	5
81	 while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it	9	2	5
82	 after negotiations went sour.	9	2	5
83	 Whomever did it, I say well done.	9	2	5
84	 It's not what Varys says.	9	2	5
85	 He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis,	9	2	5
86	 which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea.	9	2	5
87	 Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.	9	2	5
88	 And I say father raised you to have too much respect for money.	9	2	5
89	 Stannis Baratheon is coming for us,	9	2	5
90	 sooner rather than later.	9	2	5
91	 Aren't there other things you should be doing,	9	2	5
92	 like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?	9	2	5
93	 She'll be safer in Dorne.	9	2	5
94	 Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety.	9	2	5
95	 It so happens that I am.	9	2	5
96	 Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl	9	2	5
97	 and I don't blame her at all for you.	9	2	5
98	 So clever.	9	2	5
99	 Aren't you always so clever	9	2	5
100	 with your schemes and your plots?	9	2	5
101	 Schemes and plots are the same thing.	9	2	5
102	 They are going to attack us.	9	2	5
103	 We need to be ready.	9	2	5
104	 No need to concern yourself over it.	9	2	5
105	 The King is taking personal charge of siege preparations.	9	2	5
106	 May I ask specifically what the King has in mind?	10	2	5
107	 You may specifically or you may ask vaguely.	10	2	5
108	 The answer will be the same.	10	2	5
109	 It's important that we talk about this.	10	2	5
110	 It's the King's royal prerogative	10	2	5
111	 to withhold sensitive information from his councilors.	10	2	5
112	 It's wildfire.	10	2	5
113	 Wildfire?	10	2	5
114	 You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?	10	2	5
115	 - No. - That's a lie right there.	10	2	5
116	 It is not a lie. Why would I lie?	10	2	5
117	 Tell me,	10	2	5
118	 if the vile allegations	10	2	5
119	 against my brother and sister are true,	10	2	5
120	 do you think it will make Jaime more likely	11	2	5
121	 to kill you or less likely?	11	2	5
122	 When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean.	11	2	5
123	 I'm telling you the truth.	11	2	5
124	 The smart money would be on more likely.	11	2	5
125	 She's making wildfire.	11	2	5
126	 But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.	11	2	5
127	 The alchemists' guild is being commissioned.	11	2	5
128	 I suppose there's only one way to find out.	11	2	5
129	 They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults.	11	2	5
130	 They are planning to launch them from the city walls	11	2	5
131	 into Stannis's ships and armies.	11	2	5
132	 Please.	11	2	5
133	 When did she tell you this?	11	2	5
134	 I heard her talking with the Pyromancer.	11	2	5
135	 And the other night after I left her,	11	2	5
136	 she went to meet him.	11	2	5
137	 - I swear to you. - Swear to me on what?	11	2	5
138	 - On my life. - But I don't care about your life.	11	2	5
139	 In the Light of the Seven,	11	2	5
140	 by all that is holy and right,	11	2	5
141	 I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow--	11	2	5
142	 All right, all right. Enough.	11	2	5
143	 Even torturing you is boring.	12	2	5
144	 Just get out.	12	2	5
145	 Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn	12	2	5
146	 to please kill you if anything should happen to me.	12	2	5
147	 Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion.	12	2	5
148	 It will be my pleasure.	12	2	5
149	 - Your Grace. - What is it?	12	2	5
150	 Your Grace.	12	2	5
151	 I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace.	12	2	5
152	 I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him.	12	2	5
153	 Your Grace.	12	2	5
154	 - Fools love a fool. - Your Grace.	12	2	5
155	 I grieve for him as well-- for the boy he was,	12	2	5
156	 not the man he grew to be.	12	2	5
157	 I need to speak to you about what I saw in that cave.	12	2	5
158	 I thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to	12	2	5
159	 speak to me on this matter.	12	2	5
160	 Your Grace, I--	12	2	5
161	 I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice.	12	2	5
162	 And I've never known you to hide from the truth.	12	2	5
163	 You've come to lecture me on truth?	12	2	5
164	 I've come to tell you that what I saw--	12	2	5
165	 All my brother's bannermen have come to my side.	12	2	5
166	 Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards.	13	2	5
167	 They won't be able to resist us now.	13	2	5
168	 Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne.	13	2	5
169	 Nothing is worth what this will cost you,	13	2	5
170	 - not even the Iron-- - I'll hear no more about it.	13	2	5
171	 Take a company of men, secure the perimeter.	13	2	5
172	 When do we sail for King's Landing?	13	2	5
173	 As soon as I've consolidated my troops.	13	2	5
174	 We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet.	13	2	5
175	 Once Blackwater Bay is cleared,	13	2	5
176	 we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city.	13	2	5
177	 And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?	13	2	5
178	 That's not your concern.	13	2	5
179	 If you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers.	13	2	5
180	 I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?	13	2	5
181	 Loyal service means telling hard truths.	13	2	5
182	 Oh, truth again.	13	2	5
183	 All right, what's the truth?	14	2	5
184	 The hard truth?	14	2	5
185	 She's a foreigner	14	2	5
186	 preaching her foreign religion.	14	2	5
187	 Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.	14	2	5
188	 What do you believe?	14	2	5
189	 You won those bannermen from Renly.	14	2	5
190	 Don't lose them to her.	14	2	5
191	 We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre.	14	2	5
192	 And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.	14	2	5
193	 Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea	14	2	5
194	 was spent evading ships, not attacking them.	14	2	5
195	 The other lords won't be happy.	14	2	5
196	 Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky	14	2	5
197	 I don't hang them for treason.	14	2	5
198	 Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos.	15	2	5
199	 I've got it! I've got it!	15	2	5
200	 So it's that one there at the top, on the right.	15	2	5
201	 Buy my fruit, My Lord. Fresh fruit.	15	2	5
202	 Stannis has more infantry,	15	2	5
203	 more ships, more horses.	15	2	5
204	 What do we have?	15	2	5
205	 There's that mind of yours you keep going on about.	15	2	5
206	 Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it.	15	2	5
207	 Good thing. I'd be out of a job.	15	2	5
208	 What about your father?	15	2	5
209	 He hasn't sent a raven in weeks.	15	2	5
210	 He's very busy.	15	2	5
211	 Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming.	15	2	5
212	 We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis,	16	2	5
213	 not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it.	16	2	5
214	 Corruption, yes.	16	2	5
215	 We are swollen, bloated, foul.	16	2	5
216	 Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of Kings	16	2	5
217	 and we're surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten?	16	2	5
218	 Yes, a rotten king.	16	2	5
219	 It's hard to argue with his assessment.	16	2	5
220	 Not after what he did to your birthday present.	16	2	5
221	 The King is a lost cause.	16	2	5
222	 It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.	16	2	5
223	 A dancing king, prancing down his bloodstained halls	16	2	5
224	 to the tune of a twisted demon monkey.	16	2	5
225	 You have to admire his imagination.	16	2	5
226	 - He's talking about you. - What?	16	2	5
227	 Demon monkey?	16	2	5
228	 People think you're pulling the King's strings.	16	2	5
229	 They blame you for the city's ills.	16	2	5
230	 Blame me? I'm trying to save them.	16	2	5
231	 You don't need to convince me.	17	2	5
232	 Demon monkey.	17	2	5
233	 ( Seagulls screeching	17	2	5
234	 Yeah, come on.	17	2	5
235	 You're the crew of the sea bitch?	17	2	5
236	 I'm your commander. Welcome.	17	2	5
237	 Stop.	17	2	5
238	 Stop!	17	2	5
239	 Your Captain commands you to stop.	17	2	5
240	 Where are we heading, Captain?	17	2	5
241	 The Stony Shore to raid their villages.	18	2	5
242	 There'll be spoils in it for you, and women,	18	2	5
243	 if you do your jobs well.	18	2	5
244	 And who decides if we've done our jobs well?	18	2	5
245	 I do.	18	2	5
246	 Your Captain.	18	2	5
247	 I have been reaving and raping	18	2	5
248	 since before you left Balon's balls, Captain.	18	2	5
249	 Don't reckon I've got much use for your ideas on how to do it.	18	2	5
250	 Don't reckon I've got much use for a captain at all.	18	2	5
251	 I'm thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself.	18	2	5
252	 All I need is a ship.	18	2	5
253	 You wouldn't know where I could find myself	18	2	5
254	 a ship now, would you?	18	2	5
255	 You could do that,	18	2	5
256	 take the ship, head out on your own.	18	2	5
257	 And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains,	18	2	5
258	 and hang you for a traitor.	19	2	5
259	 Stop. We yield.	19	2	5
260	 Congratulations on your first command.	19	2	5
261	 Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.	19	2	5
262	 Oh, I'm not here for you.	19	2	5
263	 I was just on my way to Red Harbor.	19	2	5
264	 I've got 30 ships. There's nowhere to put them here.	19	2	5
265	 - Too narrow. - You'd better get out there.	19	2	5
266	 Wouldn't want them to set sail without you.	19	2	5
267	 That would never happen.	19	2	5
268	 My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to.	19	2	5
269	 This lot, though...	19	2	5
270	 Enjoy the Stony Shore.	19	2	5
271	 Come on, I'll take you out.	19	2	5
272	 Who are you?	19	2	5
273	 Dagmer, your first mate.	19	2	5
274	 Why aren't you with the rest of them?	19	2	5
275	 Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea?	20	2	5
276	 That would be good for a laugh.	20	2	5
277	 They're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself.	20	2	5
278	 And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging	20	2	5
279	 piss-poor fishing villages?	20	2	5
280	 You're not.	20	2	5
281	 And yet that's the task my father has given me	20	2	5
282	 to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.	20	2	5
283	 They're all Iron Islanders.	20	2	5
284	 Do they do as they're told or do they do as they like?	20	2	5
285	 The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.	20	2	5
286	 The seat of the House of Tallhart--	20	2	5
287	 a more impressive prize than a few fishermen's daughters.	20	2	5
288	 What, you don't think we could take it?	20	2	5
289	 No, we could.	20	2	5
290	 We could never hold it for more than a few days.	20	2	5
291	 As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square,	20	2	5
292	 the Starks would send their men to take it back.	20	2	5
293	 And then--	20	2	5
294	 take me to my ship.	21	2	5
295	 The Starks have overextended their lines.	21	2	5
296	 Now that summer's over, they'll have a hard time	21	2	5
297	 keeping their men and horses fed.	21	2	5
298	 The Starks understand winter better than we ever will.	21	2	5
299	 The cold won't beat them.	21	2	5
300	 Our spies report growing discontent among the northern lords.	21	2	5
301	 They want to return home	21	2	5
302	 and gather the harvest before the crops turn.	21	2	5
303	 And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments,	21	2	5
304	 they would report growing discontent amongst the southern lords.	21	2	5
305	 This is war; No one's content.	21	2	5
306	 We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long.	21	2	5
307	 He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him.	21	2	5
308	 And as long as he keeps winning battles,	21	2	5
309	 they'll keep believing he is King in the North.	21	2	5
310	 You've been waiting for him to fail.	22	2	5
311	 He is not going to fail,	22	2	5
312	 not without our help.	22	2	5
313	 So how do we stop him?	22	2	5
314	 We've worked through the night, My Lord.	22	2	5
315	 Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep.	22	2	5
316	 As I think you would, Reginald.	22	2	5
317	 And because you're my cousin,	22	2	5
318	 I might even let you wake from that sleep.	22	2	5
319	 Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you.	22	2	5
320	 My wife's in Lannisport.	22	2	5
321	 Well, then you'd better start riding.	22	2	5
322	 Go before I change my mind and send her your head.	22	2	5
323	 If your name wasn't Lannister,	22	2	5
324	 you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent. Go!	22	2	5
325	 Not wine, water.	22	2	5
326	 We'll be here for some time.	22	2	5
327	 Girl.	23	2	5
328	 Where are you from?	23	2	5
329	 Maidenpool, My Lord.	23	2	5
330	 And who are the Lords of Maidenpool?	23	2	5
331	 - Remind me. - House Mooton, My Lord.	23	2	5
332	 And what is their Sigil?	23	2	5
333	 A red salmon.	23	2	5
334	 I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that.	23	2	5
335	 You're a northerner, aren't you?	23	2	5
336	 Good. One more time, where are you from?	23	2	5
337	 Barrowton, My Lord. House Dustin.	23	2	5
338	 Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown.	23	2	5
339	 And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?	23	2	5
340	 They call him the young wolf.	23	2	5
341	 And?	23	2	5
342	 They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant Direwolf.	23	2	5
343	 They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants.	24	2	5
344	 They say he can't be killed.	24	2	5
345	 And do you believe them?	24	2	5
346	 No, My Lord.	24	2	5
347	 Anyone can be killed.	24	2	5
348	 Fetch that water.	24	2	5
349	 A girl says nothing.	25	2	5
350	 A girl keeps her mouth closed.	25	2	5
351	 No one hears,	25	2	5
352	 and friends may talk in secret, yes?	25	2	5
353	 A boy becomes a girl.	25	2	5
354	 I was always a girl.	25	2	5
355	 And I was always aware.	25	2	5
356	 But the girl keeps secrets.	25	2	5
357	 It is not for a man to spoil them.	25	2	5
358	 You're one of them now.	25	2	5
359	 I should have let you burn.	25	2	5
360	 And you fetch water for one of them now.	25	2	5
361	 Why is this right for you and wrong for me?	26	2	5
362	 I didn't have a choice.	26	2	5
363	 You did. I did.	26	2	5
364	 And here we are.	26	2	5
365	 A man pays his debts.	26	2	5
366	 A man owes three.	26	2	5
367	 Three what?	26	2	5
368	 The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl.	26	2	5
369	 And only death may pay for life.	26	2	5
370	 You saved me and the two I was with.	26	2	5
371	 You stole three deaths from the Red God.	26	2	5
372	 We have to give them back.	26	2	5
373	 Speak three names	26	2	5
374	 and the man will do the rest.	26	2	5
375	 Three lives I will give you--	26	2	5
376	 no more, no less, and we're done.	26	2	5
377	 I can name anyone	27	2	5
378	 and you'll kill him?	27	2	5
379	 A man has said.	27	2	5
380	 The one who tortures everyone.	27	2	5
381	 A man needs a name.	27	2	5
382	 I don't know his name.	27	2	5
383	 They call him the Tickler.	27	2	5
384	 That is enough.	27	2	5
385	 Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty.	27	2	5
386	 He's not here yet.	27	2	5
387	 He'd have seen us, blown the horn.	27	2	5
388	 When will he come?	27	2	5
389	 The Halfhand does things in his own time.	27	2	5
390	 My uncle told me stories about him.	27	2	5
391	 Most of them are true.	27	2	5
392	 I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the wall.	27	2	5
393	 The whole winter.	27	2	5
394	 He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came.	28	2	5
395	 Had to wait for the thaw.	28	2	5
396	 So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.	28	2	5
397	 Well, possible for the Halfhand.	28	2	5
398	 Beautiful, isn't it?	28	2	5
399	 Gilly would love it here.	28	2	5
400	 There's nothing more sickening than a man in love.	28	2	5
401	 About time you did something.	28	2	5
402	 At least you'll keep warm.	28	2	5
403	 The fist of the First Men.	28	2	5
404	 Think of how old this place is--	29	2	5
405	 before the Targaryens defeated the Hendals,	29	2	5
406	 before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men.	29	2	5
407	 Before I die, please, stop talking.	29	2	5
408	 Thousands and thousands of years ago,	29	2	5
409	 the First Men stood here where we're standing	29	2	5
410	 all through the long night.	29	2	5
411	 What do you think they were like, the First Men?	29	2	5
412	 Stupid.	29	2	5
413	 Smart people don't find themselves in places like this.	29	2	5
414	 I think they were afraid.	29	2	5
415	 I think they came here to get away from something.	29	2	5
416	 And I don't think it worked.	29	2	5
417	 Wildlings?	29	2	5
418	 One blast is for rangers returning.	29	2	5
419	 Wildlings is two blasts.	29	2	5
420	 So you got to stand there waiting,	29	2	5
421	 wondering.	30	2	5
422	 One blast for friends,	30	2	5
423	 two for foes.	30	2	5
424	 And three for White Walkers.	30	2	5
425	 It's been 1,000 years,	30	2	5
426	 but that's the only time they blow the horn three times.	30	2	5
427	 But if it's been 1,000 years, how do you know?	30	2	5
428	 - Well... - I read it in a book.	30	2	5
429	 Look.	30	2	5
430	 It's Qhorin Halfhand.	30	2	5
431	 Aye, we'll live another day.	30	2	5
432	 Hurrah.	30	2	5
433	 Take care, My Lord.	30	2	5
434	 I remember reading an old sailor's proverb--	30	2	5
435	" ""piss on wildfire and your cock burns off."""	30	2	5
436	 Oh, I have not conducted this experiment.	31	2	5
437	 It could well be true.	31	2	5
438	 The substance burns so hot,	31	2	5
439	 it melts wood, stone, even steel,	31	2	5
440	 and, of course, flesh.	31	2	5
441	 The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow.	31	2	5
442	 After the dragons died, wildfire was the key	31	2	5
443	 to the Targaryen power.	31	2	5
444	 My companion takes issue.	31	2	5
445	 If I could tell you how many crazy old men	31	2	5
446	 I've seen pushing carts around army camps	31	2	5
447	 making grand claims about jars full of pig shit...	31	2	5
448	 - No offense meant. - Our order does not deal in pig shit.	31	2	5
449	 The substance is fire given form.	31	2	5
450	 And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor.	31	2	5
451	 To do what?	31	2	5
452	 The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.	31	2	5
453	 How much do you have?	32	2	5
454	 If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults,	32	2	5
455	 then maybe you'd hit your target one time in 10,	32	2	5
456	 but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father.	32	2	5
457	 My Lord, this man is insulting.	32	2	5
458	 I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man,	32	2	5
459	 but things can get a bit messy.	32	2	5
460	 'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis,	32	2	5
461	 he's flinging them right back at us.	32	2	5
462	 Men die, men shit themselves, men run,	32	2	5
463	 which means pots falling,	32	2	5
464	 which means fire inside the walls,	32	2	5
465	 which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city	32	2	5
466	 end up burning it down.	32	2	5
467	 My friend remains unconvinced.	32	2	5
468	 He would not dare insult my order	32	2	5
469	 whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.	32	2	5
470	 Well, he's not living anymore.	32	2	5
471	 And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they?	32	2	5
472	 Men win wars, not magic tricks.	32	2	5
473	 We have been working tirelessly day and night	33	2	5
474	 ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so.	33	2	5
475	 Our present count stands	33	2	5
476	 at 7,811,	33	2	5
477	 enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet	33	2	5
478	 and armies both.	33	2	5
479	 This is a shit idea.	33	2	5
480	 I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, wisdom Hallyne.	33	2	5
481	 The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low.	33	2	5
482	 You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer.	33	2	5
483	 You'll be making it for me.	33	2	5
484	 Dracarys.	34	2	5
485	 Dracarys.	34	2	5
486	 He'll be able to feed himself from now on.	34	2	5
487	 Let him sleep, Doreah.	34	2	5
488	 Yes, Khaleesi.	34	2	5
489	 He loves you.	34	2	5
490	 Thank you, my friend.	35	2	5
491	 Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you?	35	2	5
492	 They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.	35	2	5
493	 It is known.	35	2	5
494	 And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos--	35	2	5
495	 The last time a rich man gave me a dress,	35	2	5
496	 he was selling me to Khal Drogo.	35	2	5
497	 Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him.	35	2	5
498	 Men like to talk about other men	35	2	5
499	 when they're happy.	35	2	5
500	 You would look like a real princess in Xaro's--	35	2	5
501	 She's not a princess. She's a Khaleesi.	35	2	5
502	 You should wear it, Khaleesi.	36	2	5
503	 You are their guest.	36	2	5
504	 It would be rude not to.	36	2	5
505	 And you must visit the night market.	36	2	5
506	 The Qartheen night market is like no night market you've ever seen.	36	2	5
507	 It sounds wonderful.	36	2	5
508	 The Meereens think they have a night market.	36	2	5
509	 I will take you there myself.	36	2	5
510	 Please excuse me for a moment.	36	2	5
511	 What are they doing?	36	2	5
512	 Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry.	36	2	5
513	 Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot.	36	2	5
514	 They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold.	36	2	5
515	 Very soft. He can chop off as much as we can carry.	37	2	5
516	 My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do	37	2	5
517	 was steal things better men have built.	37	2	5
518	 It's not the only thing.	37	2	5
519	 They're quite good at killing the better men.	37	2	5
520	 That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.	37	2	5
521	 Mother of Dragons.	37	2	5
522	 On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth,	37	2	5
523	 I welcome you.	37	2	5
524	 A demonstration?	37	2	5
525	 Take this gem. Look at it.	38	2	5
526	 Into its depths.	38	2	5
527	 So many facets.	38	2	5
528	 Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them.	38	2	5
529	 Often more than once.	38	2	5
530	 Should you grow tired of Xaro's baubles and trinkets,	38	2	5
531	 it would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying.	38	2	5
532	 You're always welcome,	38	2	5
533	 Mother of Dragons.	38	2	5
534	 My apologies.	38	2	5
535	 Pyat Pree is one of the Thirteen.	38	2	5
536	 It was customary for me to extend him an invitation.	38	2	5
537	 Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.	38	2	5
538	 What is the House of the Undying?	38	2	5
539	 It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books	39	2	5
540	 and drink shade of the evening.	39	2	5
541	 It turns their lips blue and their minds soft--	39	2	5
542	 so soft, they actually believe	39	2	5
543	 their parlor tricks are magic.	39	2	5
544	 You watch over her.	39	2	5
545	 Do I know you?	39	2	5
546	 I know you.	39	2	5
547	 Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.	39	2	5
548	 Who are you?	39	2	5
549	 I'm no one.	39	2	5
550	 But she is the Mother of Dragons.	39	2	5
551	 She needs true protectors now more than ever.	39	2	5
552	 They shall come day and night	39	2	5
553	 to see the wonder born into the world again.	39	2	5
554	 And when they see, they shall lust,	39	2	5
555	 for dragons are fire made flesh.	39	2	5
556	 And fire is power.	39	2	5
557	 It looked like Stannis.	40	2	5
558	 To me it just looked like...	40	2	5
559	 A shadow in the shape of a man.	40	2	5
560	 In the shape of Stannis.	40	2	5
561	 We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.	40	2	5
562	 Will you stay there long, My Lady?	40	2	5
563	 Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen.	40	2	5
564	 After that, I will leave for Winterfell.	40	2	5
565	 My two youngest need me.	40	2	5
566	 I've been away from them for far too long.	40	2	5
567	 I never knew my mother.	40	2	5
568	 I'm sorry.	40	2	5
569	 My own mother died on the birthing bed	40	2	5
570	 when I was very young.	41	2	5
571	 It's a bloody business.	41	2	5
572	 What comes after is even harder.	41	2	5
573	 Once you're safely back amongst your own people,	41	2	5
574	 will you give me leave to go, My Lady?	41	2	5
575	 You mean to kill Stannis.	41	2	5
576	 I swore a vow.	41	2	5
577	 But Stannis has a great army around him.	41	2	5
578	 His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.	41	2	5
579	 I'm as good as any of them.	41	2	5
580	 I should never have fled.	41	2	5
581	 Renly's death was no fault of yours.	41	2	5
582	 You served him bravely.	41	2	5
583	 I only held him that once	41	2	5
584	 as he was dying.	41	2	5
585	 He's gone, Brienne.	41	2	5
586	 You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth.	41	2	5
587	 Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well.	42	2	5
588	 I do not know your son, My Lady...	42	2	5
589	 but I could serve you if you would have me.	42	2	5
590	 You have courage.	42	2	5
591	 Not battle courage, perhaps,	42	2	5
592	 but, I don't know,	42	2	5
593	 a woman's kind of courage.	42	2	5
594	 And I think that when the time comes,	42	2	5
595	 you will not hold me back.	42	2	5
596	 Promise me that you will not hold me back	42	2	5
597	 from Stannis.	42	2	5
598	 When the time comes, I will not hold you back.	42	2	5
599	 Then I am yours, My Lady.	42	2	5
600	 I will shield your back	43	2	5
601	 and give my life for yours if it comes to that.	43	2	5
602	 I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.	43	2	5
603	 I vow that you shall always have a place in my home	43	2	5
604	 and at my table	43	2	5
605	 and that I shall ask no service of you	43	2	5
606	 that might bring you dishonor.	43	2	5
607	 I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.	43	2	5
608	 And it's not just thieves, My Lord.	43	2	5
609	 There's wolves in them hills now,	43	2	5
610	 more than I've ever seen.	43	2	5
611	 They come down in the night and they kill my sheep.	43	2	5
612	 My three sons is away fighting for your brother, My Lord.	43	2	5
613	 They'll fight, keep fighting	43	2	5
614	 till they're told to go home.	43	2	5
615	 I have no one to man my flock now. Only me.	43	2	5
616	 I can't keep watch all day and all night.	43	2	5
617	 We can send two orphan boys from Winterstown home with you	44	2	5
618	 to help watch over your flock	44	2	5
619	 if you can give them room and board.	44	2	5
620	 My wife always prayed for more children.	44	2	5
621	 We'll look after them. Thank you, My Lord.	44	2	5
622	 And may the Gods bless you and yours.	44	2	5
623	 Stop it.	44	2	5
624	 If that's everyone, I'm going to go for a ride before dark.	44	2	5
625	 - Good. - Hodor.	44	2	5
626	 - Hodor. Bran-- Lord Stark.	44	2	5
627	 Torrhen's Square is under siege.	44	2	5
628	 Torrhen's Square is barely 40 leagues from here.	44	2	5
629	 How can the Lannisters strike so far north?	44	2	5
630	 Might be a raiding party led by the Mountain.	44	2	5
631	 Might be Sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.	44	2	5
632	 We have to help them.	44	2	5
633	 Most of the fighting men are away with Robb,	44	2	5
634	 but I can gather 200 decent men.	44	2	5
635	 Do you need so many?	44	2	5
636	 If we can't protect our own bannermen,	44	2	5
637	 why should they protect us?	44	2	5
638	 Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need.	45	2	5
639	 Won't take long, My Lord.	45	2	5
640	 Southerners don't do well up here.	45	2	5
641	 So, what does it mean?	45	2	5
642	 Ask your Maester Luwin.	45	2	5
643	 He's the one studying books all the time.	45	2	5
644	 I did ask him. He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.	45	2	5
645	 - Must not mean anything, then - You're lying.	45	2	5
646	 You might be a little lord, but don't you call me a liar.	45	2	5
647	 - You know what it means. - I never said I didn't.	45	2	5
648	 You didn't give me an honest answer.	45	2	5
649	 That's not the same as being a liar.	45	2	5
650	 Well, it's not far off.	45	2	5
651	 So, you've been dreaming of a three-eyed raven again?	45	2	5
652	 In the Godswood, you told me you didn't dream.	45	2	5
653	 Now who's a liar?	45	2	5
654	 What did you see in your dream?	46	2	5
655	 Something bad?	46	2	5
656	 Tell me, boy.	46	2	5
657	 I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell.	46	2	5
658	 I saw waves crashing against the gates	46	2	5
659	 and the water came flowing over the walls...	46	2	5
660	 flooded the castle.	46	2	5
661	 Drowned men were floating here	46	2	5
662	 in the yard.	46	2	5
663	 Ser Rodrik was one of them.	46	2	5
664	 The sea is hundreds of miles away.	46	2	5
665	 I know.	46	2	5
666	 It's just a stupid dream.	46	2	5
667	 I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen.	46	2	5
668	 Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.	46	2	5
669	 Osha.	46	2	5
670	 The three-eyed raven,	47	2	5
671	 what do they say about it	47	2	5
672	 north of the wall?	47	2	5
673	 They say all sorts of crazy things north of the wall.	47	2	5
674	 - There. - Where?	47	2	5
675	 On that Mountain.	47	2	5
676	 I don't see very well.	47	2	5
677	 A fire.	47	2	5
678	 There's a fire.	47	2	5
679	 The people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine.	47	2	5
680	 When they see us coming, that fire becomes a signal.	47	2	5
681	 Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time. to throw a party in our honor.	47	2	5
682	 How many wildlings have joined him?	47	2	5
683	 From what we can tell, all of them.	47	2	5
684	 Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves.	48	2	5
685	 They're almost ready to make their move.	48	2	5
686	 Where?	48	2	5
687	 Somewhere safe.	48	2	5
688	 Somewhere south.	48	2	5
689	 Can't just march into their midst.	48	2	5
690	 And we can't wait for them here with nothing but a pile	48	2	5
691	 of stones to protect us.	48	2	5
692	 You saying we should fall back to the Wall?	48	2	5
693	 Mance was one of us once.	48	2	5
694	 Now he's one of them.	48	2	5
695	 He's gonna teach them our way of doing things.	48	2	5
696	 They'll hit us in force.	48	2	5
697	 And they won't run away when we hit back.	48	2	5
698	 They're gonna be more organized than before,	48	2	5
699	 more disciplined	48	2	5
700	 more like us.	48	2	5
701	 So we need to be more like them,	48	2	5
702	 do things their way.	48	2	5
703	 Sneak in, kill Mance,	48	2	5
704	 and scatter them to the winds	48	2	5
705	 before they can march on the Wall.	48	2	5
706	 And to do that...	48	2	5
707	 We need to get rid of those lookouts.	49	2	5
708	 It's not a job for 400 men.	49	2	5
709	 I need to move fast and silent.	49	2	5
710	 Harker, Stonesnake, Borba.	49	2	5
711	 Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin.	49	2	5
712	 I've been called lots of things,	49	2	5
713	 but that might be my first Lord Qhorin.	49	2	5
714	 You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger.	49	2	5
715	 I've fought and killed a Wight.	49	2	5
716	 How many rangers can say that?	49	2	5
717	 He's the one?	49	2	5
718	 Aye. You killed a Wight.	49	2	5
719	 You also let an old man	49	2	5
720	 beat you bloody and take your sword.	49	2	5
721	 Craster?	49	2	5
722	 In the boy's defense, that's a tough old goat.	49	2	5
723	 I could take up Jon's duties while he's gone, My Lord.	49	2	5
724	 It would be no trouble.	49	2	5
725	 Well, I hope you make a better ranger	50	2	5
726	 than you do a steward.	50	2	5
727	 Go on.	50	2	5
728	 So, tell me,	50	2	5
729	 how long has your manservant been in love with you?	50	2	5
730	 He's not my manservant and he's not in love with me.	50	2	5
731	 He's my advisor,	50	2	5
732	 my friend.	50	2	5
733	 Unlikely.	50	2	5
734	 I can almost always tell what a man wants.	50	2	5
735	 And what about what a woman wants?	50	2	5
736	 Much more complicated.	50	2	5
737	 You, for example,	50	2	5
738	 what do you want?	50	2	5
739	 To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.	50	2	5
740	 Why?	50	2	5
741	 Because I promised my Khalasar I'd protect them	50	2	5
742	 and find them a safe home.	50	2	5
743	 You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms?	51	2	5
744	 I want them because they're mine by right.	51	2	5
745	 The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.	51	2	5
746	 Ah, a conqueror.	51	2	5
747	 And how did you get all of this?	51	2	5
748	 - Did someone give it to you? - No.	51	2	5
749	 I come from nothing.	51	2	5
750	 I hit the docks like a piece of cargo,	51	2	5
751	 except someone normally cares what happens to cargo.	51	2	5
752	 So you wanted more than you had and you took it.	51	2	5
753	 You're a conqueror, too. you're just less ambitious.	51	2	5
754	 Mmm.	51	2	5
755	 What do you want, Xaro Zhoan Daxos?	51	2	5
756	 At the gates of the city, you bled for me.	51	2	5
757	 Why?	51	2	5
758	 I will show you why.	51	2	5
759	 The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone.	51	2	5
760	 The hardest steel does not make a mark.	51	2	5
761	 I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth	52	2	5
762	 their weight in gold if they could break into it.	52	2	5
763	 I made the same offer to the greatest thieves.	52	2	5
764	 They all went home empty-handed.	52	2	5
765	 The only thing that can open this door	52	2	5
766	 is this key.	52	2	5
767	 And behind the door?	52	2	5
768	 And it can all be mine?	52	2	5
769	 All?	52	2	5
770	 Let us say half.	52	2	5
771	 More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies--	52	2	5
772	 enough to go home.	52	2	5
773	 All I have to do?	52	2	5
774	 Is marry me.	52	2	5
775	 That was a romantic proposal.	52	2	5
776	 I've already married once for love,	52	2	5
777	 but the Gods stole her from me.	52	2	5
778	 I come from nothing.	52	2	5
779	 My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes.	52	2	5
780	 But marry me and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms	53	2	5
781	 and our children will be Princes and Princesses.	53	2	5
782	 See?	53	2	5
783	 I have more ambition than you thought.	53	2	5
784	 The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen,	53	2	5
785	 first of your name.	53	2	5
786	 Robert Baratheon is dead.	53	2	5
787	 If you cross the sea with an army you bought--	53	2	5
788	 The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another.	53	2	5
789	 Four false kings destroying the country.	53	2	5
790	 To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros.	53	2	5
791	 The usurper is dead.	53	2	5
792	 The Starks fight the Lannisters,	53	2	5
793	 and Baratheons fight each other.	53	2	5
794	 According to your new friend	53	2	5
795	 who earned your trust by cutting his hand?	53	2	5
796	 The time to strike is now. We need to find ships and an army	53	2	5
797	 or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away	53	2	5
798	 at the edge of the world.	53	2	5
799	 Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get.	53	2	5
800	 They'll give you ships and soldiers and they'll own you forever.	54	2	5
801	 Moving carefully is the hard way, but it's the right way.	54	2	5
802	 And if I'd listened to that advice	54	2	5
803	 outside the gates of Qarth, we'd all be dead by now.	54	2	5
804	 I know the opportunity before you seems like the last you'll ever have,	54	2	5
805	 but you must--	54	2	5
806	 Do not speak to me like I'm a child.	54	2	5
807	 - I only want-- - What do you want?	54	2	5
808	 Tell me.	54	2	5
809	 To see you on the Iron Throne.	54	2	5
810	 - Why? - You have a good claim.	54	2	5
811	 A title. A birthright.	54	2	5
812	 But you have something more than that.	54	2	5
813	 You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart.	54	2	5
814	 You would not only be respected and feared,	54	2	5
815	 you would be loved.	54	2	5
816	 Someone who can rule and should rule.	54	2	5
817	 Centuries come and go without a person like that	54	2	5
818	 coming into the world.	54	2	5
819	 There are times when I look at you	54	2	5
820	 and still can't believe you're real.	54	2	5
821	 So what would you have me do as my advisor?	55	2	5
822	 Make your own way.	55	2	5
823	 Find your own ship. You only need one.	55	2	5
824	 The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth.	55	2	5
825	 And how do I get the ship?	55	2	5
826	 I'll find it for you.	55	2	5
827	 A sound ship with a good captain.	55	2	5
828	 I look forward to meeting him.	55	2	5
829	 Khaleesi.	55	2	5
830	 You should stand sideface.	56	2	5
831	 Sideface?	56	2	5
832	 Sideways.	56	2	5
833	 - Why? - Smaller target.	56	2	5
834	 Am I fighting someone?	56	2	5
835	 You're practicing for a fight.	56	2	5
836	 You should practice right.	56	2	5
837	 Guards!	56	2	5
838	 - Help. - Did you see anything?	56	2	5
839	 Go up there. Go and see where he fell from.	57	2	5
840	 Go up the back.	57	2	5
841	 That is strange.	57	2	5
842	 Move away.	57	2	5
843	 Stand back. He's dead.	57	2	5

10	 In the light of the Seven, I now proclaim Tommen	2	4	5
11	 of the House Baratheon First of His Name	2	4	5
12	 King of the Andals and the First Men	2	4	5
13	 and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.	2	4	5
14	 Long may he reign!	2	4	5
15	   Long may he reign!	2	4	5
16	 (cheering)	2	4	5
17	 Special day.	3	4	5
18	 (crowd chatting)	3	4	5
19	 Your Grace.	3	4	5
20	 Your Grace.	3	4	5
21	  Your Grace.  Your Grace.	4	4	5
22	 Your Grace.	4	4	5
23	 There he is.	4	4	5
24	 Long may he reign.	4	4	5
25	 Long may he reign.	4	4	5
26	 He sits the throne like he was born to it.	4	4	5
27	 Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?	4	4	5
28	 No, he wasn't.	4	4	5
29	 You still mourn for Joffrey?	4	4	5
30	 He was my husband. My king.	4	4	5
31	 He would have been your nightmare.	5	4	5
32	 Your Grace, I feel	5	4	5
33	 You knew exactly what he was.	5	4	5
34	 I did, too.	5	4	5
35	 You never love anything in the world	5	4	5
36	 the way you love your first child.	5	4	5
37	 Doesn't matter what they do.	5	4	5
38	 And what he did, it shocked me.	5	4	5
39	 Do you think I'm easily shocked?	5	4	5
40	 No.	5	4	5
41	 The things he did shocked me.	5	4	5
42	 He's only a boy.	5	4	5
43	 A good boy. A decent boy.	5	4	5
44	 He always has been.	5	4	5
45	 Who was the last decent king, I wonder?	5	4	5
46	 He could be the first man who sits on that throne	6	4	5
47	 in 50 years to actually deserve it.	6	4	5
48	 It would be some consolation, wouldn't it?	6	4	5
49	 For all the horror that put him there.	6	4	5
50	 He will need help...	6	4	5
51	 if he's going to rule well.	6	4	5
52	 He has you.	6	4	5
53	 A mother is not enough.	6	4	5
54	 You're still interested in being queen, I take it?	6	4	5
55	 Oh.	6	4	5
56	 After all that's happened	6	4	5
57	 it sounds strange, I know, but I am	6	4	5
58	 I haven't even given any thought to it,	6	4	5
59	 what comes next.	6	4	5
60	 It would be a great honor, of course.	6	4	5
61	 But I will have to speak to my father about it.	6	4	5
62	 Yes, speak to your father.	7	4	5
63	 I'll speak to mine.	7	4	5
64	 We may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon.	7	4	5
65	 (chuckles)	7	4	5
66	 I won't even know what to call you.	7	4	5
67	 Sister?	7	4	5
68	 Or Mother?	7	4	5
69	 Hmm.	7	4	5
70	 King Joffrey Baratheon is dead.	7	4	5
71	 Murdered at his own wedding.	7	4	5
72	  And we have taken the Meereenese navy, Your Grace.	7	4	5
73	 The Second Sons took the Meereenese navy.	7	4	5
74	 Who told you to take the navy?	7	4	5
75	 No one.	7	4	5
76	 So why did you do it?	7	4	5
77	 I heard you liked ships.	7	4	5
78	 How many ships?	8	4	5
79	 93, Your Grace.	8	4	5
80	 How many men can they carry?	8	4	5
81	 9,300, not counting sailors.	8	4	5
82	 Would that be enough to take King's Landing?	8	4	5
83	 The Lannisters have more.	8	4	5
84	   They've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years.	8	4	5
85	 They're tired, dispersed.	8	4	5
86	 And now their king is dead.	8	4	5
87	 8,000 Unsullied, 2,000 Second Sons	8	4	5
88	 sailing into Blackwater Bay	8	4	5
89	 and storming the gates without warning.	8	4	5
90	 It's hard to say. It could be enough.	8	4	5
91	 But we're not fighting to make you queen of King's Landing.	8	4	5
92	 10,000 men can't conquer Westeros.	8	4	5
93	 The old houses will flock to our queen	8	4	5
94	 when she crosses the Narrow Sea.	8	4	5
95	 The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win,	8	4	5
96	 as they always have.	8	4	5
97	 There's other news.	8	4	5
98	 From Yunkai.	8	4	5
99	 Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule,	9	4	5
100	 the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city.	9	4	5
101	 They've reenslaved the freedmen who stayed behind	9	4	5
102	 and sworn to take revenge against you.	9	4	5
103	 And in Astapor,	9	4	5
104	 the council you installed to rule over the city	9	4	5
105	 has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon	9	4	5
106	 who's declared himself His Imperial Majesty.	9	4	5
107	 Please leave me.	9	4	5
108	 Not you, Jorah.	9	4	5
109	 It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay	9	4	5
110	 isn't going quite as planned.	9	4	5
111	 You could sail for Westeros	10	4	5
112	 and leave it all behind.	10	4	5
113	 A boy sits on the Iron Throne.	10	4	5
114	 A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it.	10	4	5
115	 They've never been more vulnerable.	10	4	5
116	 You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth.	10	4	5
117	 I didn't listen.	10	4	5
118	 That all worked out well.	10	4	5
119	 (chuckles)	10	4	5
120	 How can I rule seven kingdoms	10	4	5
121	 if I can't control Slaver's Bay?	10	4	5
122	 Why should anyone trust me?	10	4	5
123	 Why should anyone follow me?	10	4	5
124	 You're a Targaryen.	10	4	5
125	 You're the Mother of Dragons.	10	4	5
126	 I need to be more than that.	10	4	5
127	 I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains.	11	4	5
128	 I will not sail for Westeros.	11	4	5
129	 What, then?	11	4	5
130	 I will do what queens do.	11	4	5
131	 I will rule.	11	4	5
132	 Pull up your hood.	12	4	5
133	 A memorable shade.	12	4	5
134	 But how would they know?	12	4	5
135	 You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most?	12	4	5
136	 Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.	12	4	5
137	 Is this the only way into the Eyrie?	12	4	5
138	 The mountains are impassable.	12	4	5
139	 If you want to get to the Eyrie,	12	4	5
140	 you need to go through the Bloody Gate.	12	4	5
141	 It doesn't matter how large your army is,	12	4	5
142	 if you attack this gate, you do it on this road,	12	4	5
143	 three men abreast	12	4	5
144	 and get slaughtered like goats.	12	4	5
145	 The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much,	12	4	5
146	 but they had these mountains	12	4	5
147	 and they knew how to use them.	12	4	5
148	 And the fortress they built here has never been overcome.	12	4	5
149	 Not once in 1,000 years.	12	4	5
150	 Know your strengths, use them wisely,	13	4	5
151	 and one man can be worth 10,000.	13	4	5
152	   Who would pass the Bloody Gate?	13	4	5
153	 Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece Alayne.	13	4	5
154	 Stand to.	13	4	5
155	  Stand to!  Stand to!	13	4	5
156	 Welcome back, Lord Baelish.	13	4	5
157	 (gate clanking)	13	4	5
158	 (door opens)	14	4	5
159	 Uncle Petyr!	14	4	5
160	   My lord.	14	4	5
161	 Oh.	14	4	5
162	 I have brought you a gift.	14	4	5
163	 Lord Baelish.	14	4	5
164	  My lady.  Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.	14	4	5
165	 A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.	14	4	5
166	 It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn.	14	4	5
167	 My name is Al	14	4	5
168	 Oh, do take down that hood, child.	14	4	5
169	 Don't you think know who you are?	14	4	5
170	 You think I'd let my intended	14	4	5
171	 leave the Eyrie on urgent business	14	4	5
172	 without knowing what that business was?	14	4	5
173	 I let him go so he could bring you here to me.	15	4	5
174	 My flesh and blood.	15	4	5
175	 It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa.	15	4	5
176	 You mustn't call me that in front of anyone else.	15	4	5
177	 Of course. I understand.	15	4	5
178	 No one can know you're here.	15	4	5
179	 It would put us in a very precarious position.	15	4	5
180	 I would never say a thing.	15	4	5
181	 The Lannisters want to destroy us.	15	4	5
182	 They've been trying for years.	15	4	5
183	 Now they know what it feels like.	15	4	5
184	 Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother's head.	15	4	5
185	 They did, and my father's.	15	4	5
186	 They killed my father, too, with poison.	15	4	5
187	 I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly,	15	4	5
188	 but Mother said I couldn't.	15	4	5
189	 Make him fly?	15	4	5
190	 Through the Moon Door.	15	4	5
191	 (giggles)	16	4	5
192	   And on top of everything else,	16	4	5
193	 they made you marry that filthy troll.	16	4	5
194	 They did. They made us both.	16	4	5
195	 Lord Tyrion didn't want to.	16	4	5
196	   I don't believe that for a moment.	16	4	5
197	 Did he force himself on you?	16	4	5
198	 No.	16	4	5
199	  We never   Good.	16	4	5
200	 Robin, this is your cousin Sansa.	16	4	5
201	 But you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone	16	4	5
202	 but Uncle Petyr and myself. Do you understand?	16	4	5
203	 Sansa, this is my son Robin.	16	4	5
204	 It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin.	16	4	5
205	 Robin, show Sansa to her chamber.	16	4	5
206	 Take the back stairs.	16	4	5
207	 Go. We'll speak soon.	16	4	5
208	 What took you so long?	16	4	5
209	 Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I,	17	4	5
210	 extricating Sansa, getting her here alive.	17	4	5
211	 She's here. We've spent more than enough time on her for one evening.	17	4	5
212	 Let's get married tonight.	17	4	5
213	 Ought we not...	17	4	5
214	 inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?	17	4	5
215	 There's only one Lord of the Vale.	17	4	5
216	 The others can all hang.	17	4	5
217	 Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards	17	4	5
218	 the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me.	17	4	5
219	 I do think that we could wait until	17	4	5
220	 I'm done waiting, Petyr.	17	4	5
221	 We had our wedding night many years ago.	17	4	5
222	 Or don't you remember?	17	4	5
223	 Like it was yesterday.	17	4	5
224	 What wife would do for you the things I've done for you?	17	4	5
225	 What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you?	17	4	5
226	 When you gave me those drops	17	4	5
227	 and told me to pour them into Jon's wine,	17	4	5
228	 my husband's wine	18	4	5
229	 when you told me to write a letter to Cat	18	4	5
230	 telling her it was the Lannisters	18	4	5
231	 (moans)	18	4	5
232	 The deed is done.	18	4	5
233	 Faded into nothing.	18	4	5
234	 Only speaking of it can make it real.	18	4	5
235	 Tonight it is, then.	18	4	5
236	 (laughs)	18	4	5
237	 Let me bathe and dress for the occasion.	18	4	5
238	 Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately.	18	4	5
239	 I'm warning you.	18	4	5
240	 I'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me.	19	4	5
241	 I'm going to scream so loud,	19	4	5
242	 they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea.	19	4	5
243	 (Lysa screaming)	19	4	5
244	 (grunting, moaning)	19	4	5
245	 (screaming)	19	4	5
246	 (moaning, screaming continues)	19	4	5
247	 When will the wedding take place in your mind?	19	4	5
248	 As soon as decency permits.	19	4	5
249	 After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother	19	4	5
250	 and Margaery to mourn her husband.	19	4	5
251	  A fortnight?  That seems reasonable.	19	4	5
252	 No jugglers, no jousting dwarves,	19	4	5
253	 no 77-course meals.	19	4	5
254	 And your wedding to Loras?	20	4	5
255	 Shortly after Tommen's.	20	4	5
256	  Shortly?  A fortnight.	20	4	5
257	 I know you don't like them.	20	4	5
258	 I didn't like your husband.	20	4	5
259	 Used to pat me on the back a lot.	20	4	5
260	 I didn't trust him.	20	4	5
261	 We had that in common.	20	4	5
262	 You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.	20	4	5
263	 Then whom can we trust?	20	4	5
264	 Ourselves alone.	20	4	5
265	 The Tyrells	20	4	5
266	 are our only true rivals	20	4	5
267	 in terms of resources	20	4	5
268	 and we need them on our side.	20	4	5
269	 Robert wasn't particularly rich.	20	4	5
270	 Robert had me funding him.	20	4	5
271	 Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.	20	4	5
272	 I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.	21	4	5
273	 Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?	21	4	5
274	 Haven't a clue.	21	4	5
275	 Go on, your best guess.	21	4	5
276	 Pounds, tons, ounces?	21	4	5
277	 Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.	21	4	5
278	 That can't be.	21	4	5
279	 Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.	21	4	5
280	 Then how do we pay for anything?	21	4	5
281	 The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos	21	4	5
282	 a tremendous amount of money.	21	4	5
283	 How much?	21	4	5
284	 A tremendous amount.	21	4	5
285	 There must be someone at the Iron Bank	21	4	5
286	 you can speak to, come to some arrangement.	21	4	5
287	 The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank.	21	4	5
288	 There is no someone.	21	4	5
289	 Someone does work there. It is comprised of people.	21	4	5
290	 And a temple is comprised of stones.	21	4	5
291	 One stone crumbles and another takes its place.	21	4	5
292	 And the temple holds its form for 1,000 years or more.	22	4	5
293	 That's what the Iron Bank is: a temple.	22	4	5
294	 We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it.	22	4	5
295	 You can't run from them. You can't cheat them.	22	4	5
296	 You can't sway them with excuses.	22	4	5
297	 If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself,	22	4	5
298	 you pay it back.	22	4	5
299	 Vesting the Tyrells in the crown	22	4	5
300	 will help a great deal in this respect.	22	4	5
301	 It's for the good of the family, I understand that.	22	4	5
302	 I'm not sure my brothers do.	22	4	5
303	 I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion.	22	4	5
304	 And as a mother, that is your right.	22	4	5
305	 But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you.	22	4	5
306	 I respect that.	23	4	5
307	 We don't need to discuss it.	23	4	5
308	 The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters.	23	4	5
309	 You've started wars to protect this family.	23	4	5
310	 Turned your back on Jaime	23	4	5
311	 for refusing to contribute to its future.	23	4	5
312	 What does Tyrion deserve	23	4	5
313	 for lighting that future on fire?	23	4	5
314	   Joffrey.	23	4	5
315	 Cersei.	23	4	5
316	 Walder Frey.	23	4	5
317	 Meryn Trant.	23	4	5
318	 Tywin Lannister.	23	4	5
319	 The Red Woman.	23	4	5
320	 Beric Dondarrion.	23	4	5
321	 Thoros of Myr.	24	4	5
322	 Ilyn Payne.	24	4	5
323	 The Mountain.	24	4	5
324	 Would you shut up?	24	4	5
325	 I can't sleep until I say the names.	24	4	5
326	 The names of every fucking person in Westeros?	24	4	5
327	 Only the ones I'm going to kill.	24	4	5
328	 (chuckles)	24	4	5
329	 Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going.	24	4	5
330	 Better than most.	24	4	5
331	 We come across my brother,	24	4	5
332	 maybe we can both cross a name off our list.	24	4	5
333	 If he were here right now, what would you do?	24	4	5
334	 I'd tell him to shut the fuck up	24	4	5
335	 so I can get some sleep.	24	4	5
336	 Go on, get it over with,	25	4	5
337	 your list of doomed men.	25	4	5
338	 I'm almost done.	25	4	5
339	 Only one name left.	25	4	5
340	 Go on.	25	4	5
341	 The Hound.	25	4	5
342	 Thank you.	25	4	5
343	 Your mother always had a sweet tooth, you know?	25	4	5
344	  Really?  Oh, yes.	25	4	5
345	 At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes,	25	4	5
346	 candied almonds, custard.	25	4	5
347	 Anything sweet.	25	4	5
348	 Eventually, your grandfather	25	4	5
349	 had to assign a septa to watch her at meals.	25	4	5
350	 Cat was the firstborn daughter after all.	25	4	5
351	 It was important that she remain desirable	25	4	5
352	 so Father could arrange a good match for her	26	4	5
353	 and she was starting to get fat.	26	4	5
354	 My mother fat?	26	4	5
355	 She never let me have my pudding	26	4	5
356	 until I'd finished all my proper food.	26	4	5
357	 This is before she married your father and moved to the North.	26	4	5
358	 By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers.	26	4	5
359	 Marriage changes people.	26	4	5
360	 I didn't mean for you to stop.	26	4	5
361	 Go on, enjoy them.	26	4	5
362	 How do you like them?	26	4	5
363	 They're delicious.	26	4	5
364	 Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.	26	4	5
365	 Oh, gods, no.	26	4	5
366	 Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing.	26	4	5
367	 He knew you liked lemon cakes.	26	4	5
368	 He's so kind.	26	4	5
369	 He really cares for you.	26	4	5
370	 Think where you'd be without him.	27	4	5
371	 In their clutches and tried for murder.	27	4	5
372	 Yes. I'm very lucky.	27	4	5
373	 He feels responsible for you.	27	4	5
374	 Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful.	27	4	5
375	 Why?	27	4	5
376	 Why does he feel responsible for you?	27	4	5
377	 Well, I'm half Tully.	27	4	5
378	  He loved your family so much.  Loved your mother.	27	4	5
379	  No.  That's what you wanted to say.	27	4	5
380	 He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you.	27	4	5
381	 Your mother never loved him. Never.	27	4	5
382	 Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing.	27	4	5
383	 The most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon.	27	4	5
384	 Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon.	27	4	5
385	 He almost killed Petyr in a duel.	27	4	5
386	 And your mother loved him anyway.	27	4	5
387	 And now Petyr is risking his life to save you,	27	4	5
388	 the daughter of a woman who didn't love him	27	4	5
389	 no more than those whores in his brothels.	27	4	5
390	  Has he told you about them?  No.	28	4	5
391	 He hasn't told you about the vile things they do with their bodies?	28	4	5
392	 The vile things they let him do with their bodies?	28	4	5
393	   No, never.  Are you pregnant?	28	4	5
394	 What? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never	28	4	5
395	 I wasn't asking about Tyrion.	28	4	5
396	 What have you let Petyr do with your body?	28	4	5
397	  Aunt Lysa, no, I  Your young, pretty body.	28	4	5
398	  Nothing. I'm a virgin.  Don't lie to me.	28	4	5
399	 You're hurting me.	28	4	5
400	 I'll know if you lie.	28	4	5
401	 I'm a virgin, I swear it.	28	4	5
402	 He loves you, Aunt Lysa.	28	4	5
403	 All he says is that I'm stupid.	28	4	5
404	 I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams	28	4	5
405	 who never learns and I'm a terrible liar,	28	4	5
406	 so I should always tell the truth.	28	4	5
407	 And I swear to you that he has never touched me.	28	4	5
408	  Not once, not ever.  Shh. Shh. Shh.	28	4	5
409	 It's all right.	28	4	5
410	 It will all be all right.	28	4	5
411	 You'll be a widow soon.	28	4	5
412	 They'll execute that dwarf for murdering the king	29	4	5
413	 and you'll be free to marry Robin.	29	4	5
414	 You'll be the Lady of the Vale.	29	4	5
415	 Hmm.	29	4	5
416	 (horse whinnies)	29	4	5
417	 (grunting)	29	4	5
418	 Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?	29	4	5
419	 Yes, my lady, when I was young.	29	4	5
420	 There wasn't much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though.	29	4	5
421	 He preferred litters.	29	4	5
422	 Perhaps you should have stayed with him.	29	4	5
423	 It's not going to be a pleasant journey for you.	29	4	5
424	 It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather.	30	4	5
425	 That's a long way off.	30	4	5
426	 Well, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black.	30	4	5
427	 If I were her, that's where I'd go.	30	4	5
428	 Feel free to stop at any point.	30	4	5
429	 Never, my lady. I'm your squire.	30	4	5
430	 I've made it this far in the world without a squire.	30	4	5
431	 I don't see why I need one now.	30	4	5
432	 All knights have squires, my lady.	30	4	5
433	 I'm not a knight.	30	4	5
434	 And I'm not a slaver, either. I don't own you.	30	4	5
435	 I swore an oath, my lady.	30	4	5
436	 I am releasing you from that oath.	30	4	5
437	 That means you could leave.	30	4	5
438	 I know.	30	4	5
439	 What do you think will happen if you leave?	30	4	5
440	 They'll say I wasn't a very good squire.	30	4	5
441	 (horse nickers)	30	4	5
442	 (whinnies)	30	4	5
443	  The hell you doing?  Practicing.	31	4	5
444	  What, ways to die?  No one's going to kill me.	31	4	5
445	 They will if you nance around like that.	31	4	5
446	 That's no way to fight.	32	4	5
447	 It's not fighting. It's water dancing.	32	4	5
448	 Dancing?	32	4	5
449	 Maybe you ought to put on a dress.	32	4	5
450	 Who taught you that shite?	32	4	5
451	 The greatest swordsman who ever lived.	32	4	5
452	 Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos.	32	4	5
453	 Braavos. (scoffs)	32	4	5
454	 Greasy-haired little bastard, I bet.	32	4	5
455	 They all are.	32	4	5
456	 What do you know about anything?	32	4	5
457	 I bet his hair is greasier than Joffrey's cunt.	32	4	5
458	  It was not.  Was? He dead?	32	4	5
459	  Yes.  How?	32	4	5
460	  He was killed.  Who by?	32	4	5
461	 Meryn Trant. That's why Ser Meryn	32	4	5
462	 Meryn Trant?	32	4	5
463	 The greatest swordsman who ever lived killed by Meryn fucking Trant?	32	4	5
464	  He was outnumbered.  Any boy whore with a sword	32	4	5
465	 could beat three Meryn Trants.	32	4	5
466	 Syrio didn't have a sword. Or armor. Just a stick.	32	4	5
467	 The greatest swordsman who ever lived didn't have a sword?	32	4	5
468	 (laughs)	32	4	5
469	 All right. You have a sword.	33	4	5
470	 Let's see what he taught you.	33	4	5
471	 Go on, do it for your Braavosi friend.	33	4	5
472	 Dead like all the rest of your friends.	33	4	5
473	 (grunts)	33	4	5
474	 Your friend's dead and Meryn Trant's not	33	4	5
475	 'cause Trant had armor	33	4	5
476	 and a big fucking sword.	33	4	5
477	 (scoffs)	33	4	5
478	 (bird calling)	33	4	5
479	 Your Grace.	34	4	5
480	 Prince Oberyn. Writing letters?	34	4	5
481	 A poem, actually.	34	4	5
482	 May I show you the gardens?	34	4	5
483	 I couldn't very well refuse a royal escort.	34	4	5
484	 No, you couldn't.	34	4	5
485	 I didn't realize you were a poet.	34	4	5
486	 Not a very good one.	34	4	5
487	 For your paramour?	34	4	5
488	 For one of my daughters.	34	4	5
489	 You have several, don't you?	34	4	5
490	 Eight.	34	4	5
491	 Eight?	34	4	5
492	 Eight daughters?	34	4	5
493	 The fifth is difficult.	34	4	5
494	 I named her after my sister Elia.	34	4	5
495	 Beautiful name.	34	4	5
496	 Yes.	34	4	5
497	 But I can't say it without turning sad.	34	4	5
498	 And after I turn sad,	35	4	5
499	 I grow angry.	35	4	5
500	 Perhaps that's why she's difficult.	35	4	5
501	 The gods love their stupid jokes, don't they?	35	4	5
502	 Which joke is that?	35	4	5
503	 You're a prince of Dorne.	35	4	5
504	 A legendary fighter.	35	4	5
505	 A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros.	35	4	5
506	 But you could not save your sister.	35	4	5
507	 I'm a Lannister. Queen for 19 years.	35	4	5
508	 Daughter of the most powerful man alive.	35	4	5
509	 But I could not save my son.	35	4	5
510	 What good is power	35	4	5
511	 if you cannot protect the ones you love?	35	4	5
512	 We can avenge them.	35	4	5
513	 Yes, we can avenge them.	35	4	5
514	 You really believe Tyrion murdered your son?	35	4	5
515	 I know he did.	35	4	5
516	 We will have a trial and we will learn the truth.	35	4	5
517	 We'll have a trial, anyway.	36	4	5
518	 I haven't seen my daughter in over a year.	36	4	5
519	 The last time I saw her,	36	4	5
520	 she was swimming with two of my girls in the Water Gardens.	36	4	5
521	 Laughing in the sun.	36	4	5
522	 I want to believe that.	36	4	5
523	 I want to believe she's happy.	36	4	5
524	 You have my word.	36	4	5
525	 We don't hurt little girls in Dorne.	36	4	5
526	 Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls.	36	4	5
527	 Would you bring her a gift for me?	36	4	5
528	 I wasn't there for her name day.	36	4	5
529	 I don't know when I'll see her again.	36	4	5
530	 Anything at all.	37	4	5
531	 The best shipwrights in King's Landing	37	4	5
532	 have been working on it for months.	37	4	5
533	 Myrcella loves the open water.	37	4	5
534	   I will have it sailed down to Sunspear for her.	37	4	5
535	 Please tell her...	37	4	5
536	 her mother misses her very much.	37	4	5
537	   Oh, no, no, no.	37	4	5
538	 No, no, no, no.	37	4	5
539	 Hells.	37	4	5
540	 Gods.	37	4	5
541	 Did you remove the skin?	37	4	5
542	 No, my lady.	38	4	5
543	 Have you ever cooked a rabbit before?	38	4	5
544	 No, my lady.	38	4	5
545	 Did you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion?	38	4	5
546	 No, my lady.	38	4	5
547	 That was the cooks.	38	4	5
548	 (groans)	38	4	5
549	 What are you doing?	38	4	5
550	 I'm helping you with your armor.	38	4	5
551	 I've been removing my own armor for quite some time, thank you very much.	38	4	5
552	 What exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion?	39	4	5
553	 I brought him his meals and cleared his table when he was finished.	39	4	5
554	 I kept his clothing and linens clean.	39	4	5
555	 Carried his messages and returned the replies.	39	4	5
556	 Mostly I poured wine.	39	4	5
557	 Oh.	39	4	5
558	 Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service,	39	4	5
559	 did you ever do anything remotely related to combat?	39	4	5
560	 I killed a man.	39	4	5
561	 Who?	39	4	5
562	 A Kingsguard.	39	4	5
563	 He tried to kill Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.	39	4	5
564	 How did you kill a Kingsguard?	39	4	5
565	 I pushed a spear through the back of his head.	40	4	5
566	 Bloody ridiculous.	40	4	5
567	 Help me with these straps.	40	4	5
568	  (woman whimpering)  (Rast laughing)	40	4	5
569	   Hey.	40	4	5
570	 Hey, get up.	40	4	5
571	  Get up.  (sobbing)	40	4	5
572	   That's it lad, put it inside.	41	4	5
573	 Get the fire going again. We're all freezing.	41	4	5
574	 Aye. What we need is a girl there.	41	4	5
575	 I've got to have a piss.	41	4	5
576	 (pigs grunting)	41	4	5
577	 (women whimpering)	41	4	5
578	 Now keep quiet.	41	4	5
579	 (rattles)	41	4	5
580	 (lantern squeaking)	41	4	5
581	 (coughs)	42	4	5
582	 You need water.	42	4	5
583	 It doesn't matter.	42	4	5
584	 Of course it matters.	42	4	5
585	 You mustn't let anything stop you.	42	4	5
586	 They already have stopped me.	42	4	5
587	 No.	42	4	5
588	 You're not here.	42	4	5
589	 You're far from here.	42	4	5
590	 What does that mean?	42	4	5
591	 (crows cawing)	42	4	5
592	 At the hill.	43	4	5
593	 A great weirwood tree.	43	4	5
594	 You've seen it, too.	43	4	5
595	 Meera and I, even Hodor,	43	4	5
596	 we're only here to guide you.	43	4	5
597	 He's waiting for you.	43	4	5
598	 We have to find it.	43	4	5
599	 You have to make it.	43	4	5
600	 We will.	43	4	5
601	 This  this isn't the end.	43	4	5
602	 Not for you.	43	4	5
603	 Not yet.	43	4	5
604	   How...	43	4	5
605	 will we know the end?	43	4	5
606	 You'll know.	44	4	5
607	 (footsteps)	44	4	5
608	   Brothers.	44	4	5
609	 You do move quiet.	44	4	5
610	  How many?  11 men.	44	4	5
611	 Most of them already drunk.	44	4	5
612	 No guards posted. They don't seem to have a care in the world.	44	4	5
613	 We'll carve them up like walnut pie.	44	4	5
614	 Karl was a top paid cutthroat in Flea Bottom.	44	4	5
615	 I've seen what he can do with a knife.	44	4	5
616	 Have you seen what I can do with a knife?	44	4	5
617	 (chuckles) Not yet.	44	4	5
618	 There's a hut on the west side of the keep. We should steer clear of it.	45	4	5
619	 Why?	45	4	5
620	 They've got some hounds chained up inside.	45	4	5
621	 Closer we can get without the dogs sniffing us, the better.	45	4	5
622	 New moon tonight.	45	4	5
623	 (sighs) Get some rest.	45	4	5
624	 We move at sundown.	45	4	5
625	 I've always liked a girl with curls.	45	4	5
626	 A touch of class.	45	4	5
627	 You take whatever's left.	45	4	5
628	 Get her up.	45	4	5
629	   Stop.	45	4	5
630	 Stop. What are you doing?	45	4	5
631	   Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.	45	4	5
632	 Stop. Stop!	45	4	5
633	  Hodor. Hodor.  Stop!	45	4	5
634	  Please.   Hodor.	45	4	5
635	  Please, get off her!  Hodor. Hodor.	46	4	5
636	 Please! Please, leave her alone!	46	4	5
637	   Please, stop. Stop.	46	4	5
638	   What are you doing? Leave her alone!   Hodor. Hodor.	46	4	5
639	   No!  Shh.	46	4	5
640	  Shh, shh, shh.  (gasping)	46	4	5
641	  Shh.  (whimpering)	46	4	5
642	 You've got pretty hair, don't you?	46	4	5
643	 Now what is a pretty little highborn girl like you	46	4	5
644	 doing out here in the deep, dark woods, eh?	46	4	5
645	 You left your daddy's castle looking for trouble, didn't you?	46	4	5
646	 No dresses for you.	46	4	5
647	 You like it rough, don't you?	46	4	5
648	 You like it in the gutter, don't you?	46	4	5
649	 If you let my sister go, I can help you.	46	4	5
650	 You can help me?	47	4	5
651	 I can.	47	4	5
652	 And how you gonna do that?	47	4	5
653	 I have the sight. I can see things.	47	4	5
654	 That's very helpful.	47	4	5
655	 Things that haven't happened yet.	47	4	5
656	 What a fine thing.	47	4	5
657	 A fine thing.	47	4	5
658	 Have you seen what I'm gonna do to your sister?	47	4	5
659	 Have you seen what they're going to do to your sister?	47	4	5
660	 No.	47	4	5
661	 Don't close your eyes.	47	4	5
662	 I saw you die tonight.	48	4	5
663	 I saw your body burn.	48	4	5
664	 I saw the snow fall and bury your bones.	48	4	5
665	   To arms!	48	4	5
666	 They're here, the Night's Watch.	48	4	5
667	 (men shouting)	48	4	5
668	 (woman screaming)	48	4	5
669	 (screams)	48	4	5
670	 Rescue party is here, lads.	49	4	5
671	 Lady.	49	4	5
672	  Is Jon with you?  Aye.	49	4	5
673	 I'll take you to him.	49	4	5
674	 You're Brandon Stark?	49	4	5
675	  (gasps)  Hodor. Hodor.	49	4	5
676	 The little crippled lord. We're going for a ride, boy.	49	4	5
677	 Jon! Jon!	49	4	5
678	 Keep talking and I'll cut your friends' throats.	49	4	5
679	 Starting with the idiot. Do you hear?	49	4	5
680	 Do you hear?	49	4	5
681	   Hodor! Hodor!	49	4	5
682	 Hodor. Hodor.	49	4	5
683	 Hodor. Hodor.	50	4	5
684	 Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.	50	4	5
685	 (grunting)	50	4	5
686	 (choking)	50	4	5
687	 (neck cracks)	50	4	5
688	 Hodor.	50	4	5
689	 Hodor, get his knife. Cut me loose.	51	4	5
690	   Hodor, get his knife.  Hodor.	51	4	5
691	 Cut me loose, Hodor.	51	4	5
692	 Jojen and Meera, free them.	51	4	5
693	 Go!	51	4	5
694	   (swords clanking)   (men shouting)	51	4	5
695	 Jon.	51	4	5
696	 Jon!	51	4	5
697	 If he sees you, he won't let you go north.	51	4	5
698	  He's my brother.  And wants to protect you.	51	4	5
699	 He'll take you back to Castle Black.	51	4	5
700	 You have to decide.	51	4	5
701	 Do you want to find the three-eyed raven?	52	4	5
702	   Hodor.   Hodor.	52	4	5
703	 We need to free Summer.	52	4	5
704	 And we need to go.	52	4	5
705	  (shouts)  (groans)	52	4	5
706	 Lord Snow.	52	4	5
707	 Are you bringing me back for trial?	52	4	5
708	 We had a good thing here.	52	4	5
709	 We were free men.	52	4	5
710	 You'll never be free.	52	4	5
711	 You'll never know what that's like.	53	4	5
712	 You learn how to fight in a castle?	53	4	5
713	 (groans)	53	4	5
714	 Some old man teach you how to stand,	53	4	5
715	 how to parry?	53	4	5
716	 (groans)	53	4	5
717	 How to fight with honor?	53	4	5
718	 You know what's wrong with honor?	54	4	5
719	 (spits)	54	4	5
720	 (grunts)	54	4	5
721	 You.	54	4	5
722	 (gurgling)	54	4	5
723	 (panting)	54	4	5
724	 Are you all right?	54	4	5
725	 Come with me.	54	4	5
726	 Come on.	55	4	5
727	 (grunts)	55	4	5
728	 We lost four brothers?	55	4	5
729	 Five.	55	4	5
730	 What the seven hells could do that to a man?	55	4	5
731	 I count 10 dead mutineers.	55	4	5
732	 Locke said there were 11 of them.	55	4	5
733	 Where's Rast?	55	4	5
734	 (wind howling)	55	4	5
735	 (panting)	55	4	5
736	 (crows cawing)	56	4	5
737	  (roaring)  (Rast screams)	56	4	5
738	  Here's another.  Jon.	56	4	5
739	   Where in seven hells?	56	4	5
740	 Come here.	56	4	5
741	 (whining)	56	4	5
742	 I missed you, boy.	56	4	5
743	 What should we do with this lot?	57	4	5
744	 It's not safe for you here on your own.	57	4	5
745	 Mance Rayder has an army heading this way	57	4	5
746	 and there's worse out there than Mance.	57	4	5
747	 Come with us to Castle Black.	57	4	5
748	 We can find you work. Keep you safe.	57	4	5
749	 Meaning all respect, Ser Crow,	57	4	5
750	 Craster beat us and worse.	57	4	5
751	 Your brother crows beat us and worse.	57	4	5
752	 We'll find our own way.	57	4	5
753	 You want to stay here	57	4	5
754	 in Craster's Keep?	57	4	5
755	 (spits)	57	4	5
756	 Burn it to the ground	57	4	5
757	 and all the dead with it.	57	4	5
758		58	4	5
759		0	4	5
0	 6 I've taken your castle.	2	2	6
1	 - Theon? - It's Prince Theon now.	2	2	6
2	 Get up. You have to get dressed.	2	2	6
3	 I've taken Winterfell.	3	2	6
4	 I took it. I'm occupying it.	3	2	6
5	 I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes.	3	2	6
6	 - Why? - To take the castle.	3	2	6
7	 - You went with Robb. - And he sent me back to Pyke.	3	2	6
8	 I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight for Robb and my father both.	3	2	6
9	 - Where's Hodor? - I don't know.	3	2	6
10	 Find the Halfwit.	3	2	6
11	 My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard.	3	2	6
12	 Why?	3	2	6
13	 So you and I can go down and tell them	3	2	6
14	 - how you've yielded Winterfell to me. - I won't.	3	2	6
15	 Yes, you will.	3	2	6
16	 I won't. I'll never yield.	3	2	6
17	 We'll fight you and throw you out.	3	2	6
18	 The castle is mine,	3	2	6
19	 but these people are still yours.	3	2	6
20	 You'll yield to keep them safe,	4	2	6
21	 to keep them alive.	4	2	6
22	 That's what a good lord would do.	4	2	6
23	 Think carefully about what you want to say.	4	2	6
24	 Theon.	4	2	6
25	 Did you hate us the whole time?	4	2	6
26	 I've yielded Winterfell to Theon.	4	2	6
27	 Louder.	4	2	6
28	 Say Prince Theon.	4	2	6
29	 I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon.	4	2	6
30	 You all know me.	4	2	6
31	 Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit.	4	2	6
32	 Farlen, you be silent.	4	2	6
33	 Listen to your little Lord, Farlen.	4	2	6
34	 He has more sense than you do.	4	2	6
35	 All of you should do as he commands.	4	2	6
36	 My father has donned the ancient crown of salt and rock	4	2	6
37	 and declared himself King of the Iron Islands.	5	2	6
38	 He claims the North as well by right of conquest.	5	2	6
39	 You are all his subjects.	5	2	6
40	 Bugger that. I serve the Starks.	5	2	6
41	 If you think you can hold the North with this...	5	2	6
42	 Shut up!	5	2	6
43	 If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark,	5	2	6
44	 I will be as good to you as he ever was.	5	2	6
45	 Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't.	5	2	6
46	 Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke	5	2	6
47	 informing my father of my victory here	5	2	6
48	 and one to Deepwood Motte to my sister.	5	2	6
49	 Inform her that she's to bring 500 men to Winterfell.	5	2	6
50	 You are a Maester of the Citadel	5	2	6
51	 sworn to serve the lord of Winterfell, are you not?	5	2	6
52	 I am.	5	2	6
53	 I am the Lord of Winterfell	5	2	6
54	 as Bran just informed you.	5	2	6
55	 Send the ravens.	6	2	6
56	 My Lord.	6	2	6
57	 My Lord Greyjoy.	6	2	6
58	 I see you've finally learned how to address your betters.	6	2	6
59	 What do you want?	6	2	6
60	 I was brought here a captive.	6	2	6
61	 You were here the day I was taken.	6	2	6
62	 I'm the one who took you. What of it?	6	2	6
63	 Let me serve you.	6	2	6
64	 Serve me how?	6	2	6
65	 I need fighters, not kitchen sluts.	6	2	6
66	 It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens.	6	2	6
67	 Put a spear in my hand again.	6	2	6
68	 So you can bury it in my neck?	6	2	6
69	 Do you take me for a fool?	6	2	6
70	 Get up.	6	2	6
71	 Step aside.	6	2	6
72	 Why?	6	2	6
73	 It's your dream, Little Lord.	6	2	6
74	 The ocean has come to swallow this place.	6	2	6
75	 I ain't letting it drown me.	7	2	6
76	 And in a few days' time... Greyjoy!	7	2	6
77	 What have they done to him?	7	2	6
78	 We caught this one on this way back from Torrhen's Square.	7	2	6
79	 Took out two of ours before I got his sword.	7	2	6
80	 Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes.	7	2	6
81	 It grieves me you've less honor than a back alley whore.	7	2	6
82	 You were raised here under this roof.	7	2	6
83	 - These people are your people. - They are not my people.	7	2	6
84	 King Robb thought of you as a brother.	7	2	6
85	 My brothers are dead.	7	2	6
86	 They died fighting Stark men, men like you.	7	2	6
87	 Aye, they died fighting a war your father started.	7	2	6
88	 Lord Stark raised you among his own sons.	7	2	6
89	 Among them, but not one of them.	7	2	6
90	 I was his hostage taken from my home.	7	2	6
91	 If he were alive to see this...	8	2	6
92	 He's not. He's dead.	8	2	6
93	 The Seven Kingdoms are at war.	8	2	6
94	 And Winterfell is mine.	8	2	6
95	 I should have put a sword in your belly	8	2	6
96	 instead of in your hand.	8	2	6
97	 You've served this House faithfully, old man.	8	2	6
98	 But keep talking and I'll...	8	2	6
99	 Take him to the cells. Lock him up...	8	2	6
100	 My prince,	8	2	6
101	 you cannot let that stand. He must pay.	8	2	6
102	 I'll lock him in a cell until he rots...	8	2	6
103	 No, he has to pay the iron price.	8	2	6
104	 They'll never respect you while he lives.	8	2	6
105	 Ser Rodrik,	8	2	6
106	 I sentence you to death.	9	2	6
107	 No! You said no harm would come to them if I yielded.	9	2	6
108	 The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.	9	2	6
109	 I urge you not to make a hasty decision.	9	2	6
110	 He disrespected me in front of my men.	9	2	6
111	 That was his decision, not mine.	9	2	6
112	 He is worth more to you alive than dead.	9	2	6
113	 The Starks will pay.	9	2	6
114	 Please, Theon,	9	2	6
115	 think what you do.	9	2	6
116	 You'll address me as Prince Theon	9	2	6
117	 or you'll be next.	9	2	6
118	 Come.	9	2	6
119	 No!	9	2	6
120	 - No! - Theon!	9	2	6
121	 Please!	9	2	6
122	 Ser Rodrik!	9	2	6
123	 He who passes the sentence should swing the sword.	9	2	6
124	 - I'm begging you! - Coward.	10	2	6
125	 Stop! Stop right now!	10	2	6
126	 You don't give commands anymore, Little Lord.	10	2	6
127	 - Please, stop this. Please stop him. - Hush now, child.	10	2	6
128	 I'm off to see your father.	10	2	6
129	 You said no harm would come!	10	2	6
130	 You said no harm would come. Theon, please.	10	2	6
131	 Any last words, old man?	10	2	6
132	 Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy.	10	2	6
133	 Now you are truly lost.	10	2	6
134	 Theon, please, don't.	10	2	6
135	 - Do something. - I'll do anything. Please!	10	2	6
136	 No, please, stop it!	10	2	6
137	 Ghost, stay with us.	11	2	6
138	 Ghost!	11	2	6
139	 There goes your pet.	11	2	6
140	 He's not a pet.	11	2	6
141	 You're right, he's not.	11	2	6
142	 You can't tame a wild thing.	11	2	6
143	 You can't trust a wild thing.	11	2	6
144	 - Ghost is different. - So you think.	11	2	6
145	 Wild creatures have their own rules,	11	2	6
146	 their own reasons.	11	2	6
147	 And you'll never know them.	11	2	6
148	 Now the wildlings we're looking for	11	2	6
149	 sleep during the day and hunt at night.	11	2	6
150	 I thought you said you couldn't know wild things.	11	2	6
151	 I said you can't.	11	2	6
152	 They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun's up	12	2	6
153	 and do their killing when it's dark.	12	2	6
154	 - We could do the same. - No, we couldn't.	12	2	6
155	 This is their country.	12	2	6
156	 They know where to walk, where not to walk.	12	2	6
157	 I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse	12	2	6
158	 they didn't see till they were in it.	12	2	6
159	 My father always said I'm of the North.	12	2	6
160	 - I wasn't joking. - Look around, boy.	12	2	6
161	 This look like home to you?	12	2	6
162	 You start thinking you know this place, it'll kill you.	12	2	6
163	 You understand me?	12	2	6
164	 No, you don't.	12	2	6
165	 We're at war.	12	2	6
166	 We've always been at war.	12	2	6
167	 It's never going to end 'cause we're not fighting an enemy.	12	2	6
168	 We're fighting the North and it's not going anywhere.	12	2	6
169	 The Watch has given you a great gift.	12	2	6
170	 You only have one thing to give in return...	12	2	6
171	 Your life.	13	2	6
172	 I'll gladly give my life.	13	2	6
173	 I don't want you to be glad about it.	13	2	6
174	 I want you to curse and fight	13	2	6
175	 until your heart's done pumping.	13	2	6
176	 And know this, boy...	13	2	6
177	 Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall.	13	2	6
178	 They'll never know what you've done.	13	2	6
179	 They'll never know how you died.	13	2	6
180	 They won't even know your damn name,	13	2	6
181	 but they'll be alive because some nameless bastard	13	2	6
182	 north of the Wall gave his life for theirs.	13	2	6
183	 Now, do you understand me?	13	2	6
184	 I do.	13	2	6
185	 You're even dumber than you look.	13	2	6
186	 It's just words, boy,	13	2	6
187	 to keep us a little warmer in the night,	13	2	6
188	 make us feel like we've got a purpose.	13	2	6
189	 Come on.	13	2	6
190	 We've got to find these goat fuckers before night falls	13	2	6
191	 and they find us.	13	2	6
192	 - Can you read? - My Lord?	14	2	6
193	 Can you read?	14	2	6
194	 This letter detailing our infantry movements	14	2	6
195	 was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand.	14	2	6
196	 It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.	14	2	6
197	 My apologies, My Lord. I must have...	14	2	6
198	" Girl, fetch me the ""History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses."""	14	2	6
199	 It's the one on the...	14	2	6
200	 My cupbearer can read better than you.	14	2	6
201	 To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance?	14	2	6
202	 My Lord, I...	15	2	6
203	 To the Starks of Winterfell!	15	2	6
204	 Who have 20,000 men and my son!	15	2	6
205	 I judged you might be good for something more	15	2	6
206	 than brutalizing peasants.	15	2	6
207	 I see I overestimated you.	15	2	6
208	 If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll...	15	2	6
209	 Leave us.	15	2	6
210	 Put the book away, girl.	15	2	6
211	 Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you're about it.	15	2	6
212	 - Lord Petyr Baelish. - Hmmm.	16	2	6
213	 Give us the room.	16	2	6
214	 Clear all this.	16	2	6
215	 - Lord Tywin. - Baelish.	16	2	6
216	 - Wine? - Thank you.	16	2	6
217	 What news from the capital?	16	2	6
218	 I travelled here directly from Renly Baratheon's camp.	16	2	6
219	 Ah, the late king Renly.	16	2	6
220	 Rather a short reign.	16	2	6
221	 Murdered by a woman, I hear.	16	2	6
222	 So they say.	16	2	6
223	 There has been talk of other forces at work,	16	2	6
224	 dark forces.	16	2	6
225	 Here.	17	2	6
226	 Men love to blame demons	17	2	6
227	 when their grand plans unravel.	17	2	6
228	 It is my belief that a moment of chaos	17	2	6
229	 affords opportunities lost soon after.	17	2	6
230	 You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it.	17	2	6
231	 Yes, a crisis is an opportunity.	17	2	6
232	 What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?	17	2	6
233	 After the Lannisters and the Starks,	17	2	6
234	 the Tyrells command the largest host.	17	2	6
235	 Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms,	17	2	6
236	 - feeding horses and soldiers. - Yes, yes, yes.	17	2	6
237	 The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings.	17	2	6
238	 Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly's death.	17	2	6
239	 And Margaery...	17	2	6
240	 Wants to be queen.	17	2	6
241	 Yes, she does.	17	2	6
242	 House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne,	17	2	6
243	 - against my grandson. - They did.	18	2	6
244	 And perhaps that treason should be punished	18	2	6
245	 one day,	18	2	6
246	 after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated.	18	2	6
247	 More wine for Lord Baelish.	18	2	6
248	 If you will allow me to represent your family's interests,	18	2	6
249	 I believe that an advantageous agreement...	18	2	6
250	 The Tyrell host has returned to Highgarden?	18	2	6
251	 They have.	18	2	6
252	 Pardon, My Lord.	18	2	6
253	 It's only wine.	18	2	6
254	 You would ride there yourself?	18	2	6
255	 Tonight, with your leave.	18	2	6
256	 I'll have an answer by nightfall.	18	2	6
257	 That'll be all, girl.	18	2	6
258	 What else?	19	2	6
259	 On your son Tyrion's directive,	19	2	6
260	 I met with Catelyn Stark.	19	2	6
261	 Why?	19	2	6
262	 He had an interesting proposal for her	19	2	6
263	 - concerning her daughters. - Hmm.	19	2	6
264	 - A girl. - A wildling.	20	2	6
265	 We could question her.	20	2	6
266	 You could.	20	2	6
267	 She won't answer.	20	2	6
268	 I've known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking.	20	2	6
269	 - What's your name? - Ygritte.	20	2	6
270	 She was reaching for this axe when you got to her.	20	2	6
271	 Give her half a chance, she'll bury it in your face.	20	2	6
272	 I gave you my name.	20	2	6
273	 I'm Jon Snow.	20	2	6
274	 You ought to burn them you killed.	20	2	6
275	 We'd need a big fire for that.	20	2	6
276	 Tell me, Ygritte,	20	2	6
277	 why do you want us to build a big fire?	21	2	6
278	 Are there some more friends in the area?	21	2	6
279	 Burn them or maybe you'll need those swords again.	21	2	6
280	 Our boy here's already killed one dead man.	21	2	6
281	 He can do it again if he has to.	21	2	6
282	 What waits beyond the pass?	21	2	6
283	 - The Free Folk. - How many?	21	2	6
284	 Hundreds and thousands.	21	2	6
285	 More than you've ever seen, Crow.	21	2	6
286	 Why come to the mountains?	21	2	6
287	 What's in the frostfangs your king could want?	21	2	6
288	 Do you mean to march on the Wall?	21	2	6
289	 Do you know who I am, girl?	21	2	6
290	 Qhorin Halfhand.	21	2	6
291	 Tell me true.	21	2	6
292	 If your people captured me,	22	2	6
293	 would they take me prisoner?	22	2	6
294	 They'd take your head off your shoulders	22	2	6
295	 if they was feeling kind.	22	2	6
296	 If not, they'd kill you slow.	22	2	6
297	 We have no food for her.	22	2	6
298	 Can't spare a man to watch her.	22	2	6
299	 Can't let her go. She'll bring Mance Rayder's army down on us.	22	2	6
300	 It needs to be done.	22	2	6
301	 - Want me to do it? - No.	22	2	6
302	 No, I'll do it.	22	2	6
303	 Come, brothers.	22	2	6
304	 We'll leave him to it.	22	2	6
305	 We'll meet you at the top.	22	2	6
306	 Don't take too long.	22	2	6
307	 We're deep in their country now.	22	2	6
308	 You never killed a woman before, did you?	23	2	6
309	 You don't need to do it.	23	2	6
310	 Mance would take you. I know he would.	23	2	6
311	 There's secret ways.	23	2	6
312	 The Crows would never catch us.	23	2	6
313	 I'm as much a Crow as they are.	23	2	6
314	 Will you burn me...	23	2	6
315	 after?	23	2	6
316	 Can't.	23	2	6
317	 Someone might see the smoke.	23	2	6
318	 Strike hard and true,	23	2	6
319	 Jon Snow,	23	2	6
320	 or I'll come back and haunt you.	23	2	6
321	 That's cold.	24	2	6
322	 Go on.	24	2	6
323	 Be quick about it.	24	2	6
324	 Do it.	24	2	6
325	 Bastard, do it!	24	2	6
326	 You can't do it. We both know it.	25	2	6
327	 The sun's going down, Jon Snow.	25	2	6
328	 And your friends are nowhere close.	26	2	6
329	 I'll find them.	26	2	6
330	 Call for the go on.	26	2	6
331	 Call loudly.	26	2	6
332	 May the Seven guide the princess on her journey.	26	2	6
333	 May the mother give her health.	26	2	6
334	 May the crone give her wisdom.	26	2	6
335	 May the warrior give her courage.	26	2	6
336	 One day I pray you love someone.	26	2	6
337	 I pray you love her so much,	26	2	6
338	 when you close your eyes, you see her face.	26	2	6
339	 I want that for you.	26	2	6
340	 I want you to know what it's like to love someone,	26	2	6
341	 to truly love someone,	26	2	6
342	 before I take her from you.	27	2	6
343	 You sound like a little cat mewling for his mother.	27	2	6
344	 Princes don't cry.	27	2	6
345	 - I saw you cry. - Did you say something, My Lady?	27	2	6
346	 My little brother cried when I left Winterfell.	27	2	6
347	 So?	27	2	6
348	 It seems a normal thing.	27	2	6
349	 Is your little brother a prince?	27	2	6
350	 No.	27	2	6
351	 Not really relevant, then, is it?	27	2	6
352	 Come, dog.	27	2	6
353	 Hail, Joffrey!	28	2	6
354	 Hail to the king.	28	2	6
355	 Seven blessings on you, Your Grace.	28	2	6
356	 Murderer! Bastard!	28	2	6
357	 All hail the king.	28	2	6
358	 He's no king. He's a bastard!	28	2	6
359	 Please, Your Grace, we're hungry.	28	2	6
360	 - Freak! - Get the prince back to the keep now.	28	2	6
361	 Yes, My Lord. Come, quickly.	28	2	6
362	 Please, Your Grace, give us some food!	28	2	6
363	 Bread, Your Grace, please!	28	2	6
364	 Who threw that?	28	2	6
365	 I want the man who threw that.	28	2	6
366	 Find who did that and bring him to me!	28	2	6
367	 - Hold on! - Hold them back!	28	2	6
368	 Just kill them! Kill them all!	28	2	6
369	 - Move. Move! - Pull back!	28	2	6
370	 Tear him to pieces!	28	2	6
371	 What are you doing? I want these people executed!	29	2	6
372	 And they want the same for you.	29	2	6
373	 Where's Sansa?	29	2	6
374	 Through the door!	29	2	6
375	 Come on!	29	2	6
376	 Protect the king!	29	2	6
377	 - Get back! - Fall back!	29	2	6
378	 - Move! - To the gates!	29	2	6
379	 - Come in! Come in! - Keep him safe!	30	2	6
380	 Motherfucker!	30	2	6
381	 - Watch out. Hold them back. - Come on.	30	2	6
382	 Hey!	30	2	6
383	 Traitors!	30	2	6
384	 I'll have all their heads.	30	2	6
385	 Oh, you blind, bloody fool.	30	2	6
386	 You can't insult me.	30	2	6
387	 We've had vicious kings and we've had idiot kings,	30	2	6
388	 but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with	30	2	6
389	 a vicious idiot for a king.	30	2	6
390	 - You can't... - I can, I am.	30	2	6
391	 They attacked me!	30	2	6
392	 They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all?	30	2	6
393	 They're starving, you fool.	30	2	6
394	 All because of a war you started.	30	2	6
395	 You're talking to a king!	30	2	6
396	 And now I've struck a king.	31	2	6
397	 Did my hand fall from my wrist?	31	2	6
398	 Where is the Stark girl?	31	2	6
399	 Let them have her.	31	2	6
400	 If she dies, you'll never get your Uncle Jaime back.	31	2	6
401	 You owe him quite a bit, you know.	31	2	6
402	 Where are you going?	31	2	6
403	 You ever been fucked, little girl?	31	2	6
404	 Come here.	31	2	6
405	 Take some men and go and find the Stark girl.	31	2	6
406	 I take my orders from the king.	31	2	6
407	 This way!	31	2	6
408	 Please!	31	2	6
409	 No, no.	31	2	6
410	 Please!	32	2	6
411	 You're all right now, little bird.	32	2	6
412	 You're all right.	32	2	6
413	 - We'll get you. We'll get you. - This way.	32	2	6
414	 Are you hurt, My Lady?	32	2	6
415	 The little bird's bleeding.	32	2	6
416	 Someone take her back to her cage,	32	2	6
417	 see to that cut.	32	2	6
418	 Well done, Clegane.	32	2	6
419	 I didn't do it for you.	32	2	6
420	 He shouldn't make me wait.	33	2	6
421	 The Spice King is the second wealthiest man in Qarth.	33	2	6
422	 He makes everyone wait.	33	2	6
423	 Of course, you could have avoided this embarrassment	33	2	6
424	 if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth.	33	2	6
425	 I already have a husband.	33	2	6
426	 Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi.	33	2	6
427	 You are far too young to be a widow forever	33	2	6
428	 and far too beautiful.	33	2	6
429	 And you are far too smart	33	2	6
430	 to think that I will succumb to flattery.	33	2	6
431	 I have travelled very far in my life	33	2	6
432	 and met many women,	33	2	6
433	 but none that are immune to flattery.	33	2	6
434	 - The Mother of Dragons! - Ah.	33	2	6
435	 Here he comes.	33	2	6
436	 Forgive me. I had terrible dreams last night.	33	2	6
437	 Terrible dreams.	33	2	6
438	 I could not sleep until the sun was shining	33	2	6
439	 and the birds were singing.	33	2	6
440	 Look what a beauty you are	34	2	6
441	 now the Red Waste has been washed off you.	34	2	6
442	 I am sorry about all that unpleasantness.	34	2	6
443	 The silver hair of a true Targaryen.	34	2	6
444	 Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely	34	2	6
445	 for a glorified dockworker like yourself.	34	2	6
446	 Very true, and yet they say that your grandfather,	34	2	6
447	 who sold pepper off the back of a wagon,	34	2	6
448	 married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself.	34	2	6
449	 Every lady alive was lovelier	34	2	6
450	 and higher born than my grandfather.	34	2	6
451	 Ahem.	34	2	6
452	 Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink?	34	2	6
453	 I'll have them flogged in the square.	34	2	6
454	 Thank you, My Lord. You are a gracious host,	34	2	6
455	 but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want.	34	2	6
456	 Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one.	34	2	6
457	 So, my little princess, what is it you want?	34	2	6
458	 My birthright...	34	2	6
459	 The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.	35	2	6
460	 I fear I'm no better than a servant in this regard.	35	2	6
461	 I cannot give you what I do not have.	35	2	6
462	 I'm not asking you for the Kingdoms.	35	2	6
463	 I'm asking you for ships.	35	2	6
464	 I need to cross the Narrow Sea.	35	2	6
465	 I need my ships as well.	35	2	6
466	 I use them, you see,	35	2	6
467	 to bring spices from one port to another.	35	2	6
468	 Whatever you grant me now will be repaid	35	2	6
469	 three times over when I retake the Iron Throne.	35	2	6
470	 Retake?	35	2	6
471	 Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?	35	2	6
472	 My father sat there before he was murdered.	35	2	6
473	 But if you did not sit on it yourself,	35	2	6
474	 would it not be correct to say take the Iron Throne?	35	2	6
475	 I didn't come here to argue grammar.	35	2	6
476	 Of course not. You came to take my ships.	35	2	6
477	 So let me explain my position,	35	2	6
478	 little princess.	35	2	6
479	 Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors.	35	2	6
480	 I make my living by trade.	35	2	6
481	 And I judge every trade on its merits.	35	2	6
482	 You ask for ships.	36	2	6
483	 You say I shall be repaid triple.	36	2	6
484	 I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions.	36	2	6
485	 But before you repay your debts,	36	2	6
486	 you must seize the Seven Kingdoms.	36	2	6
487	 - Do you have an army? - Not yet.	36	2	6
488	 You do not have an army.	36	2	6
489	 Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?	36	2	6
490	 There are many there that support my claim.	36	2	6
491	 When were you there last?	36	2	6
492	 I left when I was a baby.	36	2	6
493	 So, in truth, you have no allies.	36	2	6
494	 The people will rise to fight for their rightful.	36	2	6
495	 Queen when I return.	36	2	6
496	 Ah.	36	2	6
497	 Forgive me, little princess,	36	2	6
498	 but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams.	36	2	6
499	 Now if you'll pardon me.	36	2	6
500	 Do you know Illyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos?	36	2	6
501	 Yes, we've met. A shrewd man.	36	2	6
502	 For my wedding he gave me three petrified dragon eggs.	36	2	6
503	 He believed... The world believed...	36	2	6
504	 That the ages had turned them to stone.	36	2	6
505	 How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies?	37	2	6
506	 But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs	37	2	6
507	 into a great fire, they would hatch.	37	2	6
508	 When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad.	37	2	6
509	 But when the fire burned out,	37	2	6
510	 I was unhurt,	37	2	6
511	 the Mother of Dragons.	37	2	6
512	 Do you understand?	37	2	6
513	 I'm no ordinary woman.	37	2	6
514	 My dreams come true.	37	2	6
515	 I admire your passion.	37	2	6
516	 But in business, I trust in logic, not passion.	37	2	6
517	 I'm sorry, little princess.	37	2	6
518	 I am not your little princess.	37	2	6
519	 I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of old Valyria	37	2	6
520	 and I will take what is mine.	38	2	6
521	 With fire and blood, I will take it.	38	2	6
522	 Yes, My Lady, but not with my ships.	38	2	6
523	 Who taught you to read?	38	2	6
524	 My father, My Lord.	38	2	6
525	 Hmm.	38	2	6
526	 I taught my son Jaime to read.	38	2	6
527	 The Maester came to me one day,	38	2	6
528	 told me he wasn't learning.	38	2	6
529	 He couldn't make sense of the letters.	38	2	6
530	 He reversed them in his head.	38	2	6
531	 The Maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction	38	2	6
532	 and that we simply must accept it.	38	2	6
533	 Ha!	38	2	6
534	 After that, I sat Jaime down	39	2	6
535	 for four hours every day until he learned.	39	2	6
536	 He hated me for it, for a time.	39	2	6
537	 For a long time,	39	2	6
538	 but he learned.	39	2	6
539	 Where is your father? Is he alive?	39	2	6
540	 Who was he?	39	2	6
541	 A stonemason.	39	2	6
542	 A stonemason who could read?	39	2	6
543	 - Hmm. - He taught himself.	39	2	6
544	 Quite a man.	39	2	6
545	 What killed him?	39	2	6
546	 Loyalty.	39	2	6
547	 You're a sharp little thing, aren't you?	39	2	6
548	 Did...	40	2	6
549	 Forgive me, My Lord. I shouldn't ask questions.	40	2	6
550	 No...	40	2	6
551	 But you've already begun.	40	2	6
552	 Did you know your father, My Lord?	40	2	6
553	 I did.	40	2	6
554	 I grew up with him.	40	2	6
555	 I watched him grow old.	40	2	6
556	 He loved us.	40	2	6
557	 He was a good man,	40	2	6
558	 but a weak man,	40	2	6
559	 a weak man who nearly destroyed our House and name.	40	2	6
560	 I'm cold.	40	2	6
561	 I'll fetch more wood for the fire, My Lord.	40	2	6
562	 Mmm.	40	2	6
563	 Where are you going, girl?	41	2	6
564	 The armory, My Lord.	41	2	6
565	 Why?	41	2	6
566	 Lord Tywin sent me.	41	2	6
567	 What might this be?	41	2	6
568	 Lord Tywin gave it to me.	41	2	6
569	 What for?	41	2	6
570	 To take to the armory.	41	2	6
571	 Why would he do that?	41	2	6
572	 Let's go and ask him.	41	2	6
573	 Move!	41	2	6
574	 Get out of the way!	42	2	6
575	 Amory Lorch.	42	2	6
576	 A girl has named a second name.	42	2	6
577	 A man will do what must be done.	42	2	6
578	 Now!	42	2	6
579	 A girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing.	42	2	6
580	 A man cannot make a thing happen before its time.	42	2	6
581	 But he's going to tell Tywin. He's getting away.	42	2	6
582	 It has to be now.	42	2	6
583	 Guard!	43	2	6
584	 - Your Grace. - Your Grace.	43	2	6
585	 My honor, Your Grace.	43	2	6
586	 Your Grace.	43	2	6
587	 - Your Grace. - Quent.	43	2	6
588	 Lady Talisa.	44	2	6
589	 Your Grace.	44	2	6
590	 I'm not sure I'm a lady.	44	2	6
591	 Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me.	44	2	6
592	 It's hard to keep all the rules straight.	44	2	6
593	 But if I remember my lessons,	44	2	6
594	 a woman of noble birth is always called a lady	44	2	6
595	 unless she's a queen or a princess.	44	2	6
596	 I could find someone who knows.	44	2	6
597	 Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth?	44	2	6
598	 Because it's obvious.	44	2	6
599	 What if I told you my father sold lace on the long bridge	44	2	6
600	 and my mother, my brother, and I lived with him above our shop?	44	2	6
601	 I'd call you a liar.	44	2	6
602	 Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty.	44	2	6
603	 I always thought I was a brilliant liar.	44	2	6
604	 Better at amputations, I'm afraid.	44	2	6
605	 Quite a pretty spot.	45	2	6
606	 Will we be here long?	45	2	6
607	 I couldn't really discuss troop movements with you.	45	2	6
608	 I'm not a spy.	45	2	6
609	 Of course a spy would deny being a spy.	45	2	6
610	 You're right. You've found me out.	45	2	6
611	 I'm writing a letter to the Lannisters.	45	2	6
612	" ""The young wolf is on the move."""	45	2	6
613	 Perhaps you'd join me...	45	2	6
614	 If you've got time, of course, for, well...	45	2	6
615	 Robb.	45	2	6
616	 Mother.	45	2	6
617	 Mother, this is Lady Talisa.	45	2	6
618	 She's been helping with the wounded.	45	2	6
619	 She's been very... helpful.	45	2	6
620	 Lady Talisa.	45	2	6
621	 Lady Stark.	46	2	6
622	 Lady Talisa...?	46	2	6
623	 - Maegyr. - Maegyr?	46	2	6
624	 Forgive me, I do not know this name.	46	2	6
625	 An uncommon name here. An old name in Volantis.	46	2	6
626	 Excuse me, My Lady. Your Grace.	46	2	6
627	 I've missed you.	46	2	6
628	 Yes, you look positively forlorn.	46	2	6
629	 You surprised me, that's all.	46	2	6
630	 I didn't think I'd see you today.	46	2	6
631	 I wish that you were free to follow your heart.	46	2	6
632	 I know.	46	2	6
633	 You have inherited your father's responsibilities.	46	2	6
634	 I'm afraid they come at a cost.	46	2	6
635	 - I know. - You are promised to another...	46	2	6
636	 A debt that must be paid.	46	2	6
637	 - I haven't forgotten. - Your Grace.	47	2	6
638	 My Lady. News from Winterfell.	47	2	6
639	 Your brothers desert you?	47	2	6
640	 I can tell you which way to go.	47	2	6
641	 We'll stop here.	47	2	6
642	 Too dark to go any farther today.	47	2	6
643	 Here? There's no shelter here.	47	2	6
644	 There's no shelter anywhere.	47	2	6
645	 There is if you know where to look.	47	2	6
646	 The cold could kill us both.	47	2	6
647	 - If you light a fire... - No fire.	47	2	6
648	 - But a fire is... - No fire.	47	2	6
649	 Have it your way.	47	2	6
650	 We'll stay warmer if we stay close.	48	2	6
651	 Bet you freeze to death before I do.	48	2	6
652	 Bet your life.	48	2	6
653	 Think they're out looking for you?	48	2	6
654	 - Yes. - Think they'll find you?	48	2	6
655	 Yes.	48	2	6
656	 You're brave.	48	2	6
657	 Stupid,	49	2	6
658	 but brave.	49	2	6
659	 We start again at first light. Get some sleep.	49	2	6
660	 Stop moving.	49	2	6
661	 I'm just trying to get comfortable.	49	2	6
662	 Stop it!	49	2	6
663	 - You're still moving. - Was I?	49	2	6
664	 I didn't notice that time.	49	2	6
665	 This cannot be true.	50	2	6
666	 We've had ravens from White Harbor,	50	2	6
667	 Barrowton and the Dreadfort.	50	2	6
668	 I'm afraid it is true.	50	2	6
669	 Why? Why would Theon...	50	2	6
670	 Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.	50	2	6
671	 - My brothers? - We've heard nothing of them.	50	2	6
672	 But Rodrik Cassel is dead.	50	2	6
673	 I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!	50	2	6
674	 I must go North at once.	50	2	6
675	 There's still a war to win, Your Grace.	50	2	6
676	 How can I call myself king if I can't hold my own castle?	50	2	6
677	 How can I ask men to follow me if I can't...	50	2	6
678	 You are a king.	50	2	6
679	 And that means you don't have to do everything yourself.	50	2	6
680	 Let me go and talk to Theon.	50	2	6
681	 There will be no talk. He will die for this.	50	2	6
682	 Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew.	51	2	6
683	 Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort.	51	2	6
684	 He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon.	51	2	6
685	 We have the Lannisters on the run.	51	2	6
686	 If you march all the way back north now, you'll lose what you gained.	51	2	6
687	 My boy would be honored to bring you Prince Theon's head.	51	2	6
688	 Tell your son Bran and Rickon's safety is paramount.	51	2	6
689	 And Theon... I want him brought to me alive.	51	2	6
690	 I want to look him in the eye and ask him why.	51	2	6
691	 And then I'll take his head myself.	51	2	6
692	 Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you?	51	2	6
693	 I'm no liar.	51	2	6
694	 All wildlings are liars and savages	51	2	6
695	 with no loyalty to anything or anyone.	51	2	6
696	 I done what I had to do to stay alive.	51	2	6
697	 I hate the Starks as well as you do.	51	2	6
698	 Let me serve you, My Lord.	51	2	6
699	 How? And don't tell me to put a spear in your hand.	52	2	6
700	 There are other ways to serve, My Lord.	52	2	6
701	 I'm a prince now, and you'd do well...	52	2	6
702	 There are other ways to serve, my prince.	52	2	6
703	 Like what?	52	2	6
704	 We know things, the Free people.	52	2	6
705	 You know things?	52	2	6
706	 Like what?	52	2	6
707	 How to eat dirt?	52	2	6
708	 Other things.	52	2	6
709	 Savage things.	52	2	6
710	 Wait outside.	52	2	6
711	 I always wondered what you had under there.	53	2	6
712	 It comes at a price.	53	2	6
713	 I'm not killing you. That's your price.	53	2	6
714	 I already had that.	53	2	6
715	 What do you want, then,	53	2	6
716	 other than your miserable life?	53	2	6
717	 What all free people want...	53	2	6
718	 My freedom.	53	2	6
719	 Well, you shall have it, then.	53	2	6
720	 But only if you serve me well.	53	2	6
721	 - Ow. - Shh.	53	2	6
722	 - It's not deep. - I thought they were going to kill me.	53	2	6
723	 They thought so, too.	53	2	6
724	 He hated me, the man who hit me.	53	2	6
725	 I saw it in his eyes. Hated me.	53	2	6
726	 He never met me before,	53	2	6
727	 but he wanted to hurt me.	54	2	6
728	 - Of course he did. - Why? Why would a stranger...	54	2	6
729	 You are everything he will never have.	54	2	6
730	 Your horse eats better than his children.	54	2	6
731	 It doesn't matter now. He's dead.	54	2	6
732	 I would have given them bread if I had it.	54	2	6
733	 I hate the King more than any of them.	54	2	6
734	 Don't say these things.	54	2	6
735	 If the wrong people hear you...	54	2	6
736	 But you're not the wrong people.	54	2	6
737	 Don't trust anybody.	54	2	6
738	 Life is safer that way.	54	2	6
739	 And where are you going?	55	2	6
740	 I have something for you from Prince Theon.	55	2	6
741	 - What? - Me.	55	2	6
742	 He says I'm to make the rounds.	55	2	6
743	 And keep you warm.	55	2	6
744	 The Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment.	56	2	6
745	 The Silk King won't support me	56	2	6
746	 because of his business with the Lannisters.	56	2	6
747	 Why offend his best customer?	56	2	6
748	 And the Copper King offers me a single ship	56	2	6
749	 on the condition that I lie with him for a night.	56	2	6
750	 Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?	56	2	6
751	 When I came to this city, I had nothing.	56	2	6
752	 Truly nothing.	56	2	6
753	 I slept by the docks.	56	2	6
754	 And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat.	56	2	6
755	 If not, I dreamed of food.	56	2	6
756	 Today I am the richest man in Qarth.	56	2	6
757	 Do you think the path from poverty to wealth	56	2	6
758	 is always pure and honorable?	57	2	6
759	 I have done many things, Khaleesi,	57	2	6
760	 that a righteous man would condemn.	57	2	6
761	 And here I am, with no regrets.	57	2	6
762	 Bar the gates. Ring the bells.	57	2	6
763	 Slowly, Khaleesi.	57	2	6
764	 Where are they?	57	2	6
765	 Where are my dragons?!	57	2	6
0	 That's it. Get it right to the top.	0	6	7
1	 Steady. Steady.	0	6	7
2	 Up she goes.	0	6	7
3	 Hey, come on. Put your back into it, huh?	0	6	7
4	 Here you are, son.	1	6	7
5	 - Oh, gentlemen, please. - To my right.	1	6	7
6	 And you lot, come on. Come on, get it moving.	1	6	7
7	 Come on, come on.	1	6	7
8	 In all my days I've never seen a man swing an ax like that.	4	6	7
9	 How many men did it take to cut you down?	4	6	7
10	 Just one.	4	6	7
11	 He must have been some kind of monster.	4	6	7
12	 He was a woman.	4	6	7
13	 I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you.	5	6	7
14	 I'm used to it.	5	6	7
15	 When I found you, I thought you'd been dead for days.	5	6	7
16	 The way you were stinking already	5	6	7
17	 and you had bugs all over you	5	6	7
18	 and bone was coming through right there.	6	6	7
19	 I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed.	6	6	7
20	 Oh, nearly shit myself.	6	6	7
21	 I reckoned you were gonna die	6	6	7
22	 by the time I loaded you on the wagon, but you didn't.	6	6	7
23	 Now, I reckoned you'd die a dozen more times over the next few days,	6	6	7
24	 but you didn't. What kept you going?	6	6	7
25	 Hate.	6	6	7
26	 No, there's a reason you're still here.	6	6	7
27	 Aye, there's a reason. I'm a big fucker and I'm tough to kill.	6	6	7
28	 No, a reason.	6	6	7
29	 Gods aren't done with you yet.	6	6	7
30	 I've heard that before.	6	6	7
31	 Man was talking about a different god, though.	6	6	7
32	 Well, maybe he was right.	6	6	7
33	 I don't know much about the gods.	6	6	7
34	 You're in the wrong line of work.	6	6	7
35	 Oh, there's plenty of pious sons of bitches	7	6	7
36	 who think they know the word of god or gods.	7	6	7
37	 I don't. I don't even know their real names.	7	6	7
38	 Maybe it is the Seven. Or maybe it's the old gods.	7	6	7
39	 Or maybe it's the Lord of Light.	7	6	7
40	 Or maybe they're all the same fucking thing.	7	6	7
41	 I don't know.	7	6	7
42	 What matters, I believe,	7	6	7
43	 is that there's something greater than us.	7	6	7
44	 And whatever it is, it's got plans for Sandor Clegane.	7	6	7
45	 You didn't know me back in my time.	7	6	7
46	 You don't know the things I've done.	7	6	7
47	 I've heard stories.	7	6	7
48	 If the gods are real...	7	6	7
49	 why haven't they punished me?	7	6	7
50	 They have.	8	6	7
51	 Your Grace.	8	6	7
52	 What are we reading today?	8	6	7
53	 The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness.	8	6	7
54	 Chapter three, verse 12.	8	6	7
55	" Ah, ""As water rounds the stones, smoothing..."""	8	6	7
56	" ""Smoothing what was jagged, so does a woman's love"	8	6	7
57	 calm a man's brute nature.	8	6	7
58	 A wife salves her husband's wounds,	8	6	7
59	" a mother sings her son to sleep."""	8	6	7
60	 You learn quickly.	8	6	7
61	 There are some who know every verse of the sacred text,	8	6	7
62	 but don't have a drop of the Mother's mercy in their blood	9	6	7
63	 and savages who can't read at all	9	6	7
64	 who understand the Father's wisdom.	9	6	7
65	 For years I pretended	9	6	7
66	 to love the poor, the afflicted.	9	6	7
67	 I had pity for them, but I never loved them.	9	6	7
68	 They disgusted me.	9	6	7
69	 They are hard to love.	9	6	7
70	 The poor disgust us because they are us,	9	6	7
71	 shorn of our illusions.	9	6	7
72	 They show us what we'd look like without our fine clothes.	9	6	7
73	 How'd we smell without perfume.	9	6	7
74	 Can I ask you about a personal matter?	9	6	7
75	 Of course.	9	6	7
76	 The king mentioned that since your reunion,	10	6	7
77	 you haven't joined him in the marriage bed.	10	6	7
78	 No.	10	6	7
79	 You have a duty, Your Grace.	10	6	7
80	 To your husband, your king, your country,	10	6	7
81	 to the gods themselves.	10	6	7
82	 It's just...	10	6	7
83	 the desires that once drove me no longer do.	10	6	7
84	 Congress does not require desire	10	6	7
85	 on the woman's part, only patience.	10	6	7
86	 The king must have an heir	10	6	7
87	 if we are to continue our good work.	10	6	7
88	 Forgive me.	10	6	7
89	 Sometimes the true path is hard to find.	10	6	7
90	 Hard to find	10	6	7
91	 and harder still to walk upon.	10	6	7
92	 But you've made great progress.	10	6	7
93	 I only pray your grandmother follows your lead.	11	6	7
94	 My grandmother?	11	6	7
95	 Yes.	11	6	7
96	 The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman,	11	6	7
97	 a strong woman,	11	6	7
98	 and an unrepentant sinner.	11	6	7
99	 You must teach her the new way	11	6	7
100	 as she taught you the old.	11	6	7
101	 Or I fear for her safety,	11	6	7
102	 body and soul.	11	6	7
103	 Does it move or talk?	11	6	7
104	 I want to speak with you alone.	11	6	7
105	 Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor.	11	6	7
106	 Oh, this is madness!	11	6	7
107	 You're not in your sanctuary now, my dear.	12	6	7
108	 All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about...	12	6	7
109	 - Grandmother. - Until I tell them to stop.	12	6	7
110	 If I tell them to stop.	12	6	7
111	 - You could use a good bashing. - Grandmother, please.	12	6	7
112	 What have they done to you?	12	6	7
113	 You marched against the High Sparrow,	12	6	7
114	 - against the Faith. - We marched for you.	12	6	7
115	 The gods could have punished you and Father, but they didn't.	12	6	7
116	 - They showed mercy. - And what about your brother?	12	6	7
117	 What mercy did they show him?	12	6	7
118	 Loras's only hope is to confess his crimes and repent.	12	6	7
119	 If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden.	12	6	7
120	 He'll have to renounce his name and title...	12	6	7
121	 - Have you lost your mind? - And live his life as a penitent.	12	6	7
122	 He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell.	12	6	7
123	 He can begin again.	12	6	7
124	 As a mindless fanatic.	12	6	7
125	 As a free man.	12	6	7
126	 You will leave for Highgarden today.	13	6	7
127	 There is no law that says you must stay here.	13	6	7
128	 I am the queen.	13	6	7
129	 It is my duty to serve my husband the king.	13	6	7
130	 But you should leave, Grandmother.	13	6	7
131	 Your place is at home.	13	6	7
132	 I will never leave you. Never.	13	6	7
133	 You must.	13	6	7
134	 Go home.	13	6	7
135	 Find comfort in prayer and good works.	13	6	7
136	 The Mother watches over us all.	13	6	7
137	 I'll see you soon, my dear.	13	6	7
138	 Seven blessings to you, Grandmother.	14	6	7
139	 Shall we pray?	14	6	7
140	 We said we'd fight with you, King Crow,	14	6	7
141	 when the time comes and we meant it,	14	6	7
142	 but this isn't what we agreed to.	14	6	7
143	 These aren't white walkers.	14	6	7
144	 This isn't an army of the dead.	14	6	7
145	 This isn't our fight.	14	6	7
146	 If it weren't for him, none of us would be here.	14	6	7
147	 All of you would be meat in the Night King's army.	15	6	7
148	 And I'd be a pile of charred bones just like Mance.	15	6	7
149	 Remember Mance's camp?	15	6	7
150	 It stretched all the way to the horizon.	15	6	7
151	 And look at us now.	15	6	7
152	 Look what's left of us.	15	6	7
153	 And if we lose this, we're gone.	15	6	7
154	 Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations.	15	6	7
155	 Be like we were never there at all.	15	6	7
156	 We'll be the last of the free folk.	15	6	7
157	 That's what'll happen to you if we lose.	15	6	7
158	 The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers,	15	6	7
159	 they know you're here.	15	6	7
160	 They know that more than half of you are women and children.	15	6	7
161	 After they finish with me, they'll come for you.	15	6	7
162	 You're right.	15	6	7
163	 This isn't your fight.	15	6	7
164	 You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me.	16	6	7
165	 I shouldn't be asking you.	16	6	7
166	 It's not the deal we made.	16	6	7
167	 I need you with me if we're going to beat them,	16	6	7
168	 and we need to beat them if you're going to survive.	16	6	7
169	 The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk	16	6	7
170	 when no other southerners would.	16	6	7
171	 He died for us.	16	6	7
172	 If we are not willing to do the same for him, we're cowards.	16	6	7
173	 And if that's what we are,	16	6	7
174	 we deserve to be the last of the free folk.	16	6	7
175	 Snow.	17	6	7
176	 Are you sure they'll come?	18	6	7
177	 We're not clever like you southerners.	18	6	7
178	 When we say we'll do something, we do it.	18	6	7
179	 I heard you were leaving King's Landing.	18	6	7
180	 That is hardly your concern.	18	6	7
181	 Your grandson is still a prisoner.	18	6	7
182	 You'll leave him rotting in a cell?	18	6	7
183	 Loras rots in a cell because of you.	18	6	7
184	 The High Sparrow rules this city because of you.	18	6	7
185	 Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you	18	6	7
186	 and your stupidity.	18	6	7
187	 You're right.	19	6	7
188	 I made a terrible mistake.	19	6	7
189	 I carry it with me every single day.	19	6	7
190	 Good.	19	6	7
191	 I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep.	19	6	7
192	 And now we must fight them together.	19	6	7
193	 We need each other.	19	6	7
194	 I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met.	19	6	7
195	 At a certain age, it's hard to recall.	19	6	7
196	 But the truly vile do stand out through the years.	19	6	7
197	 Do you remember the way you smirked at me	19	6	7
198	 when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells?	19	6	7
199	 I do. I'll never forget it.	19	6	7
200	 You love your granddaughter.	19	6	7
201	 I love my son.	19	6	7
202	 It's the only truth I know.	19	6	7
203	 We must defend them.	20	6	7
204	 I'm leaving this wretched city as fast as I can	20	6	7
205	 before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells.	20	6	7
206	 If you're half as bright as you think you are,	20	6	7
207	 you'll find a way out of here, too.	20	6	7
208	 Never.	20	6	7
209	 I'll never leave my son.	20	6	7
210	 What'll you do, then?	20	6	7
211	 You have no support. Not anymore.	20	6	7
212	 Your brother's gone. The High Sparrow saw to that.	20	6	7
213	 The rest of your family have abandoned you.	20	6	7
214	 The people despise you.	20	6	7
215	 You're surrounded by enemies, thousands of them.	20	6	7
216	 You're going to kill them all by yourself?	20	6	7
217	 You've lost, Cersei.	20	6	7
218	 It's the only joy I can find in all this misery.	20	6	7
219	 Pick the pace up.	20	6	7
220	 Keep going.	21	6	7
221	 Keep it moving!	21	6	7
222	 Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege.	21	6	7
223	 Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches.	21	6	7
224	 Someone certainly does.	22	6	7
225	 Oh, no. Not me.	22	6	7
226	 I'm just an upjumped sellsword.	22	6	7
227	 You're an anointed knight. There's quite a difference.	22	6	7
228	 Aye, knights don't get paid.	22	6	7
229	 You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.	22	6	7
230	 That's like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.	22	6	7
231	 I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long.	22	6	7
232	 You can be the right hand I lost.	22	6	7
233	 You promised me a lordship and a castle	22	6	7
234	 and a highborn beauty for a wife.	22	6	7
235	 And you'll get all three. A Lannister always...	22	6	7
236	 Don't say it. Don't fucking say it.	22	6	7
237	 Come out and fight us, Blackfish.	23	6	7
238	 We have Lord Edmure.	23	6	7
239	 Yield the castle or we'll hang him.	23	6	7
240	 This is your last warning.	23	6	7
241	 Yield the castle.	23	6	7
242	 You think I won't do it, old man?	24	6	7
243	 I sliced your niece's throat from ear to ear.	24	6	7
244	 And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward.	24	6	7
245	 Yield the castle or I cut his throat.	24	6	7
246	 Go on, then. Cut his throat.	24	6	7
247	 Lothar, is it?	25	6	7
248	 Ser Jaime.	25	6	7
249	 We didn't know you were coming.	25	6	7
250	 'Cause you didn't set a proper perimeter.	25	6	7
251	 You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged.	25	6	7
252	 Good thing we're friends or we'd be fucking you in the ass right now.	25	6	7
253	 Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.	25	6	7
254	 Walder.	25	6	7
255	 Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.	25	6	7
256	 Only a fool makes threats he's not prepared to carry out.	25	6	7
257	 Now let's say I threatened to hit you	25	6	7
258	 unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking.	25	6	7
259	 - What do you think I'd do? - I don't give a rat's...	25	6	7
260	 I'm here by the king's command to take back this castle.	26	6	7
261	 Have him bathed and fed.	26	6	7
262	 Unless you'd like to take his place.	26	6	7
263	 Apologies, Ser Jaime.	26	6	7
264	 Do as he says.	26	6	7
265	 The siege is now under my command.	26	6	7
266	 The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts,	26	6	7
267	 he'll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is.	26	6	7
268	 Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches.	26	6	7
269	 Set pickets every hundred yards.	26	6	7
270	 And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.	26	6	7
271	 Those are our siege towers...	26	6	7
272	 As I said, the siege is under my command.	26	6	7
273	 If that's not to your liking, go home.	26	6	7
274	 Get word to the Blackfish.	26	6	7
275	 I want a parley.	26	6	7
276	 A parley or a fight?	26	6	7
277	 He's an old man.	26	6	7
278	 You've got one hand.	27	6	7
279	 My money's on the old boy.	27	6	7
280	 Lady Mormont.	27	6	7
281	 Welcome to Bear Island.	27	6	7
282	 I remember when you were born, my lady.	27	6	7
283	 You were named for my Aunt Lyanna.	27	6	7
284	 It was said she was a great beauty. I'm sure you will be, too.	27	6	7
285	 I doubt it. My mother wasn't a great beauty	27	6	7
286	 or any other kind of beauty.	27	6	7
287	 She was a great warrior, though.	27	6	7
288	 She died fighting for your brother Robb.	27	6	7
289	 I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna.	28	6	7
290	 He was also a great warrior and an honorable man.	28	6	7
291	 I was his steward. In fact...	28	6	7
292	 I think we've had enough small talk. Why are you here?	28	6	7
293	 Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black	28	6	7
294	 before he marched on Winterfell and was killed.	28	6	7
295	 He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men.	28	6	7
296	 - It said... - I remember what it said.	28	6	7
297	 Bear Island knows no king	28	6	7
298	 but the King in the North whose name is Stark.	28	6	7
299	 Robb is gone,	28	6	7
300	 but House Stark is not.	28	6	7
301	 And it needs your support now more than ever.	28	6	7
302	 I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance.	28	6	7
303	 As far as I understand, you're a Snow	29	6	7
304	 and Lady Sansa is a Bolton.	29	6	7
305	 Or is she a Lannister?	29	6	7
306	 I've heard conflicting reports.	29	6	7
307	 I did what I had to do to survive, my lady.	29	6	7
308	 But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark.	29	6	7
309	 If you say so. In any case,	29	6	7
310	 you don't just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men.	29	6	7
311	 Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady.	29	6	7
312	 It is our duty to stop him.	29	6	7
313	 Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner.	29	6	7
314	 What you have to understand, my lady, is that...	29	6	7
315	 I understand that I'm responsible for Bear Island and all who live here.	29	6	7
316	 So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else's war?	29	6	7
317	 If it please, my lady,	30	6	7
318	 I understand how you feel.	30	6	7
319	 I don't know you, Ser...?	30	6	7
320	 Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.	30	6	7
321	 You needn't ask your maester about my house.	30	6	7
322	 It's rather new.	30	6	7
323	 All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth.	30	6	7
324	 How is it you understand how I feel?	30	6	7
325	 You never thought you'd find yourself in your position.	30	6	7
326	 Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age.	30	6	7
327	 I never thought I'd be in my position.	30	6	7
328	 I was a crabber's son, then I was a smuggler.	30	6	7
329	 And now I find myself addressing the lady	30	6	7
330	 of a great house in time of war.	30	6	7
331	 But I'm here because this isn't someone else's war.	30	6	7
332	 It's our war.	31	6	7
333	 Go on, Ser Davos.	31	6	7
334	 Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont,	31	6	7
335	 made that man his steward.	31	6	7
336	 He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew	31	6	7
337	 he had the courage to do what was right,	31	6	7
338	 even if it meant giving his life.	31	6	7
339	 Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood	31	6	7
340	 that the real war isn't between a few squabbling houses.	31	6	7
341	 It's between the living and the dead.	31	6	7
342	 And make no mistake, my lady,	31	6	7
343	 the dead are coming.	31	6	7
344	 Is this true?	31	6	7
345	 Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men.	31	6	7
346	 I fought them at Hardhome.	31	6	7
347	 We both lost.	31	6	7
348	 As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided.	32	6	7
349	 And a divided North won't stand a chance against the Night King.	32	6	7
350	 You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand.	32	6	7
351	 But there's no hiding from this.	32	6	7
352	 We have to fight and we need to do it together.	32	6	7
353	 House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years.	32	6	7
354	 We will not break faith today.	32	6	7
355	 Thank you, my lady.	32	6	7
356	 How many fighting men can we expect?	32	6	7
357	 62.	33	6	7
358	 - 62? - We are not a large house,	33	6	7
359	 but we're a proud one.	33	6	7
360	 And every man from Bear Island	33	6	7
361	 fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders.	33	6	7
362	 If they're half as ferocious as their lady,	33	6	7
363	 the Boltons are doomed.	33	6	7
364	 Kingslayer.	35	6	7
365	 Blackfish.	35	6	7
366	 I assume you're here	35	6	7
367	 to fulfill the vow you gave my niece.	35	6	7
368	 I don't see Sansa and Arya.	35	6	7
369	 - I don't have them. - Pity.	35	6	7
370	 Do you wish to resume your captivity?	35	6	7
371	 Then why are you here?	35	6	7
372	 You know why I'm here.	35	6	7
373	 This castle belongs to House Frey.	35	6	7
374	 You're trespassing.	35	6	7
375	 In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or...	35	6	7
376	 Or you'll kill Edmure?	35	6	7
377	 My nephew's marked for death no matter what.	35	6	7
378	 Hang him and be done with it.	35	6	7
379	 It won't stop with Edmure.	35	6	7
380	 You'll force me to storm the castle.	35	6	7
381	 Hundreds will die.	35	6	7
382	 Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours.	35	6	7
383	 If you can breach the walls.	35	6	7
384	 We'll breach them and kill every last one of you.	36	6	7
385	 But if you surrender,	36	6	7
386	 I'll spare the lives of your men.	36	6	7
387	 On my honor.	36	6	7
388	 Your honor?	36	6	7
389	 Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.	36	6	7
390	 The war is over, ser.	36	6	7
391	 Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?	36	6	7
392	 As long as I'm standing, the war is not over.	36	6	7
393	 This is my home.	36	6	7
394	 I was born in this castle and I'm ready to die in it.	36	6	7
395	 So you can either attack	36	6	7
396	 or try to starve us out.	36	6	7
397	 We have enough provisions for two years.	36	6	7
398	 Do you have two years, Kingslayer?	37	6	7
399	 You clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives.	37	6	7
400	 Why did you come treat with me?	37	6	7
401	 Sieges are dull.	37	6	7
402	 And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you.	37	6	7
403	 Well, now you have.	37	6	7
404	 Aye, now I have.	37	6	7
405	 I'm disappointed.	37	6	7
406	 The answer is no.	37	6	7
407	 - Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out. - I've heard enough.	37	6	7
408	 We've only just taken back this castle from the ironborn.	37	6	7
409	 The Boltons helped us do it.	37	6	7
410	 Now you want me to fight against them?	37	6	7
411	 I could be skinned for even talking to you.	38	6	7
412	 The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton...	38	6	7
413	 Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?	38	6	7
414	 House Mormont.	38	6	7
415	 And?	38	6	7
416	 We sent ravens to Houses Manderly...	38	6	7
417	 I don't care about ravens.	38	6	7
418	 You're asking me to join your army.	38	6	7
419	 Who is fighting in this army?	38	6	7
420	 The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.	38	6	7
421	 Then the rumors are true.	38	6	7
422	 I didn't dare believe them.	38	6	7
423	 I received you out of respect for your father.	38	6	7
424	 Now I would like you to leave.	38	6	7
425	 House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home	38	6	7
426	 to fight alongside wildlings.	39	6	7
427	 - Lord Glover. - There's nothing else to say.	39	6	7
428	 I would remind you that House Glover	39	6	7
429	 is pledged to House Stark.	39	6	7
430	 Sworn to answer when called upon.	39	6	7
431	 Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries.	39	6	7
432	 We wept when we heard of your father's death.	39	6	7
433	 When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb's call	39	6	7
434	 and hailed him King in the North.	39	6	7
435	 And where was King Robb	39	6	7
436	 when the ironborn attacked this castle?	39	6	7
437	 When they threw my wife and children in prison	40	6	7
438	 and brutalized and killed our subjects?	40	6	7
439	 Taking up with a foreign whore.	40	6	7
440	 Getting himself and those who followed him killed.	40	6	7
441	 I served House Stark once,	40	6	7
442	 but House Stark is dead.	40	6	7
443	 Why did we have to come here?	41	6	7
444	 Some of us still like it.	41	6	7
445	 Have a drink at least.	41	6	7
446	 I don't want one.	41	6	7
447	 Don't go far, love.	41	6	7
448	 I'll find you in a bit.	42	6	7
449	 Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that.	42	6	7
450	 Doesn't interest you anymore?	42	6	7
451	 I'm sorry. I won't joke about it.	42	6	7
452	 I'll never hurt you, little brother.	42	6	7
453	 Don't you know that?	42	6	7
454	 You think Uncle Euron's hunting for us?	42	6	7
455	 Of course he is. As long as we're alive, we're a threat.	42	6	7
456	 He'll find us.	42	6	7
457	 It's a great big world and we have fast ships.	42	6	7
458	 Drink.	42	6	7
459	 I don't want any.	42	6	7
460	 I don't care what you want. Drink.	42	6	7
461	 Drink it all.	42	6	7
462	 You're ironborn, Theon. I know you've had some bad years.	43	6	7
463	 Some bad years?	43	6	7
464	 But I'm tired of watching you cower like a beat dog.	43	6	7
465	 Drink the goddamn ale.	43	6	7
466	 Now listen to me.	43	6	7
467	 I need you.	43	6	7
468	 The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender.	43	6	7
469	 Can you find him for me?	43	6	7
470	 Drink.	43	6	7
471	 You escaped. You hear me?	43	6	7
472	 You got away and you're never going back.	43	6	7
473	 We'll get justice for you.	43	6	7
474	 If I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell.	43	6	7
475	 Fuck justice, then. We'll get revenge. Drink.	43	6	7
476	 Listen to me.	43	6	7
477	 If you're so broken that there's no coming back,	43	6	7
478	 take a knife and cut your wrists.	44	6	7
479	 End it.	44	6	7
480	 But if you're staying, Theon, I need you.	44	6	7
481	 We're gonna sail to Meereen.	44	6	7
482	 We're gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen.	44	6	7
483	 And we're gonna take back the Iron Islands.	44	6	7
484	 Are you with me?	44	6	7
485	 Are you really with me?	44	6	7
486	 Now, since it's my last night ashore for a long while,	44	6	7
487	 I'm gonna go fuck the tits off this one.	45	6	7
488	 Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.	45	6	7
489	 And that's a good thing?	45	6	7
490	 He was the most experienced commander in Westeros.	45	6	7
491	 He chose this place for a reason.	45	6	7
492	 Those mountains are a natural fortification.	45	6	7
493	 There's a stream down there for the horses.	45	6	7
494	 We're not staying here long.	45	6	7
495	 Another storm could hit any day.	45	6	7
496	 Aye, the snows defeated Stannis	45	6	7
497	 as much as the Boltons did.	45	6	7
498	 We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.	45	6	7
499	 2,000 wildlings,	45	6	7
500	 200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins...	45	6	7
501	 62 Mormonts.	45	6	7
502	 It's not what we'd hoped for.	46	6	7
503	 But we still have a chance if we're careful and smart.	46	6	7
504	 For fuck's sake.	46	6	7
505	 So he's your most trusted advisor now?	46	6	7
506	 Because he secured 62 men from a 10-year-old?	46	6	7
507	 Ser Davos is the reason I'm standing here talking to you	46	6	7
508	 and he served Stannis for years.	46	6	7
509	 Stannis who lost the Blackwater,	46	6	7
510	 who murdered his own brother, who doesn't have a head?	46	6	7
511	 It's not enough. We need more men.	46	6	7
512	 There's no time.	46	6	7
513	 If we went down to Castle Cerwyn, I know that Lord...	46	6	7
514	 We fight with the army we have.	46	6	7
515	 Friends, this is not worth fighting over!	46	6	7
516	 This'll be it, now.	47	6	7
517	 Right, now we don't need to be fighting...	47	6	7
518	 - Who the fuck are you? - Hold on.	47	6	7
519	 Yeah, who the fuck are you?	47	6	7
520	 I was a soldier once.	48	6	7
521	 All my superiors thought I was brave.	48	6	7
522	 I wasn't. I mean, I never ran from a fight.	48	6	7
523	 Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid.	48	6	7
524	 That's all I was, a coward.	48	6	7
525	 We followed orders no matter the orders.	48	6	7
526	 Burn that village.	48	6	7
527	 Fine, I'm your arsonist.	48	6	7
528	 Steal that farmer's crops. Good, I'm your thief.	48	6	7
529	 Kill those young lads so they won't take up arms against us.	48	6	7
530	 I'm your murderer.	48	6	7
531	 I remember once a woman screaming at us,	48	6	7
532	 calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut.	48	6	7
533	 But we weren't animals.	48	6	7
534	 Animals are true to their nature	48	6	7
535	 and we had betrayed ours.	49	6	7
536	 I cut that young boy's throat myself	49	6	7
537	 as his mother screamed	49	6	7
538	 and my friends held her back.	49	6	7
539	 That night...	49	6	7
540	 I felt such shame.	49	6	7
541	 Shame was so heavy on me,	49	6	7
542	 I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep.	49	6	7
543	 All I could do was stare into that dark sky	49	6	7
544	 and listen to that mother screaming her son's name.	49	6	7
545	 I'll hear her screaming the rest of my life.	49	6	7
546	 Now, I know I can never bring that lad back.	49	6	7
547	 All I can do with time I've got left	49	6	7
548	 is bring a little goodness into the world.	50	6	7
549	 That's all any of us can do, isn't it?	50	6	7
550	 Never too late to stop robbing people,	50	6	7
551	 to stop killing people.	50	6	7
552	 Start helping people.	50	6	7
553	 It's never too late to come back.	50	6	7
554	 And it's not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers.	50	6	7
555	 It's not even about the gods. It's about you.	50	6	7
556	 Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself.	50	6	7
557	 Seven save you, friends.	50	6	7
558	 How can we help you?	50	6	7
559	 What are you doing here?	51	6	7
560	 Well, we're talking about life.	51	6	7
561	 You?	51	6	7
562	 Protecting the people.	51	6	7
563	 Well, we thank you for your protection.	51	6	7
564	 Who are you protecting us from?	51	6	7
565	 Do you have any horses?	51	6	7
566	 No horses.	51	6	7
567	 No gold. No steel.	51	6	7
568	 Food, then. Protecting the people is hungry work.	51	6	7
569	 I'm sure it is.	51	6	7
570	 You're welcome to stay for supper,	51	6	7
571	 but we have hungry mouths here.	51	6	7
572	 Stay safe.	51	6	7
573	 The night is dark and full of terrors.	51	6	7
574	" ""Seven save you, friends."""	52	6	7
575	 I'm a fucking septon. What was I supposed to say?	52	6	7
576	 They don't believe in your Seven.	52	6	7
577	 They're from the Brotherhood. They follow the Red God.	52	6	7
578	 Aye, well, all are welcome here.	52	6	7
579	 Anyway, we got nothing for them.	52	6	7
580	 Sure, you do. You've got food,	52	6	7
581	 you've got steel even if you say you don't.	52	6	7
582	 And you've got women.	52	6	7
583	 What do you want to do? Fight them?	52	6	7
584	 Kill them?	52	6	7
585	 It'd be you against all of them.	52	6	7
586	 I mean, these people don't know how to fight.	52	6	7
587	 You do.	52	6	7
588	 I'm done with fighting.	53	6	7
589	 Even if it's to protect yourself?	53	6	7
590	 Violence is a disease.	53	6	7
591	 You don't cure a disease by spreading it to more people.	53	6	7
592	 You don't cure it by dying, either.	53	6	7
593	 You've done enough work for one day.	53	6	7
594	 Come on up for some supper.	53	6	7
595	 It's gonna be a cold night.	53	6	7
596	 We'll need firewood.	53	6	7
597	 I'll save you a bowl of stew.	53	6	7
598	 Might even have some ale hidden away.	53	6	7

600	 He says the Iron Fleet's in Slaver's Bay.	53	6	7
601	 I'm inclined to believe him.	53	6	7
602	 I'm not going anywhere near those mad fuckers.	53	6	7
603	 You're Westerosi.	53	6	7
604	 What do you care?	54	6	7
605	 I want to book passage home.	54	6	7
606	 You? Can't afford it.	54	6	7
607	 Where'd you steal this from?	54	6	7
608	 Why do you care?	54	6	7
609	 We leave in two days.	54	6	7
610	 You can have a hammock in steerage.	54	6	7
611	 I want a cabin.	54	6	7
612	 And we'll leave at dawn.	54	6	7
613	 See you at sunrise.	54	6	7

6	 - Dozens of tents were-- - Horses?	3	5	9
7	 We're still getting a count, but hundreds are dead.	3	5	9
8	 20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?	3	5	9
9	 The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.	3	5	9
10	 Put last night's guards in chains.	3	5	9
11	 Either they fell asleep or they conspired with the enemy.	3	5	9
12	 - Find out the truth and then hang them. - Your Grace.	3	5	9
13	 Unless there's a thaw, we can't press forward to Winterfell	3	5	9
14	 and we don't have enough food to get us back to Castle Black.	3	5	9
15	 We're not returning to Castle Black.	4	5	9
16	 Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters,	4	5	9
17	 but if we can't march forward and we won't march back...	4	5	9
18	 Have the dead horses butchered for meat.	4	5	9
19	 Halt!	5	5	9
20	  Halt!	5	5	9
21	  There it is!	5	5	9
22	 Open the gates.	6	5	9
23	 It was a failure.	6	5	9
24	 It wasn't.	6	5	9
25	 I went to save them. I failed.	6	5	9
26	 You didn't fail him.	6	5	9
27	 Or him.	6	5	9
28	 Or her.	6	5	9
29	 Every one of them is alive because of you and no one else.	6	5	9
30	 I don't think that fact's lost on them.	6	5	9
31	 You have a good heart, Jon Snow.	7	5	9
32	 It'll get us all killed.	8	5	9
33	 Out of my way.	8	5	9
34	 You sent for me, Your Grace?	8	5	9
35	 Find some healthy horses and a few knights to guard you.	8	5	9
36	 I'm sending you back to Castle Black.	8	5	9
37	 Tell the Lord Commander his king commands him	8	5	9
38	 to send food, supplies, fresh horses.	8	5	9
39	 In return, when I take the throne,	8	5	9
40	 I'll make sure the Night's Watch has all the men it requires.	8	5	9
41	 He can guard all 19 castles on the Wall if he so wishes.	9	5	9
42	 Your Grace, you named me your Hand.	9	5	9
43	 Yes.	9	5	9
44	 The King's Hand should never abandon the king,	9	5	9
45	 especially in time of war.	9	5	9
46	 You're not abandoning me. You're obeying a command.	9	5	9
47	 A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.	9	5	9
48	 And if Jon Snow refuses the boy with the scroll,	9	5	9
49	 what does the boy say?	9	5	9
50	 I didn't name you Hand for your expertise in military matters.	9	5	9
51	 Ride for Castle Black. Don't come back empty-handed.	9	5	9
52	 Your Grace, perhaps Queen Selyse	9	5	9
53	 and Princess Shireen could accompany me.	9	5	9
54	 My family stays with me.	9	5	9
55	 At least let me take Shireen.	9	5	9
56	 A siege is no place for a little girl.	9	5	9

59	" ""The Dance of  A True Telling"""	10	5	9
60	 by Grand Maester Munkun.	10	5	9
61	 Now that sounds like a proper story.	10	5	9
62	 Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar.	10	5	9
63	 He polished his shield for a week so that it was like a mirror.	10	5	9
64	 And he crouched behind it and crept forward,	10	5	9
65	 hoping the dragon would only see its own reflection.	10	5	9
66	 But the dragon saw a dumb man holding a mirrored shield.	10	5	9
67	 And burnt him to a crisp.	11	5	9
68	 Thus ending the dragon-slaying career	11	5	9
69	 of Ser Byron Swann.	11	5	9
70	 I made you something, Princess.	11	5	9
71	 Do you like it?	11	5	9
72	 He's beautiful.	11	5	9
73	 - Thank you. - You're very welcome.	11	5	9
74	 Will you make me a doe, too? So that he can have company?	11	5	9
75	 Of course I will.	11	5	9
76	 But why am I getting a present?	11	5	9
77	 Because you deserve it.	11	5	9
78	 My son was always on me, trying to teach me to read.	11	5	9
79	 Gods, I was stubborn about it.	11	5	9
80	 Made it this far without reading.	11	5	9
81	 Seemed to me I could make it to the grave.	11	5	9
82	 Wish I'd listened to him.	11	5	9
83	 This is my own poor way of saying thank you.	12	5	9
84	 For teaching me to be a grown-up.	12	5	9
85	 I'll be gone for a few days, Princess.	12	5	9
86	" I want to hear all about ""The Dance of Dragons"" when I'm back."	12	5	9
87	 You'll read it yourself.	12	5	9
88	 Prince Doran.	12	5	9
89	 Forgive us. We started without you.	12	5	9
90	 Please, sit.	12	5	9
91	 Princess Myrcella.	12	5	9
92	 Uncle.	12	5	9
93	 What a lovely dress.	13	5	9
94	 - You don't like it? - You must be cold.	13	5	9
95	 Not at all. The Dornish climate agrees with me.	13	5	9
96	 Prince Trystane.	13	5	9
97	 How's your jaw?	13	5	9
98	 A fleabite.	13	5	9
99	 What are you doing in Dorne?	13	5	9
100	 Looking after the safety of my niece, the Princess Myrcella.	13	5	9
101	 And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly,	13	5	9
102	 you decided to enter my country in secret	13	5	9
103	 and abduct our guest by force?	13	5	9
104	 We received a threatening message.	13	5	9
105	 The princess's necklace in the jaws of a viper.	13	5	9
106	 That necklace was stolen from my room.	13	5	9
107	 Oh, excellent.	13	5	9
108	 A last meal before the beheading?	13	5	9
109	 Oh, I can't behead you.	13	5	9
110	 Many in Dorne want war.	13	5	9
111	 But I've seen war.	14	5	9
112	 I've seen the bodies piled on the battlefields.	14	5	9
113	 I've seen the orphans starving in the cities.	14	5	9
114	 I don't want to lead my people into that hell.	14	5	9
115	 No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters.	14	5	9
116	 And that is precisely what we are doing.	14	5	9
117	 Let us drink to Tommen, the First of His Name,	14	5	9
118	 King of the Andals and the First Men,	14	5	9
119	 Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.	14	5	9
120	 King Tommen insists	14	5	9
121	 on his sister's return to the capital?	14	5	9
122	 I'm afraid he does.	14	5	9
123	 I cannot disobey my king's command.	15	5	9
124	 She will return with you to King's Landing.	15	5	9
125	 And my son Prince Trystane will accompany you both.	15	5	9
126	 If the alliance between the Iron Throne and Dorne is to continue,	15	5	9
127	 their engagement must stand.	15	5	9
128	 I accept.	15	5	9
129	 One more thing. My brother was named	15	5	9
130	 to the small council before his death.	15	5	9
131	 Your father understood the importance	15	5	9
132	 of keeping Dorne in the fold.	15	5	9
133	 With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council.	15	5	9
134	 You have my word.	15	5	9
135	 The word of a kingslayer.	15	5	9
136	 No wonder you can't stand. You have no spine.	15	5	9
137	 You are mother to four of my nieces,	15	5	9
138	 girls I love very much.	15	5	9
139	 For their sake, I hope you live a long and happy life.	15	5	9
140	 Speak to me that way again, and you won't.	15	5	9
141	 May I inquire as to the fate of my man Bronn?	16	5	9
142	 Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King's Landing,	16	5	9
143	 how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?	16	5	9
144	 He said it was just a fleabite.	16	5	9
145	 The fault is mine.	16	5	9
146	 Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders.	16	5	9
147	 If anyone should be punished, it's me.	16	5	9
148	 Prince Trystane must learn judgment if he is to rule one day.	16	5	9
149	 I'll let him decide.	16	5	9
150	 I have learned the value of mercy from my father.	16	5	9
151	 -  I'll set your man free. - You're a good man.	16	5	9
152	 On one condition.	16	5	9
153	 Why do we play? I'm better than you.	17	5	9
154	 I'll always be better than you.	17	5	9
155	 Have I ever missed once?	17	5	9
156	 I don't think I have. I can't recall.	17	5	9
157	 You must love humiliation. Or pain.	17	5	9
158	 Which do you love most, humiliation or pain?	17	5	9
159	 That one hurt, didn't it?	17	5	9
160	 You going to cry?	17	5	9
161	 Give up, little sister.	17	5	9
162	 - You're going to miss. - Oh, I never miss.	17	5	9
163	 You will. You're thinking too much.	17	5	9
164	 Now you're nervous. What if she's right?	17	5	9
165	 - Luck. - Now it's my turn.	17	5	9
166	 You're too slow.	17	5	9
167	 You've always been too slow.	17	5	9
168	 Am I gonna be happy at the end of this walk?	18	5	9
169	 You'll find out very soon.	18	5	9
170	 Say it one more time, handsome.	18	5	9
171	 Who am I?	18	5	9
172	 The most beautiful woman in the world.	18	5	9
173	 And that's the truth.	18	5	9
174	 Slut.	18	5	9
175	 Prince Doran,	18	5	9
176	 Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.	18	5	9
177	 I didn't realize there were knights of the Blackwater.	18	5	9
178	 Only the one.	18	5	9
179	 I believe you've already met Prince Trystane.	18	5	9
180	 Prince.	18	5	9
181	 Sorry about the other day.	18	5	9
182	 Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy.	18	5	9
183	 He's agreed to grant you your freedom.	18	5	9
184	 I'm glad to hear it.	18	5	9
185	 Pie looks good.	18	5	9
186	 There was one condition.	19	5	9
187	 Perhaps some soup instead.	19	5	9
188	 Oysters, clams, and cockles.	19	5	9
189	 Oysters, clams, and cockles.	19	5	9
190	 Oysters, clams, and cockles.	19	5	9
191	 Oysters, clams, and cock--	19	5	9
192	 How much for your little clam?	19	5	9
193	 Oysters, clams, and cockles.	19	5	9
194	 Oysters, clams, and cockles.	19	5	9
195	 Come on.	20	5	9
196	 Some oysters, girl!	20	5	9
197	 I'm talking to you.	20	5	9
198	 Is, uh...	20	5	9
199	 - Girl! -  Tie her up!	20	5	9
200	 Are you deaf? Girl!	20	5	9
201	 Girl!	20	5	9
202	 My lord.	20	5	9
203	 My lord.	21	5	9
204	 Lord Tyrell.	21	5	9
205	 On behalf of the Iron Bank,	21	5	9
206	 may I be the first to welcome you	21	5	9
207	 to the Free City of Braavos.	21	5	9
208	 I hope your journey was trouble-free.	21	5	9
209	 A bit of chop the last few days.	21	5	9
210	 Nothing too awful.	21	5	9
211	 Good to see the old chap still guarding the harbor.	21	5	9
212	 And how goes the harvest in the Reach?	21	5	9
213	 Ah, the vintners say this might be	21	5	9
214	 the best year for red grapes in half a century.	21	5	9
215	 If we come to a satisfactory arrangement,	21	5	9
216	 I'll be sure to send a cask of the Arbor's finest your way.	21	5	9
217	 I'm afraid I don't partake.	21	5	9
218	 Oh.	21	5	9
219	 Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable.	21	5	9
220	 Pure nonsense, of course.	21	5	9
221	 I'm glad we see eye to eye on this matter.	22	5	9
222	 Did you know that at one point Maegor the third	22	5	9
223	 tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms?	22	5	9
224	 Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest	22	5	9
225	 and cut off both their hands.	22	5	9
226	 Most unfortunate for the glovers.	22	5	9
227	 If a man charges no interest on a loan,	22	5	9
228	 then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose,	22	5	9
229	 so why chance it?	22	5	9
230	 Whereas the promise of reward	22	5	9
231	 makes a man willing to gamble.	22	5	9
232	 We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell.	22	5	9
233	 You are the world's best gamblers.	22	5	9
234	 And all those bets you won built this.	22	5	9
235	 We should celebrate.	22	5	9
236	 I'm afraid I still have a good deal of work to do.	22	5	9
237	 Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?	22	5	9
238	 - I don't have that gift. - Oh, it's not a gift.	22	5	9
239	 It's a skill. Anyone can learn it.	23	5	9
240	 So give me a kiss by the Long Canal	23	5	9
241	 And give me two kisses in Salty Town	23	5	9
242	 For we're going to die tomorrow	23	5	9
243	 The bareheaded beggar, the king with his crown...	23	5	9
244	 Thought that old shit would never stop singing.	23	5	9
245	 Wasn't bad, though.	23	5	9
246	 The Tyrells can all rot in hell.	23	5	9
247	 Treasonous cunts.	23	5	9
248	 They were going to make that boy-fucker Renly king.	23	5	9
249	 This is the place, lads.	23	5	9
250	 The sleekest little minks in Braavos.	23	5	9
251	 - You buying? - Oh, I'm buying.	23	5	9
252	 But I never was good at sharing.	23	5	9
253	 Sell your fish somewhere else.	24	5	9
254	 Oh, let her in, Brusco. I'm hungry.	24	5	9
255	 Come here, sweetness.	24	5	9
256	 They say oysters get the juices flowing.	24	5	9
257	 We'll take half a dozen.	24	5	9
258	 Three coppers.	24	5	9
259	 Here's a silver because the lady likes you.	24	5	9
260	 Too old.	25	5	9
261	 Brea.	25	5	9
262	 Too old.	25	5	9
263	 I have just the one. Anara.	25	5	9
264	 Our most expensive girl.	25	5	9
265	 But well worth it, I assure you.	25	5	9
266	 Too old.	25	5	9
267	 Do you have what I want or not?	26	5	9
268	 Of course. Of course.	26	5	9
269	 These fresh?	26	5	9
270	 Come on, the lads are hungry.	26	5	9
271	 Nothing better for your cockstand than fresh oysters.	26	5	9
272	 - Here. Thank you. - I'll have one.	26	5	9
273	 Any vinegar?	26	5	9
274	 Who let this girl in? Shoo! Shoo!	26	5	9
275	 Good.	27	5	9
276	 I'll tell you when we're done.	27	5	9
277	 You'll have a fresh one for me tomorrow?	27	5	9
278	 Of course.	27	5	9
279	 I'll have you whipped, girl.	27	5	9
280	 Go, go on. Out, out, go.	27	5	9
281	 Valar morghulis.	27	5	9
282	 Valar morghulis.	28	5	9
283	 And?	28	5	9
284	 The thin man wasn't hungry today.	28	5	9
285	 Perhaps that is why a man is thin.	28	5	9
286	 Tomorrow.	28	5	9
287	 Tomorrow.	28	5	9
288	 A girl has work to do.	28	5	9
289	 Your rebellion is over.	28	5	9
290	 You can swear your allegiance to me now...	28	5	9
291	 or you can die.	29	5	9
292	 I believe in second chances.	29	5	9
293	 I don't believe in third chances.	29	5	9
294	 You write like a seven-year-old.	30	5	9
295	 Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.	30	5	9
296	 He didn't try to make you pay?	30	5	9
297	 Mm-mmm.	30	5	9
298	 Maybe he's changed.	30	5	9
299	 The queen will be thrilled to know you're bringing her daughter home.	30	5	9
300	 She will.	30	5	9
301	 You love her very much, don't you?	30	5	9
302	 Of course, she's my niece.	30	5	9
303	 I wasn't talking about her.	30	5	9
304	 You think I disapprove?	30	5	9
305	 Why?	30	5	9
306	 Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from?	30	5	9
307	 They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from.	30	5	9
308	 Here no one blinked an eye.	31	5	9
309	 100 years ago,	31	5	9
310	 no one would have blinked an eye at you	31	5	9
311	 if you'd been named Targaryen.	31	5	9
312	 It's always changing, who we're supposed to love and who we're not.	31	5	9
313	 The only thing that stays the same	31	5	9
314	 is that we want who we want.	31	5	9
315	 I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing	31	5	9
316	 that happened to the man I love.	31	5	9
317	 Perhaps even you are innocent of that.	31	5	9
318	 Father.	32	5	9
319	 Aren't you cold?	32	5	9
320	 No. What are you reading?	32	5	9
321	" - ""The Dance of Dragons."" - What's it about?"	32	5	9
322	 It's the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen	32	5	9
323	 and her half-brother Aegon for control over the Seven Kingdoms.	32	5	9
324	 Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne.	32	5	9
325	 When people started declaring for one of them or the other,	32	5	9
326	 their fight divided the kingdoms in two.	32	5	9
327	 Brothers fought brothers, dragons fought dragons.	32	5	9
328	 By the time it was over, thousands were dead.	32	5	9
329	 And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well.	32	5	9
330	 They never truly recovered.	32	5	9
331	" ""The Dance of Dragons."""	33	5	9
332	 Why is that a dance?	33	5	9
333	 It's just what they call it.	33	5	9
334	 Hmm, doesn't make much sense.	33	5	9
335	 I think it's poetic.	33	5	9
336	 If you had to choose	33	5	9
337	 between Rhaenyra and Aegon...	33	5	9
338	 who would you have chosen?	33	5	9
339	 I wouldn't have chosen either.	33	5	9
340	 It's all the choosing sides that made everything so horrible.	33	5	9
341	 Sometimes a person has to choose.	33	5	9
342	 Sometimes the world forces his hand.	33	5	9
343	 If a man knows what he is...	33	5	9
344	 and remains true to himself...	33	5	9
345	 the choice is no choice at all.	34	5	9
346	 He must fulfill his destiny...	34	5	9
347	 and become who he is meant to be.	34	5	9
348	 However much he may hate it.	34	5	9
349	 It's all right, Father.	34	5	9
350	 You don't even know what I'm talking about.	34	5	9
351	 It doesn't matter.	34	5	9

353	 Is there any way I can help?	34	5	9
354	 Yes, there is.	34	5	9
355	 Good. I want to.	34	5	9
356	 I'm the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon.	34	5	9
357	 And I'm your daughter.	34	5	9
358	 Forgive me.	35	5	9
359	 Where's my father? I want to see my father.	35	5	9
360	 It will all be over soon, Princess.	36	5	9
361	 No.	36	5	9
362	 Where's my father?	36	5	9
363	 No, you can't do this. Father, where are you?	36	5	9
364	 Please, let me see my father.	36	5	9
365	 Father, where are you? Don't let her do this.	36	5	9
366	 Please let go!	36	5	9
367	 Let me see my father! Where are you? Please!	36	5	9
368	 - It's what the Lord wants. - No.	36	5	9
369	 -  Please! Let go! No! - It's a good thing.	36	5	9
370	 - A great thing. -  Stop. Stop!	36	5	9
371	 - Please! - Hear us now, my Lord.	36	5	9
372	 - You can't do this! - For you, we offer up this girl	36	5	9
373	 - Please! -...that you may cleanse her with your fire	36	5	9
374	 and that its light may lead our way.	36	5	9

379	 Accept this token of our faith, my Lord,	37	5	9
380	 and lead us from the darkness.	37	5	9

386	 Lord of Light, protect us.	37	5	9
387	 - Please! Father, please! - For the night is dark and full of terrors.	37	5	9

409	nan	40	5	9
410	 They're waiting for you.	41	5	9
411	 Clap your hands.	41	5	9
412	 That one, the smaller man.	41	5	9
413	 No question, that's where you should put your money.	41	5	9
414	 The smaller man it is.	42	5	9
415	 I'm not putting my money anywhere.	42	5	9
416	 Kings and queens never bet on the games.	42	5	9
417	 Perhaps you should go find someone who does.	42	5	9
418	 People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits.	42	5	9
419	 He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake.	42	5	9
420	 I've spent much of my life in this arena.	42	5	9
421	 And in my experience, large men do triumph	42	5	9
422	 over smaller men far more often than not.	42	5	9
423	 Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting?	42	5	9
424	 You yourself?	42	5	9
425	 Have you ever tried to kill another man who was trying to kill you?	42	5	9
426	 Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one,	42	5	9
427	 the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then,	42	5	9
428	 then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me.	42	5	9
429	 They couldn't get their money out fast enough.	42	5	9
430	 But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here	42	5	9
431	 or... here.	42	5	9
432	 And the big men were always too slow	42	5	9
433	 to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren't.	42	5	9
434	 Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one standing across from me	43	5	9
435	 making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy.	43	5	9
436	 You don't approve?	43	5	9
437	 There's always been more than enough death in the world for my taste.	43	5	9
438	 I can do without it in my leisure time.	43	5	9
439	 Fair enough. Yet it's an unpleasant question,	43	5	9
440	 but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?	43	5	9
441	 It's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be,	43	5	9
442	 especially when what is has worked out in your favor.	43	5	9
443	 I'm not talking about myself.	43	5	9
444	 I'm talking about the necessary conditions for greatness.	43	5	9
445	 That is greatness?	43	5	9
446	 That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen,	43	5	9
447	 which existed long before you or I	43	5	9
448	 and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.	43	5	9
449	 My father would have liked you.	44	5	9
450	nan	44	5	9
451	 One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.	44	5	9
452	 - At your command? - If need be.	44	5	9
453	nan	44	5	9
454	 And how many people will die to make this happen?	44	5	9
455	 If it comes to that, they will have died for a good reason.	44	5	9
456	 Those men think they're dying for a good reason.	44	5	9
457	 Someone else's reason.	44	5	9
458	 So your reasons are true and theirs are false?	44	5	9
459	 They don't know their own minds, but you do?	44	5	9
460	 Well said. You're an eloquent man.	44	5	9
461	 Doesn't mean you're wrong.	44	5	9
462	 In my experience, eloquent men are right	44	5	9

36	 Your Grace, if you'd like to sit, I'm sure that...	5	4	6
37	 We've been here since midday.	5	4	6
38	 Easterners have a difference sense of time, I've often found.	5	4	6
39	 Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos.	5	4	6
40	 Together, we were going to run	5	4	6

42	 Welcome to the Iron Bank.	6	4	6
43	 Please, sit.	6	4	6
44	 What can we do for you, Lord Stannis?	6	4	6
45	 This is Stannis of the House Baratheon,	6	4	6
46	 King of the Andals and the First Men,	6	4	6
47	 Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.	6	4	6
48	 The Iron Throne is currently occupied	7	4	6
49	 by Tommen of the House Baratheon,	7	4	6
50	 King of the Andals and the First Men,	7	4	6
51	 Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.	7	4	6
52	 He shares no blood with me.	7	4	6
53	 He is a bastard born of incest.	7	4	6
54	 As was his brother before him.	7	4	6
55	 Yes, we have heard this story.	7	4	6
56	 It's not a story. It's the truth.	7	4	6
57	 The king's grandfather tells a different story.	7	4	6
58	 A story about a jealous uncle	7	4	6
59	 whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king	7	4	6
60	 cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold.	7	4	6
61	 Gold you loaned him.	7	4	6
62	 And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?	7	4	6
63	 More than any man living.	7	4	6
64	 Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled	7	4	6
65	" with words like ""usurper"" and ""madman"""	7	4	6
66	" and ""blood right."""	8	4	6
67	 Here, our books are filled with numbers.	8	4	6
68	 We prefer the stories they tell.	8	4	6
69	 More plain.	8	4	6
70	 Less open to interpretation.	8	4	6
71	 How many fighting men remain loyal to you?	8	4	6
72	 4,000.	8	4	6
73	 And how many ships do you have?	8	4	6
74	 The ones still afloat, Ser Davos,	8	4	6
75	 not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.	8	4	6
76	 32.	8	4	6
77	 And how much wheat and barley and beef	8	4	6
78	 and pork do you produce on Dragonstone	8	4	6
79	 to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships?	8	4	6
80	 None.	8	4	6
81	 You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up	8	4	6
82	 to a happy ending from our perspective.	8	4	6
83	 I'm afraid we must respectfully	8	4	6
84	 decline your request.	9	4	6
85	 But we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit.	9	4	6
86	 My lord.	9	4	6
87	 I'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth.	9	4	6
88	 You would not be either here.	9	4	6
89	 In Braavos,	9	4	6
90	 thieves are not rewarded with titles.	9	4	6
91	 Well, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving.	9	4	6
92	 That would be the pirates.	9	4	6
93	 I just moved what they stole from one place to another.	9	4	6
94	 This is the payment that was demanded	9	4	6
95	 by King Stannis for my crimes.	9	4	6
96	 I consider it an honest accounting.	9	4	6
97	 He's an honest man and he's your best chance	9	4	6
98	 to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros.	9	4	6
99	 Which is a lot, I imagine. Wars are expensive.	9	4	6
100	 The war is over.	9	4	6
101	 As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over.	10	4	6
102	 Who's the real power in King's Landing?	10	4	6
103	 - Ser Davos... - Humor me.	10	4	6
104	 -  Tywin Lannister. - How old is Tywin Lannister?	10	4	6
105	 - 67. - 67. And when he dies, who's in command?	10	4	6
106	 A half-grown boy,	10	4	6
107	 the product of incest?	10	4	6
108	 Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her?	10	4	6
109	 Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king	10	4	6
110	 he was sworn to protect?	10	4	6
111	 When Tywin's gone, who do you back?	10	4	6
112	 That is a problem for another time.	10	4	6
113	 Begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now.	10	4	6
114	 There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros.	10	4	6
115	 Stannis.	10	4	6
116	 He's got the birthright.	10	4	6
117	 He's in his prime.	10	4	6
118	 He's a tried and tested battle commander.	10	4	6
119	 And he doesn't just talk about paying people back,	10	4	6
120	 he does it.	10	4	6

122	 The captain shouts to his first mate,	11	4	6

125	 And when the pirates try to board,	11	4	6
126	 the brave captain leads his men to victory.	11	4	6
127	 A few days later, the lookout screams,	11	4	6
128	" ""Two pirate ships!"""	11	4	6
129	 The crew is shivering like scared mice.	11	4	6
130	 But the courageous captain hollers,	11	4	6
131	" ""Bring me my red shirt!"""	11	4	6
132	 After the battle, the first mate asks,	11	4	6
133	" ""Captain, why do you call for your red shirt before battle?"""	11	4	6
134	 The captain replies,	11	4	6
135	" ""So that if I am stabbed, you will not see me bleed."""	11	4	6
136	 The next morning the lookout screams,	11	4	6
137	" ""10 pirate ships!"	11	4	6
138	" ""We are surrounded!"""	11	4	6
139	 The crew goes silent.	12	4	6
140	 They all look to their brave captain,	12	4	6
141	 waiting for his usual command.	12	4	6
142	 Calm as ever, the captain bellows...	12	4	6
143	" ""Bring me my brown pants!"""	12	4	6

239	 Take them off.	21	4	6
240	 Do you love me, Reek?	22	4	6
241	 Yes, of course, my lord.	23	4	6
242	 Good.	23	4	6
243	 Because I need you to do something for me.	23	4	6
244	 Something very important.	23	4	6
245	 There's a castle, you see.	23	4	6
246	 Some bad men hold this castle.	23	4	6
247	 I need your help to take this castle back.	23	4	6
248	 But how can...	23	4	6
249	 I need you to play a role.	23	4	6
250	 To pretend to be someone you're not.	23	4	6
251	 Pretend to be who?	23	4	6
252	 Theon Greyjoy.	23	4	6

262	 He is a goatherd.	26	4	6
263	 He says he prayed for your victory against the slave masters.	26	4	6
264	 I thank him for his prayers.	26	4	6
265	 It was your dragons, he says.	26	4	6
266	 They came this morning for his flock.	26	4	6
267	 He hopes he has not offended Your Grace,	26	4	6
268	 but now he has nothing.	26	4	6
269	 Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship.	26	4	6
270	  I cannot bring back his goats,	26	4	6
271	 but I will see he is paid their value three times over.	26	4	6
272	 Send the next one in.	27	4	6
273	 _	27	4	6
274	 _	27	4	6
275	 Queen Daenerys.	27	4	6
276	 Tales of your beauty were not exaggerated.	28	4	6
277	 I thank you.	28	4	6
278	 Mine is one of the oldest and proudest families in Meereen.	28	4	6
279	 Then it is my honor to receive you.	28	4	6
280	 My father, one of Meereen's most respected	28	4	6
281	 and beloved citizens, oversaw the restoration	28	4	6
282	 and maintenance of its greatest landmarks.	28	4	6
283	 This pyramid included.	28	4	6
284	 For that, he has my gratitude.	28	4	6
285	 I should be honored to meet him.	28	4	6
286	 You have, Your Grace.	28	4	6
287	 You crucified him.	28	4	6
288	 I pray you'll never live to see	28	4	6
289	 a member of your family treated so cruelly.	28	4	6
290	 Your father crucified innocent children.	28	4	6
291	 My father spoke out against crucifying those children.	28	4	6
292	 He decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled.	28	4	6
293	 Is it justice to answer one crime with another?	28	4	6
294	 I am sorry you no longer have a father,	28	4	6
295	 but my treatment of the masters was no crime.	28	4	6
296	 You'd be wise to remember that.	29	4	6
297	 What's done is done.	29	4	6
298	 You are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen.	29	4	6
299	 A servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated.	29	4	6
300	 And what traditions do you speak of?	29	4	6
301	 The tradition of funeral rite.	29	4	6
302	 Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces.	29	4	6
303	 My father and 162 noble Meereenese	29	4	6
304	 are still nailed to those posts,	29	4	6
305	 carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun.	29	4	6
306	 Your Grace, I ask that you order these men taken down	29	4	6
307	 so that they might receive proper burials.	29	4	6
308	 And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified?	29	4	6
309	 They were rotting in the sun as well.	30	4	6
310	 Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial?	30	4	6
311	 Your Grace, I cannot defend the actions of the masters.	30	4	6
312	 I can only speak to you as a son who loved his father.	30	4	6
313	 Let me take his body down.	30	4	6
314	 Let me have him brought to the temple	30	4	6
315	 and buried with dignity	30	4	6
316	 so that he might find peace in the next world.	30	4	6
317	 Bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq.	30	4	6
318	 Thank you, my queen.	30	4	6
319	 How many more?	30	4	6
320	 There are 212 supplicants waiting, Your Grace.	30	4	6
321	 212?	31	4	6
322	 Send the next one in.	31	4	6
323	 These meetings aren't always going to be this early, are they?	31	4	6
324	 I was up late last night.	31	4	6
325	 So, does this mean I am a master of something now?	31	4	6
326	 Coins, ships?	31	4	6
327	 Lord Tywin and I already determined	31	4	6
328	 that I shall be the Master of Ships long before you...	31	4	6
329	 Lord Tywin, it's a great honor	31	4	6
330	 to have been granted a seat on this council. I...	31	4	6
331	 The trial begins this afternoon.	31	4	6
332	 We only have the morning for affairs of state.	31	4	6
333	 Shall we begin?	31	4	6
334	 Sandor Clegane has been spotted	31	4	6
335	 in the Riverlands, my lord.	31	4	6
336	 A coward and a traitor.	32	4	6
337	 My birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers.	32	4	6
338	" I believe the phrase ""fuck the king"" was uttered."	32	4	6
339	 Disgraceful.	32	4	6
340	 What would it take to make the common soldier	32	4	6
341	 stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?	32	4	6
342	 10 silver stags seems a generous bounty.	32	4	6
343	 Make it 100. What else?	32	4	6
344	 More whispers from the east, my lord.	32	4	6
345	 The Targaryen girl?	32	4	6
346	 Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen.	32	4	6
347	 She has conquered the city and rules as its queen.	32	4	6
348	 Conquered with what?	32	4	6
349	 She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen.	32	4	6
350	 Some 8,000 strong.	32	4	6
351	 She has a company of sellswords...	32	4	6
352	 the Second Sons.	32	4	6
353	 She has two knights advising her...	32	4	6
354	 Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy.	32	4	6
355	 And she has three dragons.	32	4	6
356	 Baby dragons.	32	4	6
357	 Larger every year, Your Grace.	33	4	6
358	 Mormont is spying on her for us.	33	4	6
359	 No longer. He appears to be fully devoted to her.	33	4	6
360	 As for Ser Barristan, it would seem	33	4	6
361	 he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard	33	4	6
362	 a bit harder than anticipated.	33	4	6
363	 He's an old man.	33	4	6
364	 He wasn't fit to protect my son.	33	4	6
365	 Joffrey didn't die on his watch.	33	4	6
366	 Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.	33	4	6
367	 Don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world.	33	4	6
368	 A child with two seasoned warriors counseling her	33	4	6
369	 and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace.	33	4	6
370	 Lord Varys is right.	33	4	6
371	 I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand.	33	4	6
372	 They are very impressive on the battlefield.	33	4	6
373	 Less so in the bedroom.	33	4	6
374	 Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years.	33	4	6
375	 Armies win them all the time.	33	4	6
376	 She must be dealt with.	34	4	6
377	 How, my lord?	34	4	6
378	 By force?	34	4	6
379	 Eventually, if it comes to that.	34	4	6
380	 Can your little birds find their way into Meereen?	34	4	6
381	 Most certainly, my Lord Hand.	34	4	6
382	 Mmm. Lord Tyrell, be a good man.	34	4	6
383	 Fetch my quill and paper.	34	4	6
384	 Prince Oberyn.	34	4	6
385	 Lord Varys...	34	4	6
386	 Only Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman.	34	4	6
387	 No one is under obligation to call me lord.	34	4	6
388	 And yet everyone does.	35	4	6
389	 You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied.	35	4	6
390	 Did you spend much time in Essos?	35	4	6
391	 Five years.	35	4	6
392	 May I ask why?	35	4	6
393	 'Tis a big and beautiful world.	35	4	6
394	 Most of us live and die	35	4	6
395	 in the same corner where we were born	35	4	6
396	 and never get to see any of it.	35	4	6
397	 I don't want to be most of us.	35	4	6
398	 Most of us aren't princes.	35	4	6
399	 You are from Essos.	35	4	6
400	 Where? Lys?	35	4	6
401	 I have an ear for accents.	35	4	6
402	 I've lost my accent entirely.	35	4	6
403	 I have an ear for that as well.	35	4	6
404	 How did you get here?	35	4	6
405	 It's a long story.	35	4	6
406	 One you don't like telling people.	35	4	6
407	 People I trust.	36	4	6
408	 My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting.	36	4	6
409	 You should come to the brothel and meet her.	36	4	6
410	 We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here.	36	4	6
411	 We have some lovely boys on retainer, but...	36	4	6
412	 You did like boys before?	36	4	6
413	 Really?	36	4	6
414	 Girls? Hmm.	36	4	6
415	 I hope you won't be offended when I say I never would have guessed.	36	4	6
416	 Not at all.	36	4	6
417	 But I was never interested in girls, either.	36	4	6
418	 - What then? -  Nothing.	36	4	6
419	 Everybody is interested in something.	36	4	6
420	 Not me.	36	4	6
421	 When I see what desire does to people,	36	4	6
422	 what it's done to this country,	36	4	6
423	 I am very glad to have no part in it.	36	4	6
424	 Besides, the absence of desire	36	4	6
425	 leaves one free to pursue other things.	37	4	6
426	 Such as?	37	4	6
427	 Let me guess, I've been pardoned.	37	4	6
428	 Really?	38	4	6
429	 Father's orders.	38	4	6
430	 Well, we mustn't disappoint Father.	38	4	6
431	 Kingslayer!	38	4	6
432	 I, Tommen of the House Baratheon,	39	4	6
433	 First of my Name,	39	4	6
434	 King of the Andals and the First Men,	39	4	6
435	 and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,	39	4	6
436	 do hereby recuse myself from this trial.	39	4	6
437	 Tywin of the House Lannister, Hand of the King,	39	4	6
438	 Protector of the Realm, will sit as judge in my stead.	39	4	6
439	 And with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell	39	4	6
440	 and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell.	39	4	6
441	 And if found guilty...	40	4	6
442	 may the gods punish the accused.	40	4	6
443	 Tyrion of the House Lannister,	40	4	6
444	 you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide.	40	4	6
445	 Did you kill King Joffrey?	41	4	6
446	 No.	41	4	6
447	 Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?	41	4	6
448	 Not that I know of.	41	4	6
449	 How would you say he died, then?	41	4	6
450	 Choked on his pigeon pie.	41	4	6
451	 So you would blame the bakers?	41	4	6
452	 Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.	41	4	6
453	 The crown may call its first witness.	41	4	6
454	 Once we'd got King Joffrey safely away	41	4	6
455	 from the mob, the Imp rounded on him.	41	4	6
456	 He slapped the king across the face	41	4	6
457	 and called him a vicious idiot and a fool.	41	4	6
458	 It wasn't the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey.	41	4	6
459	 Right here in this throne room,	41	4	6
460	 he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit.	41	4	6
461	 Compared His Grace to the Mad King	41	4	6
462	 and suggested he'd meet the same fate.	41	4	6
463	 And when I spoke in the king's defense,	41	4	6
464	 he threatened to have me killed.	42	4	6
465	 Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?	42	4	6
466	 - Silence. - Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark	42	4	6
467	 while you tore at her clothes and beat her.	42	4	6
468	 Silence!	42	4	6
469	 You will not speak unless called upon.	42	4	6
470	 You're dismissed, Ser Meryn.	42	4	6
471	 Basilisk venom,	42	4	6
472	 widow's blood,	42	4	6
473	 wolfsbane,	42	4	6
474	 essence of nightshade,	42	4	6
475	 sweetsleep,	42	4	6
476	 tears of Lys,	42	4	6
477	 demon's dance...	42	4	6
478	 blind eye...	42	4	6
479	 I think you have made your point, Grand Maester.	42	4	6
480	 You have a lot of poison in your store.	42	4	6
481	 Had, Prince Oberyn.	43	4	6
482	 My stores were plundered.	43	4	6
483	 By whom?	43	4	6
484	 By the accused, Tyrion Lannister,	43	4	6
485	 after he had me wrongfully imprisoned.	43	4	6
486	 Grand Maester,	43	4	6
487	 you examined King Joffrey's corpse.	43	4	6
488	 Was it without question poison that killed him?	43	4	6
489	 Without question.	43	4	6
490	 This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard,	43	4	6
491	 the king's fool.	43	4	6
492	 He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark,	43	4	6
493	 the wife of the accused, away from the feast.	43	4	6
494	 She wore this necklace	43	4	6
495	 the day of the wedding.	43	4	6
496	 Residue of a most rare	43	4	6
497	 and terrible poison was found inside.	43	4	6
498	 Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?	44	4	6
499	 It was. The Strangler.	44	4	6
500	 A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess.	44	4	6
501	 And used to strike down the most noble child	44	4	6
502	 the gods ever put on this good earth.	44	4	6
503	" ""I will hurt you for this."	44	4	6
504	 A day will come when you think you are safe and happy	44	4	6
505	 and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth	44	4	6
506	" ""and you will know the debt is paid."""	44	4	6
507	 Your own brother said this to you?	44	4	6
508	 Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay.	44	4	6
509	 I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines.	44	4	6
510	 As it turned out, when the attack came,	45	4	6
511	 Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements.	45	4	6
512	 He believed his presence would inspire the troops.	45	4	6
513	 Tyrion said,	45	4	6
514	" ""And you will know the debt is paid."""	45	4	6
515	 What debt?	45	4	6
516	 I discovered he'd been keeping whores	45	4	6
517	 in the Tower of the Hand.	45	4	6
518	 I asked him to confine his salacious acts	45	4	6
519	 to the brothel where such behavior belongs.	45	4	6
520	 He wasn't pleased.	45	4	6
521	 Thank you, Your Grace,	45	4	6
522	 for the courage of your testimony.	45	4	6
523	  Do you remember the precise nature of this threat?	46	4	6
524	 I'm afraid I do, my lord.	46	4	6
525	" ""He said, "" Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then."	46	4	6
526	 Monsters are dangerous	46	4	6
527	" ""and just now kings are dying like flies."""	46	4	6
528	 And he said this to you at a meeting of the small council?	46	4	6
529	 Yes.	46	4	6
530	 After we received word of Robb Stark's death.	46	4	6
531	 He didn't seem gladdened by the news.	46	4	6
532	 Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark	46	4	6
533	 had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.	46	4	6
534	 You're excused, Lord Varys.	46	4	6
535	 Father, may I ask the witness one question?	46	4	6
536	 One.	46	4	6
537	 You once said	47	4	6
538	 that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat.	47	4	6
539	 You said the histories would never mention me,	47	4	6
540	 but you would not forget.	47	4	6
541	 Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?	47	4	6
542	 Sadly, my lord,	47	4	6
543	 I never forget a thing.	47	4	6
544	 We will adjourn for now.	47	4	6
545	 Toll the bells in an hour's time.	47	4	6
546	 Clear the court!	47	4	6
547	 You'd condemn your own son to death?	48	4	6
548	 I've condemned no one. The trial is not over.	48	4	6
549	 This isn't a trial. It's a farce.	48	4	6
550	 Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.	48	4	6
551	 I know nothing of the sort.	48	4	6
552	 - You've always hated Tyrion. - He killed his king.	48	4	6
553	 As did I.	48	4	6
554	 Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me?	48	4	6
555	 To bring him your head.	48	4	6
556	 I saved your life so you could murder my brother?	48	4	6
557	 - It won't be murder. It'll be justice. - Justice?	48	4	6
558	 I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King.	48	4	6
559	 If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly.	48	4	6
560	 - He'll be executed. - No, he'll be punished accordingly.	48	4	6
561	 Once you said family is what lives on.	48	4	6
562	 All that lives on.	49	4	6
563	 You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years.	49	4	6
564	 What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies?	49	4	6
565	 I'm a Kingsguard,	49	4	6
566	 forbidden by oath to carry on the family line.	49	4	6
567	 I'm well aware of your oath.	49	4	6
568	 What happens to your name?	49	4	6
569	 Who carries the lion banner into future battles?	49	4	6
570	 Your nephews?	49	4	6
571	 Lancel Lannister?	49	4	6
572	 Others whose names I don't even remember?	49	4	6
573	 What happens to my dynasty	49	4	6
574	 if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?	49	4	6
575	 It survives through me.	49	4	6
576	 I'll leave the Kingsguard.	49	4	6
577	 I'll take my place as your son and heir	49	4	6
578	 if you let Tyrion live.	49	4	6
579	 Done.	49	4	6
580	 When the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered,	49	4	6
581	 Tyrion will be given the chance to speak.	50	4	6
582	 He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch.	50	4	6
583	 In three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black	50	4	6
584	 and live out his days at the Wall.	50	4	6
585	 You'll remove your white cloak immediately.	50	4	6
586	 You will leave King's Landing	50	4	6
587	 to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock.	50	4	6
588	 You will marry a suitable woman	50	4	6
589	 and father children named Lannister.	50	4	6
590	 And you'll never turn your back on your family again.	50	4	6
591	 You have my word.	50	4	6
592	 And you have mine.	50	4	6
593	 Not going well, is it?	51	4	6
594	 - You're going to be found guilty. - Oh, you think so?	51	4	6
595	 When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy	51	4	6
596	 and ask to be sent to the Wall.	51	4	6
597	 Father's agreed to it.	51	4	6
598	 He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch.	51	4	6
599	 Ned Stark was promised the same thing	51	4	6
600	 and we both know how that turned out.	51	4	6
601	 Father is not Joffrey. He'll keep his word.	51	4	6
602	 How do you know?	51	4	6
603	 Do you trust me?	51	4	6
604	 Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts.	51	4	6
605	 This will all be over soon.	51	4	6
606	 The crown may call its next witness.	52	4	6
607	 State your name.	52	4	6
608	 Shae.	53	4	6
609	 Do you swear by all the gods	53	4	6
610	 that your testimony will be true and honest?	53	4	6
611	 I swear it.	53	4	6
612	 Do you know this man?	53	4	6
613	 Yes. Tyrion Lannister.	53	4	6
614	 How do you know him?	53	4	6
615	 I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.	53	4	6
616	 This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey.	53	4	6
617	 What do you know of this?	53	4	6
618	 I know that he's guilty.	53	4	6
619	 He and Sansa planned it together.	53	4	6
620	 Silence!	53	4	6
621	 Continue.	53	4	6
622	 She wanted revenge for her father,	53	4	6
623	 her mother, her brother.	53	4	6
624	 She blamed their deaths on the king.	54	4	6
625	 Tyrion was happy to help.	54	4	6
626	 He hated Joffrey. He hated the queen.	54	4	6
627	 He hated you, my lord.	54	4	6
628	 He stole poison from the Grand Maester's chamber	54	4	6
629	 to put in Joffrey's wine.	54	4	6
630	 How could you possibly know all this?	54	4	6
631	 Why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid?	54	4	6
632	 I wasn't just her maid.	54	4	6
633	 I was his whore.	54	4	6
634	  I beg your pardon?	54	4	6
635	 You said you were his...	54	4	6
636	 His whore.	54	4	6
637	 How did you come to be in his service?	54	4	6
638	 He stole me.	54	4	6
639	 I was with another man,	54	4	6
640	 a knight in your lordship's army.	54	4	6
641	 But when Tyrion arrived at the camp,	54	4	6
642	 he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent.	55	4	6
643	 He broke the knight's arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion.	55	4	6
644	" ""You belong to me now,"" he said."	55	4	6
645	" ""I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world."""	55	4	6
646	 Silence. Silence!	55	4	6
647	 And did you?	55	4	6
648	 Did I what?	55	4	6
649	 Fuck him like it was his last night in this world.	55	4	6
650	 I did everything he wanted.	55	4	6
651	 Whatever he told me to do to him.	55	4	6
652	 Whatever he felt like doing to me.	55	4	6
653	 I kissed him where he wanted.	55	4	6
654	 I licked him where he wanted.	55	4	6
655	 I let him put himself where he wanted.	55	4	6
656	 I was his property.	55	4	6
657	 I would wait in his chambers for hours	55	4	6
658	 so he could use me when he was bored.	55	4	6
659	" He ordered me to call him ""my lion,"" so I did."	55	4	6
660	 I took his face in my hands and said,	56	4	6
661	" ""I am yours and you are mine."""	56	4	6
662	 Shae.	56	4	6
663	 Please don't.	56	4	6
664	 I am a whore.	56	4	6
665	 Remember?	56	4	6
666	 That was before he married Sansa.	56	4	6
667	 After that, all he wanted was her.	56	4	6
668	 But she wouldn't let him into her bed.	56	4	6
669	 So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her.	56	4	6
670	 I wish to confess.	57	4	6
671	 I wish... to confess.	57	4	6
672	 You wish to confess?	57	4	6
673	 I saved you.	57	4	6
674	 I saved this city	57	4	6
675	 and all your worthless lives.	57	4	6
676	 I should have let Stannis kill you all.	57	4	6
677	 Tyrion.	57	4	6
678	 Do you wish to confess?	57	4	6
679	 Yes, Father.	57	4	6
680	 I'm guilty.	57	4	6
681	 Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?	57	4	6
682	 You admit you poisoned the king?	57	4	6
683	 No, of that I'm innocent.	57	4	6
684	 I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime.	58	4	6
685	 I am guilty of being a dwarf.	58	4	6
686	 You are not on trial for being a dwarf.	58	4	6
687	 Oh, yes, I am.	58	4	6
688	 I've been on trial for that my entire life.	58	4	6
689	 Have you nothing to say in your defense?	58	4	6
690	 Nothing but this...	58	4	6
691	 I did not do it.	58	4	6
692	 I did not kill Joffrey,	58	4	6
693	 but I wish that I had.	58	4	6
694	 Watching your vicious bastard die	58	4	6
695	 gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores.	58	4	6
696	 I wish I was the monster you think I am.	58	4	6
697	 I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you.	58	4	6
698	 I would gladly give my life	58	4	6
699	 to watch you all swallow it.	59	4	6
700	 Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn.	59	4	6
701	 Escort the prisoner back to his cell.	59	4	6
702	 I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder.	59	4	6
703	 And I know I'll get no justice here.	59	4	6
704	 So I will let the gods decide my fate.	59	4	6
705	 I demand a trial by combat.	59	4	6

57	 He will.	6	3	5
58	 But not today.	7	3	5
59	 Orell says there are crows patrolling on the Wall.	7	3	5
60	 Tell me what you know.	7	3	5
61	 There are four to a patrol--	7	3	5
62	 two builders to check for structural damage,	7	3	5
63	 two rangers to watch for enemies.	7	3	5
64	 How often do these patrols go out?	7	3	5
65	 It varies.	7	3	5
66	 If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you.	7	3	5
67	 You'd like to know that.	7	3	5
68	 There are 19 castles guarding the Wall.	7	3	5
69	 How many are manned?	7	3	5
70	 Three.	7	3	5
71	 You sure of that?	7	3	5
72	 Which three?	8	3	5
73	 Castle Black.	8	3	5
74	 Aye, Castle Black.	8	3	5
75	 Everyone knows Castle Black.	8	3	5
76	 Which others?	8	3	5
77	 Eastwatch-by-the-Sea	8	3	5
78	 and the Shadow Tower.	8	3	5
79	 How many men remain in Castle Black?	8	3	5
80	 - 1,000. - Liar.	8	3	5
81	 What happens to your eagle after I kill you?	8	3	5
82	 Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut	8	3	5
83	 or does he just flop dead to the ground?	8	3	5
84	 He's no crow.	8	3	5
85	 Just 'cause you want him inside you don't make him one of us.	8	3	5
86	 I'm not afraid of you.	8	3	5
87	 I like you, boy.	8	3	5
88	 But if you lie to me,	8	3	5
89	 I'll pull your guts out through your throat.	9	3	5
90	 1,000 men.	9	3	5
91	 We'll find out soon enough.	9	3	5
92	 I don't need you to protect me.	9	3	5
93	 Of course you do.	9	3	5
94	 Who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat?	9	3	5
95	 Who vouched for you with Mance?	9	3	5
96	 It seems you owe me a debt.	9	3	5
97	 - Give it back. - Well, I stole it.	9	3	5
98	 It's mine. If you want it, come steal it back.	9	3	5
99	 Ygritte!	9	3	5
100	 Ygritte!	9	3	5
101	 Ygritte! Seven hells.	9	3	5
102	 Ygritte!	9	3	5
103	 Is Orell right?	10	3	5
104	 Are you still a crow?	10	3	5
105	 It's time you proved yourself.	10	3	5
106	 Ygritte.	10	3	5
107	 You swore some vows.	10	3	5
108	 I want you to break 'em.	10	3	5
109	 I want you to see me.	10	3	5
110	 All of me.	10	3	5
111	 We shouldn't.	10	3	5
112	 We should.	10	3	5
113	 Why are you still dressed?	11	3	5
114	 You know nothing, Jon Sno--	11	3	5
115	 That thing you did	11	3	5
116	 with your mouth--	11	3	5
117	 is that what lords do to their ladies in the South?	11	3	5
118	 I don't know.	11	3	5
119	 I just wanted to kiss you there is all.	11	3	5
120	 Hmm.	11	3	5
121	 You seemed to like it.	11	3	5
122	 Aye, I liked it some.	11	3	5
123	 Who taught you that?	11	3	5
124	 There's been no one else. Only you.	11	3	5
125	 A maid.	11	3	5
126	 You were a maid.	11	3	5
127	 I was a man of the Night's Watch.	11	3	5
128	 How about you? Were you a maid?	11	3	5
129	 What do you think?	12	3	5
130	 - Who was he? - Just a boy.	12	3	5
131	 He came trading with his brothers.	12	3	5
132	 He had red hair like me. Kissed by fire.	12	3	5
133	 But...	12	3	5
134	 he was weak.	12	3	5
135	 Not like you.	12	3	5
136	 That was the first one.	12	3	5
137	 Then there was this Thenn boy.	12	3	5
138	 Spoke no Common, but gods, he was built like a mammoth.	12	3	5
139	 Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough.	12	3	5
140	 We'd best get back.	12	3	5
141	 Tormund--	12	3	5
142	 I'm not done with you yet.	12	3	5
143	 How long's it been since you had a bath?	12	3	5
144	 Let's not go back.	13	3	5
145	 Let's stay here a while longer.	13	3	5
146	 I don't ever want to leave this cave, Jon Snow.	13	3	5
147	 Not ever.	13	3	5
148	 I want my gold.	13	3	5
149	 It says it clearly right there on that note	13	3	5
150	 you'll be repaid in full when the war is over.	13	3	5
151	 Piss on that! You're nothing but thieves.	13	3	5
152	 We're outlaws. Outlaws steal.	13	3	5
153	 You're lucky we didn't kill you.	13	3	5
154	 Come try it, archer.	13	3	5
155	 I'll shove those arrows up your ass.	13	3	5
156	 You can't let him go. He's a murderer. He's guilty.	13	3	5
157	 - Not in the eyes of god. - You can't!	13	3	5
158	 Enough! The judgment isn't ours to make.	13	3	5
159	 Go in peace, Sandor Clegane.	13	3	5
160	 The Lord of Light isn't done with you yet.	14	3	5
161	 Riders coming through!	14	3	5
162	 The Kingslayer.	14	3	5
163	 Down!	14	3	5
164	 On your knees.	14	3	5
165	 Lord Bolton, I give you the Kingslayer.	14	3	5
166	 Pick him up, Locke.	14	3	5
167	 You've lost a hand.	14	3	5
168	 No, my lord, he has it here.	14	3	5
169	 - Take this away. - Send it to his father?	14	3	5
170	 You'll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it.	14	3	5
171	 Cut her free. Apologies, my lady.	14	3	5
172	 You're under my protection now.	14	3	5
173	 Thank you, my lord.	14	3	5
174	 Find suitable rooms for our guests.	15	3	5
175	 We'll speak later.	15	3	5
176	 Lord Bolton.	15	3	5
177	 Is there word from the capital?	15	3	5
178	 You haven't heard?	15	3	5
179	 Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing.	15	3	5
180	 Sailed into Blackwater Bay.	15	3	5
181	 Stormed the gates with thousands of men.	15	3	5
182	 And your sister...	15	3	5
183	 How can I put this?	15	3	5
184	 Your sister...	15	3	5
185	 is alive and well.	15	3	5
186	 Your father's forces prevailed.	15	3	5
187	 Ser Jaime isn't well.	15	3	5
188	 Take him to Qyburn.	15	3	5
189	 - Will I die? - No.	16	3	5
190	 The corruption has spread.	16	3	5
191	 I fear it must be cut away.	16	3	5
192	 The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.	16	3	5
193	 Then you'll die.	16	3	5
194	 You're no maester.	16	3	5
195	 Where's your chain?	16	3	5
196	 The Citadel stripped me of it.	16	3	5
197	 They found some of my experiments	16	3	5
198	 too bold.	16	3	5
199	 I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow.	16	3	5
200	 I don't need my right hand to kill you.	16	3	5
201	 I can take away the rotting flesh	16	3	5
202	 and try and burn out the corruption	16	3	5
203	 - with boiling wine. - Mmm.	16	3	5
204	 With any luck, that will suffice.	17	3	5
205	 You'll need milk of the poppy.	17	3	5
206	 - No milk of the poppy. - There will be pain.	17	3	5
207	 - I'll scream. - Quite a bit of pain.	17	3	5
208	 I'll scream loudly.	17	3	5
209	 Lord Baelish.	17	3	5
210	 Your Grace.	17	3	5
211	 I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.	17	3	5
212	 Of course, Your Grace.	17	3	5
213	 I have reason to believe that House Tyrell	17	3	5
214	 do not hold the crown's best interests at heart.	17	3	5
215	 I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?	18	3	5
216	 My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.	18	3	5
217	 Myself, I often find them a hindrance.	18	3	5
218	 And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know.	18	3	5
219	 He's almost as generous to those who help us	18	3	5
220	 as he is unpleasant towards those who don't.	18	3	5
221	 You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells.	18	3	5
222	 I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital.	18	3	5
223	 - I shall do my best. - Thank you.	18	3	5
224	 And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?	18	3	5
225	 I assure you that it will.	18	3	5
226	 Gods, boy, that's enough. We're not in a tavern.	18	3	5
227	 - Pardon, my lady. - No need to speak.	18	3	5
228	 Are there any figs? Fetch some.	18	3	5
229	 I always take figs midafternoon.	18	3	5
230	 They help move the bowels.	18	3	5
231	 To what do I owe this summons?	18	3	5
232	 Thank you for seeing me, my lady.	18	3	5
233	 I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters.	18	3	5
234	 I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?	18	3	5
235	 It's the royal wedding.	19	3	5
236	 I'm told you had a hand in planning it.	19	3	5
237	 Naturally.	19	3	5
238	 It's shaping up to be a very involved affair.	19	3	5
239	 The word extravagant has been used.	19	3	5
240	 What good is the word extravagant	19	3	5
241	 if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?	19	3	5
242	 - I understand that. - Good.	19	3	5
243	 But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me	19	3	5
244	 to calculate the cost for the crown.	19	3	5
245	 As of now, it's a huge expense.	19	3	5
246	 And?	19	3	5
247	 And we're at war, Lady Olenna.	19	3	5
248	 Oh, I'd nearly forgotten.	19	3	5
249	 Yes, and maintaining supply lines--	19	3	5
250	 I can't think how it slipped my mind.	19	3	5
251	 What is it, 12,000 infantrymen	19	3	5
252	 the Tyrell family has supplied?	19	3	5
253	 1,800 mounted lances.	19	3	5
254	 2,000 in support.	19	3	5
255	 Provisions so this city might survive the winter.	19	3	5
256	 A million bushels of wheat.	19	3	5
257	 Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye.	19	3	5
258	 20,000 head of cattle.	19	3	5
259	 50,000 sheep.	19	3	5
260	 You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses.	19	3	5
261	 I'm quite familiar with them.	19	3	5
262	 And we are so grateful for your contributions	19	3	5
263	 which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.	19	3	5
264	 As is a royal wedding.	20	3	5
265	 The people are hungry for more than just food.	20	3	5
266	 They crave distractions.	20	3	5
267	 And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own.	20	3	5
268	 And their distractions are likely to end	20	3	5
269	 with us being torn to pieces.	20	3	5
270	 A royal wedding is much safer.	20	3	5
271	 - Wouldn't you say? - I would.	20	3	5
272	 And traditionally paid for	20	3	5
273	 by the royal family.	20	3	5
274	 I was told you were drunk, impertinent,	20	3	5
275	 and thoroughly debauched.	20	3	5
276	 You can imagine my disappointment	20	3	5
277	 at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper.	20	3	5
278	 Where did you go for them, Volantis?	20	3	5
279	 - My lady-- - Oh, very well.	20	3	5
280	 I won't have it said that House Tyrell	20	3	5
281	 refuses to play its part.	20	3	5
282	 We'll pay for half the expenses	20	3	5
283	 and the celebrations will go on as planned.	20	3	5
284	 - Is that sufficient? - Quite sufficient. Thank you.	20	3	5
285	 Very good, then. That's settled. Good day.	20	3	5
286	 Give me that.	21	3	5
287	 What are you doing?	21	3	5
288	 Just mending Lord Beric's armor.	21	3	5
289	 Why?	21	3	5
290	 I'm going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood.	21	3	5
291	 Have you lost your mind?	21	3	5
292	 When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths?	21	3	5
293	 They'll cave your head in with your own helmet.	21	3	5
294	 The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood.	21	3	5
295	 You don't have to do this.	21	3	5
296	 I want to.	21	3	5
297	 They need good men.	21	3	5
298	 Robb needs good men, too. We're leaving tomorrow.	21	3	5
299	 - And then you-- - What? Serve him?	21	3	5
300	 I've served men my entire life.	21	3	5
301	 I served Master Mott at King's Landing	21	3	5
302	 and he sold me to the Watch.	21	3	5
303	 I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal,	21	3	5
304	 wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed.	21	3	5
305	 I'm done serving.	21	3	5
306	 You just said you were serving Lord Beric.	21	3	5
307	 He may be their leader, but they chose him.	21	3	5
308	 These men are brothers. They're a family.	22	3	5
309	 I've never had a family.	22	3	5
310	 I can be your family.	22	3	5
311	 You wouldn't be my family.	22	3	5
312	" You'd be ""my lady."""	22	3	5
313	 Willem.	22	3	5
314	 Willem!	22	3	5
315	 - Is this a rescue? - Lannister filth! Take him!	22	3	5
316	 Please, I didn't do anything. I'm just a squire.	22	3	5
317	 Please--	22	3	5
318	 Bring them in.	23	3	5
319	 Is that all of them?	23	3	5
320	 It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?	23	3	5
321	 Not murder, Your Grace.	23	3	5
322	 Vengeance.	23	3	5
323	 Vengeance?	23	3	5
324	 Those boys didn't kill your sons.	23	3	5
325	 I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen--	23	3	5
326	 Was strangled by the Kingslayer.	23	3	5
327	 - They were his kin. - They were boys!	23	3	5
328	 Look at them.	23	3	5
329	 Tell your mother to look at them.	23	3	5
330	 She killed them as much as I.	23	3	5
331	 My mother had nothing to do with this.	24	3	5
332	 This was your treason.	24	3	5
333	 It's treason to free your enemies.	24	3	5
334	 In war, you kill your enemies.	24	3	5
335	 Did your father not teach you that, boy?	24	3	5
336	 Leave him.	24	3	5
337	 Aye.	24	3	5
338	 Leave me to the king.	24	3	5
339	 He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free.	24	3	5
340	 That's how he deals with treason.	24	3	5
341	 Our King in the North.	24	3	5
342	 Or should I call him	24	3	5
343	 the King Who Lost the North?	24	3	5
344	 Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon.	24	3	5
345	 Hang the rest.	24	3	5
346	 Mercy, sire! I didn't kill anyone.	24	3	5
347	 I only watched for the guards.	24	3	5
348	 This one was only the watcher.	24	3	5
349	 Hang him last so he can watch the others die.	24	3	5
350	 Please! Please, no. They made me do it!	24	3	5
351	 They made me! They made me!	24	3	5
352	 Word of this can't leave Riverrun.	25	3	5
353	 They were Tywin Lannister's nephews.	25	3	5
354	 The Lannisters pay their debts.	25	3	5
355	 They never stop talking about it.	25	3	5
356	 Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer?	25	3	5
357	 It wouldn't be lying.	25	3	5
358	 We will bury them and remain silent	25	3	5
359	 until the war is done.	25	3	5
360	 I'm not fighting for justice	25	3	5
361	 if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks,	25	3	5
362	 no matter how highborn.	25	3	5
363	 He has to die.	25	3	5
364	 The Karstarks are Northmen.	25	3	5
365	 They won't forgive the killing of their lord.	25	3	5
366	 Your mother's right.	25	3	5
367	 If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you.	25	3	5
368	 You tended to their wounds.	25	3	5
369	 You brought them supper. Now they're dead.	25	3	5
370	 And more boys will keep dying until this war is over.	25	3	5
371	 You need Karstark men to end it.	25	3	5
372	 Spare his life. Keep him as a hostage.	25	3	5
373	 A hostage.	25	3	5
374	 Tell the Karstarks that as long as they remain loyal,	26	3	5
375	 he will not be harmed.	26	3	5
376	 The blood of the First Men flows through my veins	26	3	5
377	 as much as yours, boy.	26	3	5
378	 I fought the Mad King for your father.	26	3	5
379	 I fought Joffrey for you.	26	3	5
380	 We are kin--	26	3	5
381	 Stark and Karstark.	26	3	5
382	 That didn't stop you from betraying me.	26	3	5
383	 And it won't save you now.	26	3	5
384	 I don't want it to save me.	26	3	5
385	 I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.	26	3	5
386	 Kneel, my lord.	26	3	5
387	 Rickard Karstark,	27	3	5
388	 Lord of Karhold,	27	3	5
389	 here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die.	27	3	5
390	 Would you speak a final word?	27	3	5
391	 Kill me and be cursed.	27	3	5
392	 You are no king of mine.	27	3	5
393	 Joffrey.	27	3	5
394	 Cersei.	27	3	5
395	 Ilyn Payne.	27	3	5
396	 Ser Meryn.	27	3	5
397	 The Hound.	27	3	5
398	 What are you going to do with me?	28	3	5
399	 At first light we'll ride for Riverrun.	28	3	5
400	 Your brother's there now.	28	3	5
401	 He'll make a contribution to our cause	28	3	5
402	 and you can go home.	28	3	5
403	 I'm a hostage and you're selling me.	28	3	5
404	 Don't think of it that way.	28	3	5
405	 - But it is that way. - It is.	28	3	5
406	 - And it isn't. - More is than isn't.	28	3	5
407	 Beric admired your father a great deal, you know.	28	3	5
408	 He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether.	28	3	5
409	 - So why don't you? - We need the gold.	28	3	5
410	 Do I frighten you, child?	28	3	5
411	 No.	28	3	5
412	 You're angry with me.	28	3	5
413	 And I don't blame you.	28	3	5
414	 But letting him go was the right thing.	28	3	5
415	 I have more reason than most to want him hanged.	29	3	5
416	 - I thought he killed you. - He did.	29	3	5
417	 But how...?	29	3	5
418	 Thoros...	29	3	5
419	 how many times have you brought me back?	29	3	5
420	 It's the Lord of Light brings you back.	29	3	5
421	 I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.	29	3	5
422	 - How many times? - Five, I think.	29	3	5
423	 No, this makes six.	29	3	5
424	 Six.	29	3	5
425	 There was the first time-- the Mountain.	29	3	5
426	 Show her.	29	3	5
427	 Lance right through the chest.	29	3	5
428	 Then I was stabbed in the belly.	29	3	5
429	 Then it was an arrow in the back.	29	3	5
430	 And that axe in the side.	29	3	5
431	 Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason.	29	3	5
432	 Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?	29	3	5
433	 Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.	29	3	5
434	 And the Hound makes six.	29	3	5
435	 Second time I've been killed by a Clegane.	29	3	5
436	 You'd think you'd learn.	29	3	5
437	 It's not getting any easier, you know.	29	3	5
438	 I know.	30	3	5
439	 Every time I come back,	30	3	5
440	 I'm a bit less.	30	3	5
441	 Pieces of you get chipped away.	30	3	5
442	 Could you bring back a man without a head?	30	3	5
443	 Not six times. Just once.	30	3	5
444	 I don't think it works that way, child.	30	3	5
445	 He was a good man, Ned Stark.	30	3	5
446	 He's at rest now, somewhere.	30	3	5
447	 I would never wish my life upon him.	30	3	5
448	 I would.	30	3	5
449	 You're alive.	30	3	5
450	 Lord, cast your light upon me.	30	3	5
451	 Protect me in the darkness.	30	3	5
452	 Burn away my sins.	30	3	5
453	 Help me serve you.	31	3	5
454	 Use me as you will.	31	3	5
455	 For the night is dark	31	3	5
456	 and full of terrors.	31	3	5
457	 I have prayed day and night for you to come to me.	31	3	5
458	 My lady.	31	3	5
459	 I meant to come sooner.	31	3	5
460	 - The battle-- - I know of your troubles, my king.	31	3	5
461	 The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.	31	3	5
462	 Yes, of course.	31	3	5
463	 You mustn't despair. Your claim is true.	31	3	5
464	 - You will be victorious. - I believed that once.	31	3	5
465	 You are the one god's champion	32	3	5
466	 and the finest man I've ever known.	32	3	5
467	 Selyse.	32	3	5
468	 I've broken a sacred vow.	32	3	5
469	 I've sinned.	32	3	5
470	 - No. - I've wronged you.	32	3	5
471	 - I have shamed you. - You're doing god's work.	32	3	5
472	 You don't understand.	32	3	5
473	 The Red Woman--	32	3	5
474	 the Lady Melisandre--	32	3	5
475	 I know, Stannis.	32	3	5
476	 The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.	32	3	5
477	 No act done in service of the Lord of Light	32	3	5
478	 can ever be a sin.	32	3	5
479	 When she told me,	32	3	5
480	 I wept with joy.	32	3	5
481	 Oh, my sweet boys.	33	3	5
482	 Petyr, Tommard,	33	3	5
483	 Edric.	33	3	5
484	 I thank god every day	33	3	5
485	 for bringing Melisandre to us.	33	3	5
486	 She gave you a son.	33	3	5
487	 I gave you...	33	3	5
488	 - nothing. - That's not true.	33	3	5
489	 So you've come to see her as well?	33	3	5
490	 There is no need.	33	3	5
491	 You must keep away from such distractions.	33	3	5
492	 She's my daughter.	33	3	5
493	 I want to see her.	33	3	5
494	 You are a king.	34	3	5
495	 You don't need my permission.	34	3	5
496	  Under the sea 	34	3	5
497	  I know, I know 	34	3	5
498	  Oh, oh, oh 	34	3	5
499	  The birds have scales 	34	3	5
500	  And the fish take wing 	34	3	5
501	  I know, I know 	34	3	5
502	  Oh, oh, oh... 	34	3	5
503	 Shireen.	34	3	5
504	 Father!	34	3	5
505	 You've grown since I last saw you.	34	3	5
506	 Mother said you fought in a battle.	34	3	5
507	 Did you win?	34	3	5
508	 No.	34	3	5
509	 Did the Onion Knight come back with you?	34	3	5
510	 He did.	34	3	5
511	 He fought bravely.	35	3	5
512	 He hasn't come to visit me.	35	3	5
513	 He said he'd bring me back a present from the capital.	35	3	5
514	 He won't be visiting, child.	35	3	5
515	 Why not? He's my friend.	35	3	5
516	 Look.	35	3	5
517	 He made this for me.	35	3	5
518	 But don't tell Mother I have it.	35	3	5
519	 It's a secret.	35	3	5
520	 Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.	35	3	5
521	 Ser Davos is a traitor.	35	3	5
522	 He's rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime.	35	3	5
523	 Best forget him.	35	3	5
524	 Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.	36	3	5
525	 What are you doing here?	36	3	5
526	 I need a bath.	36	3	5
527	 Help me out of these rags.	36	3	5
528	 Now get out.	36	3	5
529	 There's another tub.	36	3	5
530	 This one suits me fine.	36	3	5
531	 Don't worry. I'm not interested.	36	3	5
532	 If I faint, pull me out.	36	3	5
533	 I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub.	37	3	5
534	 Why should I care how you die?	37	3	5
535	 You swore a solemn vow, remember?	37	3	5
536	 You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece.	37	3	5
537	 Not going so well, is it?	37	3	5
538	 No wonder Renly died with you guarding him.	37	3	5
539	 That was unworthy. Forgive me.	37	3	5
540	 You protected me better than most--	37	3	5
541	 - Don't you mock me. - I'm apologizing.	37	3	5
542	 I'm sick of fighting.	37	3	5
543	 Let's call a truce.	37	3	5
544	 You need trust to have a truce.	37	3	5
545	 I trust you.	37	3	5
546	 There it is. There's the look.	37	3	5
547	 I've seen it for 17 years	37	3	5
548	 on face after face.	38	3	5
549	 You all despise me.	38	3	5
550	 Kingslayer.	38	3	5
551	 Oathbreaker.	38	3	5
552	 A man without honor.	38	3	5
553	 You've heard of wildfire?	38	3	5
554	 Of course.	38	3	5
555	 The Mad King was obsessed with it.	38	3	5
556	 He loved to watch people burn,	38	3	5
557	 the way their skin blackened and blistered	38	3	5
558	 and melted off their bones.	38	3	5
559	 He burned lords he didn't like.	38	3	5
560	 He burned Hands who disobeyed him.	38	3	5
561	 He burned anyone who was against him.	38	3	5
562	 Before long, half the country was against him.	38	3	5
563	 Aerys saw traitors everywhere.	38	3	5
564	 So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire	38	3	5
565	 all over the city--	38	3	5
566	 beneath the Sept of Baelor	38	3	5
567	 and the slums of Flea Bottom.	39	3	5
568	 Under houses, stables, taverns.	39	3	5
569	 Even beneath the Red Keep itself.	39	3	5
570	 Finally,	39	3	5
571	 the day of reckoning came.	39	3	5
572	 Robert Baratheon marched on the capital	39	3	5
573	 after his victory at the Trident.	39	3	5
574	 But my father arrived first	39	3	5
575	 with the whole Lannister army at his back,	39	3	5
576	 promising to defend the city against the rebels.	39	3	5
577	 I knew my father better than that.	39	3	5
578	 He's never been one to pick the losing side.	39	3	5
579	 I told the Mad King as much.	39	3	5
580	 I urged him to surrender peacefully.	39	3	5
581	 But the king didn't listen to me.	39	3	5
582	 He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him.	39	3	5
583	 But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle,	39	3	5
584	 that grey, sunken cunt.	39	3	5
585	" ""You can trust the Lannisters,"" he said."	40	3	5
586	" ""The Lannisters have always been"	40	3	5
587	" true friends of the crown."""	40	3	5
588	 So we opened the gates	40	3	5
589	 and my father sacked the city.	40	3	5
590	 Once again, I came to the king,	40	3	5
591	 begging him to surrender.	40	3	5
592	 He told me to...	40	3	5
593	 bring him my father's head.	40	3	5
594	 Then he...	40	3	5
595	 turned to his pyromancer.	40	3	5
596	" ""Burn them all,"" he said."	40	3	5
597	" ""Burn them in their homes."	40	3	5
598	" Burn them in their beds."""	40	3	5
599	 Tell me, if your precious Renly	40	3	5
600	 commanded you to kill your own father	40	3	5
601	 and stand by while thousands of men,	40	3	5
602	 women, and children burned alive,	41	3	5
603	 would you have done it?	41	3	5
604	 Would you have kept your oath then?	41	3	5
605	 First, I killed the pyromancer.	41	3	5
606	 And then when the king turned to flee,	41	3	5
607	 I drove my sword into his back.	41	3	5
608	" ""Burn them all,"" he kept saying."	41	3	5
609	" ""Burn them all."""	41	3	5
610	 I don't think he expected to die.	41	3	5
611	 He-- he meant to...	41	3	5
612	 burn with the rest of us	41	3	5
613	 and rise again,	41	3	5
614	 reborn as a dragon	41	3	5
615	 to turn his enemies to ash.	41	3	5
616	 I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen.	41	3	5
617	 That's where Ned Stark found me.	41	3	5
618	 If this is true...	42	3	5
619	 why didn't you tell anyone?	42	3	5
620	 Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?	42	3	5
621	 Stark?	42	3	5
622	 You think	42	3	5
623	 the honorable Ned Stark	42	3	5
624	 wanted to hear my side?	42	3	5
625	 He judged me guilty	42	3	5
626	 the moment he set eyes on me.	42	3	5
627	 By what right does the wolf	42	3	5
628	 judge the lion?	42	3	5
629	 - By what right? - Help! Help!	42	3	5
630	 The Kingslayer!	42	3	5
631	 Jaime.	42	3	5
632	 My name is Jaime.	42	3	5
633	 Onion Knight.	42	3	5
634	 Ser Onion Knight.	42	3	5
635	 Princess? Gods, what are you doing here?	42	3	5
636	 - Shh, you'll wake Bert. - Bert?	42	3	5
637	 He's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight.	42	3	5
638	 He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.	43	3	5
639	 Go back to your room. You're not supposed to be here.	43	3	5
640	 - If your father knew-- - He said you were a traitor.	43	3	5
641	 Are you?	43	3	5
642	 I am, child.	43	3	5
643	 I disobeyed my king, your father,	43	3	5
644	 and now I'm paying the price.	43	3	5
645	 I don't care. You're my friend.	43	3	5
646	 You must get bored down here.	43	3	5
647	 I brought you something to read.	43	3	5
648	 It's about Aegon and his dragons.	43	3	5
649	 Aegon used to live here. Did you know that?	43	3	5
650	 - And the Targaryens built this castle. - Aye.	43	3	5
651	 - So they did. - You can hide the book under your cloak.	43	3	5
652	 It's a good one. I'll bring you more.	43	3	5
653	 Thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book,	43	3	5
654	 but it's wasted on me.	43	3	5
655	 Take it. I have more.	43	3	5
656	 My lady, I can't read the words.	43	3	5
657	 You can't?	43	3	5
658	 I'll teach you. I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you.	43	3	5
659	 - No. No. No. - It's easy. It'll be fun.	43	3	5
660	 - Go. We can't. - Why not?	43	3	5
661	 What will they do, lock us in cells?	43	3	5
662	 I wouldn't know where to start.	44	3	5
663	 At the beginning.	44	3	5
664	 This word is Aegon.	44	3	5
665	 When you see A, E, and G together like that,	44	3	5
666	 it sounds like egg.	44	3	5
667	 And the title of the whole book	44	3	5
668	" is ""An History of Aegon the Conqueror"	44	3	5
669	" and His Conquest of Westeros."""	44	3	5
670	 It was a bitch of a siege.	44	3	5
671	 Mm, you were first through the breach at Pyke?	44	3	5
672	 The second. Thoros of Myr went in alone,	44	3	5
673	 waving that flaming sword of his.	44	3	5
674	 Thoros of Myr. Bloody madman.	44	3	5
675	 Robert knighted you after the battle?	44	3	5
676	 Proudest moment of my life.	44	3	5
677	 One knee in the dust, the king's sword on my shoulder,	44	3	5
678	 listening to the words.	44	3	5
679	" ""In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave."""	45	3	5
680	 All I could think of was how badly I had to piss.	45	3	5
681	 In full plate metal for 16 hours.	45	3	5
682	 Never occurred to me till the fighting was over.	45	3	5
683	 I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots.	45	3	5
684	 Robert would have laughed.	45	3	5
685	 He was a good man, a great warrior.	45	3	5
686	 And a terrible king.	45	3	5
687	 I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings.	45	3	5
688	 - You swore an oath. - Yes.	45	3	5
689	 And a man of honor keeps his vows,	45	3	5
690	 even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic.	45	3	5
691	 Just once in my life before it's over,	45	3	5
692	 I want to know what it's like to serve with pride,	45	3	5
693	 to fight for someone I believe in.	45	3	5
694	 Do you believe in her?	45	3	5
695	 With all my heart.	45	3	5
696	 These are the ones?	45	3	5
697	 Yes, khaleesi. The officers.	45	3	5
698	 All Unsullied boys are given new names	46	3	5
699	 when they are cut--	46	3	5
700	 Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat.	46	3	5
701	 Names that remind them what they are--	46	3	5
702	 vermin.	46	3	5
703	 King Robert wanted her dead.	47	3	5
704	 Of course he wanted her dead.	47	3	5
705	 She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.	47	3	5
706	 I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him.	47	3	5
707	 - I didn't sit on the small council. - No?	47	3	5
708	 Doesn't the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard traditionally--	47	3	5
709	 Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen	47	3	5
710	 of Robert's friends during his rebellion.	47	3	5
711	 He didn't want advice on how to govern	47	3	5
712	 from a man who had fought for the Mad King.	48	3	5
713	 Can't say I minded much.	48	3	5
714	 I always hated the politics.	48	3	5
715	 Yeah, I imagine I would, too.	48	3	5
716	 Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings	48	3	5
717	 - and betrayals the world over. - Mm-hmm.	48	3	5
718	 Still, she'll have to wade through that muck	48	3	5
719	 if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms.	48	3	5
720	 She'll have good men around her to advise her,	48	3	5
721	 men with experience.	48	3	5
722	 Which men do you have in mind?	48	3	5
723	 Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say,	48	3	5
724	 but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years.	48	3	5
725	 It suffered for a reason.	48	3	5
726	 I sold men into slavery.	48	3	5
727	 I don't know if your presence by her side	48	3	5
728	 will help our cause when we go home.	48	3	5
729	 Our cause?	48	3	5
730	 Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy	48	3	5
731	 defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins	48	3	5
732	 while you were still bowing to the man.	48	3	5
733	 We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?	48	3	5
734	 You only joined us a few days ago.	48	3	5
735	 I can't speak to your intentions.	48	3	5
736	 If we're truly her loyal servants,	48	3	5
737	 we will do whatever needs to be done,	49	3	5
738	 no matter the cost, no matter our pride.	49	3	5
739	 You're not Lord Commander here.	49	3	5
740	 You're just another exile.	49	3	5
741	 And I take my orders from the queen.	49	3	5
742	 - Come to bed. - You were right.	49	3	5
743	 The Karstarks are gone.	49	3	5
744	 Almost half our forces.	49	3	5
745	 Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel.	49	3	5
746	 Nothing.	49	3	5
747	 Only wait.	49	3	5
748	 Don't let him.	49	3	5
749	 What can I do?	49	3	5
750	 Attack King's Landing?	49	3	5
751	 There's nothing he'd like better.	49	3	5
752	 He'd crush us in a day.	49	3	5
753	 We could ride north.	49	3	5
754	 Take your land back from the Greyjoys.	49	3	5
755	 - Wait out the winter. - Winter could last five years.	49	3	5
756	 Once my bannermen are home again,	50	3	5
757	 sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families,	50	3	5
758	 warm and safe, they'll never ride south again.	50	3	5
759	 When I gathered my lords together,	50	3	5
760	 we had a purpose, a mission.	50	3	5
761	 Now we're like a band of bickering children.	50	3	5
762	 Give them a new purpose.	50	3	5
763	 What?	50	3	5
764	 Oh, I don't know.	50	3	5
765	 I don't even know where Winterfell is.	50	3	5
766	 Here.	50	3	5
767	 And we're here. King's Landing--	50	3	5
768	 What is it?	50	3	5
769	 I can't force them to meet us in the field	50	3	5
770	 and I can't attack them where they're strongest,	50	3	5
771	 but I can attack them where they're not.	50	3	5
772	 And Casterly Rock can't run away.	51	3	5
773	 I'm going to take their home away from them.	51	3	5
774	 Can you do it?	51	3	5
775	 I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home.	51	3	5
776	 There is only one person in this kingdom	51	3	5
777	 with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters.	51	3	5
778	 The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry--	51	3	5
779	 Walder Frey.	51	3	5
780	 He's such a splendid fighter.	51	3	5
781	 Do you have any idea when we might...	51	3	5
782	 I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married.	51	3	5
783	 It should grow quickly.	51	3	5
784	 Joffrey won't let me leave.	51	3	5
785	 He's got too many reasons to keep me here.	51	3	5
786	 And only one to let you go.	51	3	5
787	 Because it will please me.	51	3	5
788	 Squire!	51	3	5
789	 Well fought, ser.	52	3	5
790	 That was no fight. I don't know you.	52	3	5
791	 Olyver, if it please you.	52	3	5
792	 I should like to see you spar with a proper partner, ser.	52	3	5
793	 How did you know?	52	3	5
794	 Know what?	52	3	5
795	 That I wanted to.	52	3	5
796	 My lord...	52	3	5
797	 I'll have you know I'm to be married soon	52	3	5
798	 and even my intended hasn't the slightest notion.	52	3	5
799	 They rarely do, in my experience.	52	3	5
800	 You have a good deal of experience, do you?	52	3	5
801	 With the husbands.	52	3	5
802	 That didn't take long.	52	3	5
803	 Well, it took long enough.	53	3	5
804	 It seems our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed.	53	3	5
805	 Is he?	53	3	5
806	 And...	53	3	5
807	 who's the lucky girl?	53	3	5
808	 She may not be the grandest ship in the world	53	3	5
809	 or the fastest,	53	3	5
810	 but she's mine.	53	3	5
811	 I've always wanted a ship.	53	3	5
812	 Now I want a dozen.	53	3	5
813	 - Strange, isn't it? - What is?	53	3	5
814	 It doesn't matter what we want,	53	3	5
815	 once we get it,	53	3	5
816	 then we want something else.	53	3	5
817	 Your hair is different.	53	3	5
818	 Is it?	53	3	5
819	 Lady Margaery wears it that way.	53	3	5
820	 Many ladies wear it this way.	53	3	5
821	 I have good news.	53	3	5
822	 I'll be leaving the city soon.	53	3	5
823	 You still want me to come with you?	53	3	5
824	 It's not a question of what I want.	53	3	5
825	 It's what you want.	53	3	5
826	 You want to go home, don't you?	54	3	5
827	 Of course. More than anything.	54	3	5
828	 But maybe it would be better to wait.	54	3	5
829	 I've been thinking how dangerous it would be.	54	3	5
830	 Not just for me, but for you.	54	3	5
831	 You've been so kind.	54	3	5
832	 I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you.	54	3	5
833	 I can't tell you how touched I am	54	3	5
834	 by your concern for my welfare.	54	3	5
835	 I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa.	54	3	5
836	 Your true friend.	54	3	5
837	 I do, Lord Baelish.	54	3	5
838	 - Petyr. - Petyr.	54	3	5
839	 If you wish to stay,	54	3	5
840	 then of course you will stay.	54	3	5
841	 We'll speak again when I return.	54	3	5
842	 You're late.	55	3	5
843	 What's she doing here?	55	3	5
844	 Our business concerns her, too.	55	3	5
845	 Sit.	55	3	5
846	 You'll be pleased to learn	55	3	5
847	 that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell,	55	3	5
848	 I've saved the crown	55	3	5
849	 hundreds of thousands on this wedding.	55	3	5
850	 Never mind that now.	55	3	5
851	 We have something important to discuss.	55	3	5
852	 I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.	55	3	5
853	 Stop that.	55	3	5
854	 You're making me uncomfortable.	55	3	5
855	 Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells	55	3	5
856	 are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.	55	3	5
857	 Very well.	55	3	5
858	 She's a lovely girl.	55	3	5
859	 Missing some of Loras' favorite bits,	55	3	5
860	 but I'm sure they'll make do.	55	3	5
861	 - Your jokes are not appreciated. - It wasn't my best, but--	55	3	5
862	 I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me,	55	3	5
863	 by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me.	55	3	5
864	 Sansa is the key to the North?	55	3	5
865	 I seem to remember she has an older brother.	56	3	5
866	 The Karstarks have marched home.	56	3	5
867	 The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered.	56	3	5
868	 Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers.	56	3	5
869	 That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell.	56	3	5
870	 And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.	56	3	5
871	 The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war.	56	3	5
872	 Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?	56	3	5
873	 There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot.	56	3	5
874	 Plots are not public knowledge.	56	3	5
875	 And the Tyrells won't carry this one out	56	3	5
876	 until after Joffrey's wedding.	56	3	5
877	 We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.	56	3	5
878	 And how do we do that?	56	3	5
879	 We find Sansa Stark a different husband.	56	3	5
880	 - Wonderful. - Yes, it is.	56	3	5
881	 You can't mean it.	56	3	5
882	 I can and I do.	56	3	5
883	 Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable	56	3	5
884	 since the day he took her father's head.	56	3	5
885	 Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me?	56	3	5
886	 That's cruel even for you.	57	3	5
887	 Do you intend on mistreating her?	57	3	5
888	 The girl's happiness is not my concern,	57	3	5
889	 - nor should it be yours. - She's a child!	57	3	5
890	 She's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length.	57	3	5
891	 There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her.	57	3	5
892	 - Surely you're capable of that. - And if I refuse?	57	3	5
893	 You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle.	57	3	5
894	 Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for.	57	3	5
895	 And it is past time you were wed.	57	3	5
896	 I was wed.	57	3	5
897	 Or don't you remember?	57	3	5
898	 Only too well.	57	3	5
899	 You should be thanking the gods for this.	57	3	5
900	 This is more than you deserve.	57	3	5
901	 Tyrion will do as he's bid.	57	3	5
902	 As will you.	57	3	5
903	 What do you mean?	57	3	5
904	 You'll marry Ser Loras.	57	3	5
905	 - I will not. - The boy is heir to Highgarden.	57	3	5
906	 Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach.	57	3	5
907	 - No, I won't do it. - Yes, you will.	58	3	5
908	 You're still fertile. You need to marry again and breed.	58	3	5
909	 I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare.	58	3	5
910	 You're my daughter!	58	3	5
911	 You will do as I command	58	3	5
912	 and you will marry Loras Tyrell	58	3	5
913	 and put an end to the disgusting rumors	58	3	5
914	 about you once and for all.	58	3	5
915	 Father, don't make me do it again, please.	58	3	5
916	 Not another word.	58	3	5
917	 My children.	58	3	5
918	 You've disgraced the Lannister name for far too long.	58	3	5

72	 Before all this nastiness,	7	3	4
73	 I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut.	7	3	4
74	 Do you want to hear it still?	7	3	4
75	 I don't know. Do I?	7	3	4
76	 As a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors	7	3	4
77	 through the Free Cities.	7	3	4
78	 One day in Myr,	7	3	4
79	 a certain man made my master an offer	8	3	4
80	 too tempting to refuse.	8	3	4
81	 I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard	8	3	4
82	 some men used small boys.	8	3	4
83	 But what he wanted was far worse.	8	3	4
84	 He gave me a potion	8	3	4
85	 that made me powerless to move or speak,	8	3	4
86	 yet did nothing to dull my senses.	8	3	4
87	 With a hooked blade he sliced me,	8	3	4
88	 root and stem, chanting all the while.	8	3	4
89	 He burned my parts in a brazier.	8	3	4
90	 The flames turned blue	8	3	4
91	 and I heard a voice answer his call.	8	3	4
92	 I still dream of that night.	8	3	4
93	 Not of the sorcerer,	8	3	4
94	 not of his blade.	8	3	4
95	 I dream of the voice from the flames.	8	3	4
96	 Was it a god? A demon?	8	3	4
97	 A conjuror's trick?	8	3	4
98	 I don't know.	9	3	4
99	 But the sorcerer called and a voice answered.	9	3	4
100	 And ever since that day,	9	3	4
101	 I have hated magic and all those who practice it.	9	3	4
102	 But you can see why I was eager to aid	9	3	4
103	 in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess.	9	3	4
104	 A symbolic revenge of sorts.	9	3	4
105	 Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge	9	3	4
106	 against the actual person	9	3	4
107	 who tried to have me killed.	9	3	4
108	 Which will require a degree of influence, which--	9	3	4
109	 You do not possess	9	3	4
110	 at the moment.	9	3	4
111	 But influence is largely	9	3	4
112	 a matter of patience, I have found.	9	3	4
113	 Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose,	9	3	4
114	 he threw me out of his house to die.	9	3	4
115	 I resolved to live	9	3	4
116	 to spite him.	10	3	4
117	 I begged.	10	3	4
118	 I sold what parts of my body remained to me.	10	3	4
119	 I became an excellent thief	10	3	4
120	 and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters	10	3	4
121	 are more valuable than the contents of his purse.	10	3	4
122	 Step by step,	10	3	4
123	 one distasteful task after another,	10	3	4
124	 I made my way from the slums of Myr	10	3	4
125	 to the small council chamber.	10	3	4
126	 Influence grows like a weed.	10	3	4
127	 I tended mine patiently	10	3	4
128	 until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep	10	3	4
129	 all the way across to the far side of the world	10	3	4
130	 where I managed to wrap them around something	10	3	4
131	 very special.	10	3	4
132	 The sorcerer.	11	3	4
133	 Hello, my old friend.	11	3	4
134	 It's been a long time.	11	3	4
135	 I have no doubt the revenge you want	11	3	4
136	 will be yours in time...	11	3	4
137	 if you have the stomach for it.	11	3	4
138	 When people talk about the Night's Watch,	11	3	4
139	 they never mention the shoveling.	11	3	4
140	 Or the shit.	11	3	4
141	 They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes,	11	3	4
142	 and protecting the realm,	11	3	4
143	 but shoveling really is most of it.	11	3	4
144	 And getting attacked or killed or worse.	11	3	4
145	 And that. But when you're not getting attacked or killed,	11	3	4
146	 usually you're shoveling.	11	3	4
147	 Oh, look.	11	3	4
148	 More shit.	11	3	4
149	 I was starting to wonder what to do	11	3	4
150	 with the rest of my day.	11	3	4
151	 We need to get out of here.	11	3	4
152	 When the Lord Commander says we go, we go.	12	3	4
153	 The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men.	12	3	4
154	 - How'd that turn out for us? - He had no way of knowing.	12	3	4
155	 We do now.	12	3	4
156	 We know what's out there.	12	3	4
157	 Craster's been out here surviving.	12	3	4
158	 So he's your new protector now?	12	3	4
159	 Our good friend Craster?	12	3	4
160	 We're like the sons he never had.	12	3	4
161	 Mormont isn't gonna save you.	12	3	4
162	 This lummox here isn't gonna save you.	12	3	4
163	 When the walkers come calling,	12	3	4
164	 Craster will serve us up like so many pigs.	12	3	4
165	 If we want to live...	12	3	4
166	 we'll have to look out for ourselves.	12	3	4
167	 Shh, shh, shh.	12	3	4
168	 - You woke him. - I'm sorry.	13	3	4
169	 - He's beautiful. - Shh!	13	3	4
170	 He's beautiful.	13	3	4
171	 Does he have a name?	13	3	4
172	 - No. - Are you going to give him one?	13	3	4
173	 Why?	13	3	4
174	 Here.	13	3	4
175	 - Gilly. - You said to hold it for you until you came back.	13	3	4
176	 - You're back. - I wanted you to have it.	13	3	4
177	 I don't want your stupid thimble.	13	3	4
178	 I want to save my baby's life. Can you do that?	13	3	4
179	 Can you?	13	3	4
180	 I don't have time for you.	13	3	4
181	 I don't have time for anyone but him	13	3	4
182	 because he doesn't have much time.	13	3	4
183	 You have to go after him.	14	3	4
184	 How?	14	3	4
185	 You know how.	14	3	4
186	 Brandon.	14	3	4
187	 - Mother. - How many times have I told you?	14	3	4
188	 - No climbing. - Mother, I need to find it.	15	3	4
189	 - It's here. It's calling me. - I want you to promise me.	15	3	4
190	 No more climbing. Promise me.	15	3	4
191	 Promise me! Promise me!	15	3	4
192	 - Mother! Mother! - Promise me! Promise me, Bran!	15	3	4
193	 Promise me!	15	3	4
194	 Is he very large?	15	3	4
195	 No larger than usual, apparently.	15	3	4
196	 - And yet they said that he was-- - Extraordinary.	15	3	4
197	 The most extraordinary man they've ever had.	15	3	4
198	 And they've had a lot of men.	15	3	4
199	 We're talking about the same Podrick?	15	3	4
200	 The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service?	15	3	4
201	 Seems a bit simple?	15	3	4
202	 What did he do to them?	15	3	4
203	 I don't know, my lord.	15	3	4
204	 The girls are usually quite descriptive.	15	3	4
205	 So what did they say?	15	3	4
206	 They said it was hard to describe.	15	3	4
207	 Huh.	16	3	4
208	 Prodigies appear in the oddest of places.	16	3	4
209	 And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?	16	3	4
210	 He was too preoccupied to notice.	16	3	4
211	 He's leaving for the Eyrie soon.	16	3	4
212	 I'm helping him prepare for his journey.	16	3	4
213	 Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love	16	3	4
214	 of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her.	16	3	4
215	 Sad, really.	16	3	4
216	 Is that all it takes	16	3	4
217	 to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?	16	3	4
218	 He hasn't spoken to her since the last time,	16	3	4
219	 as far as I know.	16	3	4
220	 But I don't think he's lost interest.	16	3	4
221	 What makes you say so?	16	3	4
222	 - His shipboard inventory. - Ah.	16	3	4
223	 You can read.	16	3	4
224	 Rare for a woman in your profession.	16	3	4
225	 - Former profession. - Of course.	16	3	4
226	 I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?	17	3	4
227	 Two featherbeds.	17	3	4
228	 He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.	17	3	4
229	 Who is important enough to Littlefinger	17	3	4
230	 to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger?	17	3	4
231	 Could he be bringing one of his girls?	17	3	4
232	 He's not interested in them, my lord.	17	3	4
233	 How do you know?	17	3	4
234	 Because I'm one of his girls.	17	3	4
235	 Prodigies in odd places indeed.	17	3	4
236	 Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother,	17	3	4
237	 or rather his dragon.	17	3	4
238	 It ate her while her son watched.	17	3	4
239	 What's left of her is buried in the crypts right down there.	17	3	4
240	 The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum,	17	3	4
241	 which seats 700 comfortably.	17	3	4
242	 There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere	17	3	4
243	 on the premises for everyone else.	18	3	4
244	 There aren't more than 700 people of any importance.	18	3	4
245	 No, the rest are there to look adoringly	18	3	4
246	 upon the 700 to remind them	18	3	4
247	 how superior they must be to have the best seats.	18	3	4
248	 Over there in that urn,	18	3	4
249	 the ashes of Aerion Targaryen.	18	3	4
250	 Aerion Brightflame they called him.	18	3	4
251	 He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon.	18	3	4
252	 He was wrong.	18	3	4
253	 And, of course, there's the Mad King,	18	3	4
254	 killed by my uncle.	18	3	4
255	 Would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried?	18	3	4
256	 Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn't find all this a bit macabre?	18	3	4
257	 Oh, no, it's quite all right, Your Grace.	18	3	4
258	 I'd love to see their tombs, really.	18	3	4
259	 It's like taking a walk through history.	18	3	4
260	 - The tomb's just up here. - This is so exciting.	18	3	4
261	 You were married here, Your Grace?	18	3	4
262	 - Yes. - Must seem like only yesterday.	18	3	4
263	 Seems like a lifetime ago.	19	3	4
264	 Your husband, was he buried here as well?	19	3	4
265	 No, he wanted his remains returned to Storm's End.	19	3	4
266	 - Such a tragedy. - A fairly predictable tragedy.	19	3	4
267	 Hunting and drinking don't mix.	19	3	4
268	 I should say not.	19	3	4
269	 My son's a hunter. It helps him forget	19	3	4
270	 he's never been within a mile of a real battle.	19	3	4
271	 I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm's End	19	3	4
272	 for the better part of a year.	19	3	4
273	 All he laid siege to	19	3	4
274	 was the banquet table in the command tent.	19	3	4
275	 I told him to stay out of Robert's rebellion.	19	3	4
276	 He had no business fighting an actual warrior.	19	3	4
277	 We mothers do what we can	19	3	4
278	 to keep our sons from the grave.	19	3	4
279	 But they do seem to yearn for it.	19	3	4
280	 We shower them with good sense,	19	3	4
281	 and it slides right off like rain off a wing.	19	3	4
282	 And yet the world belongs to them.	19	3	4
283	 A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind.	19	3	4
284	 The gods have seen fit to make it so.	20	3	4
285	 My father didn't want them here.	20	3	4
286	 He was going to have their bodies burned	20	3	4
287	 and thrown in the Blackwater,	20	3	4
288	 but the High Septon convinced him otherwise.	20	3	4
289	 I'm glad he did.	20	3	4
290	 I'm sorry, Your Grace.	20	3	4
291	 I know they did terrible things at the end,	20	3	4
292	 but their ancestors built this.	20	3	4
293	 Sometimes severity	20	3	4
294	 is the price we pay for greatness.	20	3	4
295	 I couldn't agree more.	20	3	4
296	 Shall we go and see them?	20	3	4
297	 If you give them your love,	20	3	4
298	 they will return it a thousandfold.	20	3	4
299	 I've spoken with them.	21	3	4
300	 I know how they feel about you.	21	3	4
301	 You led the defense of King's Landing.	21	3	4
302	 They adore you.	21	3	4
303	 Open the doors.	21	3	4
304	 Joffrey.	21	3	4
305	 Wait.	21	3	4
306	 - Lady Margaery! - Lady Margaery!	21	3	4
307	 Bless you, Lady Margaery!	21	3	4
308	 - Lady Margaery! - Lady Margaery!	21	3	4
309	 - Margaery! - Long live Lady Margaery!	21	3	4
310	 King Joffrey!	21	3	4
311	 King Joffrey! King Joffrey!	22	3	4
312	 King Joffrey!	22	3	4
313	 Gods bless King Joffrey!	22	3	4
314	 How far is it to Deepwood Motte?	22	3	4
315	 Not far, my lord.	22	3	4
316	 Your sister is waiting for you there.	22	3	4
317	 - She sent you to save me? - Yes.	22	3	4
318	 I served them, the men who were torturing you.	22	3	4
319	 I did what they told me and waited for the right moment.	22	3	4
320	 Why would you risk your life for me?	22	3	4
321	 I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord.	22	3	4
322	 I was only a boy when they took you away.	22	3	4
323	 My father brought me and my brothers up to the bluffs	22	3	4
324	 so we could watch the ship that carried you off.	22	3	4
325	 I remember the look on my father's face when he told us,	22	3	4
326	" ""That's Balon Greyjoy's last living son."""	22	3	4
327	 And those are the words I heard over and over again	22	3	4
328	 when I saw what they were doing to you.	22	3	4
329	 Those men,	23	3	4
330	 they said my father knew what they were doing to me.	23	3	4
331	 Did he?	23	3	4
332	 I-- I don't know, my lord.	23	3	4
333	 They-- they never told me much.	23	3	4
334	 My sister's men are loyal to her.	23	3	4
335	 We don't need to hide from them.	23	3	4
336	 Not all those are your sister's men.	23	3	4
337	 Some of them are loyal to your father.	23	3	4
338	 What is it?	23	3	4
339	 I was just thinking how jealous I was	23	3	4
340	 when my father told Yara to take this place.	23	3	4
341	 What did he tell you to do?	23	3	4
342	 Raid fishing villages.	23	3	4
343	 He didn't trust me.	23	3	4
344	 Thought I was a Stark.	23	3	4
345	 Ha. I could never be a Stark.	23	3	4
346	 Robb Stark always reminded me of that.	23	3	4
347	 - He lorded it over you? - Didn't have to.	24	3	4
348	 All he had to do was be.	24	3	4
349	 Be who he was born to be.	24	3	4
350	 His life fit him better than his clothes.	24	3	4
351	 How could someone like that ever be a brother to me?	24	3	4
352	 He's the King in the North.	24	3	4
353	 And me...	24	3	4
354	 my father gave me a choice	24	3	4
355	 and I made it.	24	3	4
356	 I could never be a Stark.	24	3	4
357	 But ironborn,	24	3	4
358	 that's what I was born to be.	24	3	4
359	 I paid the iron price for Winterfell.	24	3	4
360	 I murdered those boys.	24	3	4
361	 The Stark boys?	24	3	4
362	 Never found them.	25	3	4
363	 Just some poor orphans living with a farmer.	25	3	4
364	 I let Dagmer slit their throats	25	3	4
365	 and I let him burn the bodies...	25	3	4
366	 so I could keep Winterfell...	25	3	4
367	 and make my father proud.	25	3	4
368	 Maybe it's not too late.	25	3	4
369	 It is.	25	3	4
370	 My real father lost his head at King's Landing.	25	3	4
371	 I made a choice...	25	3	4
372	 and I chose wrong.	25	3	4
373	 And now I've burned everything down.	26	3	4
374	 Not everything, my lord.	26	3	4
375	 She's up here.	26	3	4
376	 - Yara. - Shh.	26	3	4
377	 Wait.	26	3	4
378	 I brought him back. He killed the others.	26	3	4
379	 What? No, I didn't.	26	3	4
380	 You can't!	26	3	4
381	 No, please stop!	26	3	4
382	 No!	26	3	4
383	 Put him back where he belongs.	26	3	4
384	 Eat.	27	3	4
385	 What are you doing?	27	3	4
386	 I'm dying.	27	3	4
387	 You can't die.	27	3	4
388	 You need to live	27	3	4
389	 to take revenge.	27	3	4
390	 I don't care about revenge.	27	3	4
391	 You coward.	27	3	4
392	 A little misfortune and you're giving up.	27	3	4
393	 Misfor--	27	3	4
394	 misfortune?	28	3	4
395	 You lost your hand.	28	3	4
396	 My sword hand. I was that hand.	28	3	4
397	 You have a taste--	28	3	4
398	 one taste of the real world	28	3	4
399	 where people have important things taken from them	28	3	4
400	 and you whine and cry and quit.	28	3	4
401	 You sound like a bloody woman.	28	3	4
402	 I know what you did for me.	28	3	4
403	 You told them Tarth was full of sapphires.	28	3	4
404	 It's called the Sapphire Isle	29	3	4
405	 because of the blue of its water.	29	3	4
406	 You knew that.	29	3	4
407	 Why did you help me?	29	3	4
408	 You wanted to speak to me?	29	3	4
409	 Yes, about Jaime.	29	3	4
410	 What about him?	30	3	4
411	 I wanted to make sure	30	3	4
412	 we're doing everything we can to get him back.	30	3	4
413	 When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner...	30	3	4
414	 what did I do in response?	30	3	4
415	 - You started a war. - And if I would start a war	30	3	4
416	 for that lecherous little stump,	30	3	4
417	 what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir?	30	3	4
418	 Whatever you can.	30	3	4
419	 Whatever I can.	30	3	4
420	 - You're still here. - Yes.	30	3	4
421	 Why?	30	3	4
422	 Did it ever occur to you	30	3	4
423	 that I might be the one who deserves your confidence	30	3	4
424	 and your trust, not your sons?	30	3	4
425	 Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me.	31	3	4
426	 Years and years of lectures on family	31	3	4
427	 and legacy--	31	3	4
428	 the same lecture, really,	31	3	4
429	 just with tiny, tedious variations--	31	3	4
430	 did it ever occur to you that your daughter	31	3	4
431	 might be the only one listening to them? Living by them?	31	3	4
432	 That she might have the most to contribute to your legacy	31	3	4
433	 that you love so much more than your actual children?	31	3	4
434	 All right. Contribute.	31	3	4
435	 The Tyrells are a problem.	31	3	4
436	 The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon.	31	3	4
437	 The Tyrells saved your life, your children's lives.	31	3	4
438	 Margaery has her claws in Joffrey.	31	3	4
439	 She knows how to manipulate him.	31	3	4
440	 Good.	32	3	4
441	 I wish you knew how to manipulate him.	32	3	4
442	 I don't distrust you because you're a woman.	32	3	4
443	 I distrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are.	32	3	4
444	 You've allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you	32	3	4
445	 and everyone else in this city.	32	3	4
446	 Perhaps...	32	3	4
447	 you should try stopping him from doing what he likes.	32	3	4
448	 I will.	32	3	4
449	 Do you like it, Nana?	32	3	4
450	 Another golden rose. How original.	32	3	4
451	 I eat from plates stamped with roses.	32	3	4
452	 I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses.	32	3	4
453	 I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot,	32	3	4
454	 as if that makes it smell any better.	32	3	4
455	 Roses are boring, dear.	32	3	4
456	" ""Growing strong."""	32	3	4
457	 Ha! The dullest words of any house.	33	3	4
458	" ""Winter is coming!"""	33	3	4
459	 Now that's memorable.	33	3	4
460	" ""We do not sow."" Strong. Strong."	33	3	4
461	 Those are houses you watch out for.	33	3	4
462	 Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts.	33	3	4
463	 But a golden rose growing strong--	33	3	4
464	 ha, that strikes fear in the heart.	33	3	4
465	 Look, little loves.	33	3	4
466	 A spider in the garden.	33	3	4
467	 Run along now.	33	3	4
468	 Grow strong.	33	3	4
469	 My lady.	33	3	4
470	 I wanted to personally welcome you to King's Landing.	33	3	4
471	 The city has been made brighter by your presence.	33	3	4
472	 The city is made brighter by my presence?	33	3	4
473	 Is that your usual line, Lord Varys?	33	3	4
474	 Are you here to seduce me?	33	3	4
475	 A little obvious, perhaps.	33	3	4
476	 Oh, no, please.	33	3	4
477	 Seduce away. It's been so long.	34	3	4
478	 Though I rather think it's all for naught.	34	3	4
479	 What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit?	34	3	4
480	 A question for the philosophers.	34	3	4
481	 But you've come mincing all this way for something.	34	3	4
482	 - So? - Might I sit?	34	3	4
483	 No.	34	3	4
484	 Come, I've heard you're such a clever man.	34	3	4
485	 I'm curious why you've sought me out.	34	3	4
486	 You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark.	34	3	4
487	 Have I?	34	3	4
488	 Because I spoke to her once in this garden	34	3	4
489	 and one of your little spies came running to tell you?	34	3	4
490	 Why shouldn't I take an interest?	34	3	4
491	 - She's an interesting girl. - Is she?	34	3	4
492	 No, not particularly.	34	3	4
493	 But she's had an interesting childhood.	34	3	4
494	 She has, sadly.	34	3	4
495	 Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then.	34	3	4
496	 I thought we shared certain hopes for her well-being.	34	3	4
497	 Come, come.	34	3	4
498	 You surrender rather easily.	35	3	4
499	 Walk with me.	35	3	4
500	 I know the walls have ears,	35	3	4
501	 but apparently the shrubbery does, too.	35	3	4
502	 I choose my allies carefully	35	3	4
503	 and my enemies more carefully still.	35	3	4
504	 Which is Sansa Stark?	35	3	4
505	 Neither. A babe in the woods.	35	3	4
506	 - I admired her father. - Yes.	35	3	4
507	 Ned Stark had many admirers,	35	3	4
508	 and how many stepped forward	35	3	4
509	 when the executioner came for his head?	35	3	4
510	 I could not help Lord Stark.	35	3	4
511	 - Perhaps I can help his daughter. - How?	35	3	4
512	 You're not the only one who has taken an interest in her.	35	3	4
513	 That's hardly surprising.	35	3	4
514	 She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.	35	3	4
515	 Indeed. She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor.	35	3	4
516	 It almost feels as if you're about to arrive at the point.	35	3	4
517	 Littlefinger is not long for the capital.	35	3	4
518	 A confidant of mine has told me	35	3	4
519	 that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him.	35	3	4
520	 And why have you come to me with this matter?	36	3	4
521	 Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies.	36	3	4
522	 He has acquired the first two.	36	3	4
523	 How long before he has the army?	36	3	4
524	 Perhaps you'll laugh,	36	3	4
525	 but I know him better than most	36	3	4
526	 and this is the truth.	36	3	4
527	 Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros.	36	3	4
528	 If Robb Stark falls,	36	3	4
529	 Sansa Stark is the key to the North.	36	3	4
530	 And if Littlefinger marries her, he'll have the key in his pocket.	36	3	4
531	 Which seems such a shame.	36	3	4
532	 Why should a man with such a low reputation	36	3	4
533	 steal away such a lovely bride?	36	3	4
534	 You must despise him.	36	3	4
535	 You're working so hard to undermine him.	36	3	4
536	 Actually, I rather enjoy him.	36	3	4
537	 But he would see this country burn	36	3	4
538	 if he could be king of the ashes.	36	3	4
539	 You are a clever man, Lord Varys.	36	3	4
540	 You are too kind.	36	3	4
541	 I believe I have a possible solution.	36	3	4
542	 One doesn't need to be clever for that.	36	3	4
543	 It's all rather obvious, isn't it?	37	3	4
544	 Ahem.	37	3	4
545	 I didn't mean to disturb you.	37	3	4
546	 You haven't.	37	3	4
547	 We'd like some privacy, please.	37	3	4
548	 If you wouldn't mind waiting back inside the keep.	37	3	4
549	 Or if you'd be kind enough to give me your names,	37	3	4
550	 I'll ask the king to speak with you himself.	37	3	4
551	 What did you pray for?	37	3	4
552	 - I can't tell you. - Why not?	37	3	4
553	 I'll tell you what I prayed for in the sept this morning.	37	3	4
554	 Let's see, for my family's health and happiness,	37	3	4
555	 for an end to the war, for a short winter.	37	3	4
556	 Boring and traditional, I'm afraid.	37	3	4
557	 - And you? - I'm sorry, I just can't.	37	3	4
558	 My cousin Alanna	38	3	4
559	 was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen.	38	3	4
560	 When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees	38	3	4
561	 and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me.	38	3	4
562	 Pig-face, she called me.	38	3	4
563	 Pig-face? That's ridiculous.	38	3	4
564	 I think it had something to do with my nose.	38	3	4
565	 Whenever she passed me in the halls, she'd oink.	38	3	4
566	 So I prayed that she'd catch a horrible skin disease.	38	3	4
567	 A week after that, she came down with porridge plague.	38	3	4
568	 - Porridge plague? - You don't have it in the North?	38	3	4
569	 Your skin starts to look like boiled oats	38	3	4
570	 and eventually your face slides off and you die in agony.	38	3	4
571	 But that's awful.	38	3	4
572	 You're--	38	3	4
573	 I believed you!	38	3	4
574	 Porridge plague. I'm an idiot.	38	3	4
575	 Don't say that. No, you're not.	38	3	4
576	 So what happened to Alanna?	38	3	4
577	 Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman	38	3	4
578	 and married a handsome lord and they have darling children	39	3	4
579	 and live in a castle by the sea.	39	3	4
580	 It's all terribly frustrating.	39	3	4
581	 I'm sure she's jealous of you now.	39	3	4
582	 You'll be married here in the capital	39	3	4
583	 and she'll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you're queen.	39	3	4
584	 I want us to be friends, good friends.	39	3	4
585	 That would make me very happy.	39	3	4
586	 You must see Highgarden.	39	3	4
587	 You'd love it there. I know you would.	39	3	4
588	 We have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon.	39	3	4
589	 You should see the costumes.	39	3	4
590	 People work on them for months.	39	3	4
591	 I-- I don't think the queen	39	3	4
592	 would let me leave King's Landing.	39	3	4
593	 The Queen Regent, you mean.	39	3	4
594	 Once I marry Joffrey, I'll be queen.	39	3	4
595	 And if you were to marry Loras...	39	3	4
596	 Oh, your place would be at Highgarden, wouldn't it?	40	3	4
597	 We would be sisters, you and I.	40	3	4
598	 Would you like that?	40	3	4
599	 His name was Bannen.	40	3	4
600	 He was a good man,	40	3	4
601	 a good ranger.	40	3	4
602	 He came to us from--	40	3	4
603	 where did he come from?	40	3	4
604	 Down White Harbor way.	40	3	4
605	 He came to us from White Harbor.	40	3	4
606	 Never failed in his duty.	40	3	4
607	 He kept his vows the best he could.	40	3	4
608	 He rode far, fought fiercely.	40	3	4
609	 We shall never see his like again.	40	3	4
610	 And now his watch has ended.	41	3	4
611	 And now his watch has ended.	41	3	4
612	 Didn't think a broke foot could kill a man.	41	3	4
613	 It wasn't his foot that killed him.	41	3	4
614	 That bastard Craster starved him to death.	41	3	4
615	 Craster's got his daughters to feed.	41	3	4
616	 You on his side?	41	3	4
617	 We can't just show up and steal all his food.	41	3	4
618	 We're brothers of the Night's Watch, not thieves.	41	3	4
619	 The day we leave,	41	3	4
620	 Craster will tap a barrel of our wine	41	3	4
621	 and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes	41	3	4
622	 and laugh at us	41	3	4
623	 starving in the snow.	41	3	4
624	 He's a bloody wildling is all he is.	41	3	4
625	 Never knew Bannen could smell so good.	41	3	4
626	 You have one son, don't you, Mormont?	42	3	4
627	 I had my 99th.	42	3	4
628	 You ever meet a man with 99 sons?	42	3	4
629	 And more daughters than I can count.	42	3	4
630	 - I'm glad for you. - Are you now?	42	3	4
631	 Me, I'll be glad when you and yours have gone.	42	3	4
632	 As soon as our wounded are strong enough.	42	3	4
633	 Ah.	42	3	4
634	 They're as strong as they're gonna get.	42	3	4
635	 Them that's dying,	42	3	4
636	 why don't you cut their throats and be done with it?	42	3	4
637	 Hmm?	42	3	4
638	 Or leave them if you've not the stomach	42	3	4
639	 and I'll sort them myself.	42	3	4
640	 Whose throat you gonna cut, old man?	43	3	4
641	 Wait outside.	43	3	4
642	 It's cold outside and there's nothing to eat.	43	3	4
643	 My wives gave you bread.	43	3	4
644	 There's sawdust in the bread.	43	3	4
645	 You don't like it,	43	3	4
646	 you go out there and eat the snow.	43	3	4
647	 I'd rather eat what you've got hidden away.	43	3	4
648	 I told you to wait outside.	43	3	4
649	 He's sitting there drinking our wine,	43	3	4
650	 eating his fill while we die.	43	3	4
651	 I gave you crows enough.	43	3	4
652	 I've got to feed my women!	43	3	4
653	 So you admit you've got a hidden larder, then?	43	3	4
654	 How else'd you make it through winter?	43	3	4
655	 Enough! Out!	43	3	4
656	 I am a godly man.	43	3	4
657	 You're a stingy bastard!	43	3	4
658	 Bastard?	43	3	4
659	 Out with you, you little thief.	43	3	4
660	 And you! And you!	44	3	4
661	 Go sleep in the cold on empty bellies.	44	3	4
662	 I'll chop the hands off the next man	44	3	4
663	 who calls me bastard.	44	3	4
664	 You are a bastard.	44	3	4
665	 A daughter-fucking, wildling bastard.	44	3	4
666	 The gods will curse us for this.	44	3	4
667	 - By all the laws-- - There are no laws beyond the Wall.	44	3	4
668	 Now show us where he hides the food	44	3	4
669	 or you'll get the same as he did.	45	3	4
670	 Unhand her.	45	3	4
671	 I shall have your head for this.	45	3	4
672	 - Quickly. Quickly. - What's happening?	46	3	4
673	 - I'm not going out there. - No, we have to go. Now!	46	3	4
674	 Follow me. I know the best way.	46	3	4
675	 Come on.	46	3	4
676	 Run fast, Piggy,	46	3	4
677	 and sleep well!	46	3	4
678	 I'll be cutting your throat one of these nights.	46	3	4
679	 Can I take this hood off yet?	46	3	4
680	 I do apologize, little lady,	46	3	4
681	 but it's better for you if you don't see where we're going.	46	3	4
682	 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.	46	3	4
683	 Halt!	46	3	4
684	 - What is it? - Blackstrap rum.	47	3	4
685	 Ugh!	47	3	4
686	 Not easy finding molasses in wartime.	47	3	4
687	 I'd have some.	47	3	4
688	 Let's go home.	47	3	4
689	 What is this place?	47	3	4
690	 Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling.	47	3	4
691	 You look like a bunch of swineherds.	47	3	4
692	 Some of us were swineherds.	47	3	4
693	 And some of us tanners and masons.	48	3	4
694	 That was before.	48	3	4
695	 You're still swineherds	48	3	4
696	 and tanners and masons.	48	3	4
697	 You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier?	48	3	4
698	 No.	48	3	4
699	 Fighting in a war makes you a soldier.	48	3	4
700	 Beric Dondarrion?	48	3	4
701	 You've seen better days.	48	3	4
702	 And I won't see them again.	48	3	4
703	 Stark deserters.	48	3	4
704	 Baratheon deserters.	48	3	4
705	 You lot aren't fighting in a war.	48	3	4
706	 You're running from it.	48	3	4
707	 Last I heard, you were King Joffrey's guard dog.	48	3	4
708	 But here you are 1,000 miles from home.	48	3	4
709	 Which of us is running?	48	3	4
710	 Untie these ropes and we'll find out.	48	3	4
711	 What are you doing leading a mob of peasants?	48	3	4
712	 Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother	48	3	4
713	 in King Robert's name.	48	3	4
714	 Ned Stark is dead.	48	3	4
715	 King Robert is dead.	49	3	4
716	 My brother's alive.	49	3	4
717	 You're fighting for ghosts.	49	3	4
718	 That's what we are--	49	3	4
719	 ghosts waiting for you in the dark.	49	3	4
720	 You can't see us,	49	3	4
721	 but we see you.	49	3	4
722	 No matter whose cloak you wear--	49	3	4
723	 Lannister, Stark, Baratheon--	49	3	4
724	 you prey on the weak,	49	3	4
725	 the Brotherhood without Banners will hunt you down.	49	3	4
726	 You found god? Is that it?	49	3	4
727	 Aye. I've been reborn	49	3	4
728	 in the light of the one true god.	49	3	4
729	 As have we all.	49	3	4
730	 As would any man who's seen the things we've seen.	49	3	4
731	 If you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it.	49	3	4
732	 You'll die soon enough, dog.	49	3	4
733	 But it won't be murder, only justice.	49	3	4
734	 And a kinder fate than you deserve.	49	3	4
735	 Lions you call yourselves.	50	3	4
736	 At the Mummer's Ford, girls of seven years were raped	50	3	4
737	 and babes still on the breast	50	3	4
738	 were cut in two while their mothers watched.	50	3	4
739	 I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford.	50	3	4
740	 Dump your dead children at some other door.	50	3	4
741	 House Clegane was built upon dead children.	50	3	4
742	 I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys	50	3	4
743	 before the Iron Throne.	50	3	4
744	 Do you take me for my brother?	50	3	4
745	 Is being born Clegane a crime?	50	3	4
746	 - Murder is a crime. - I never touched the Targaryen babes.	50	3	4
747	 I never saw them, never smelled them,	50	3	4
748	 never heard them bawling.	50	3	4
749	 You want to cut my throat, get on with it!	50	3	4
750	 But don't call me murderer	50	3	4
751	 and pretend that you're not.	50	3	4
752	 You murdered Mycah.	50	3	4
753	 The butcher's boy.	50	3	4
754	 My friend.	50	3	4
755	 He was 12 years old. He was unarmed.	50	3	4
756	 And you rode him down.	50	3	4
757	 You slung him over your horse like he was some deer.	50	3	4
758	 Aye, he was a bleeder.	50	3	4
759	 You don't deny killing this boy?	51	3	4
760	 I was Joffrey's sworn shield.	51	3	4
761	 - The boy attacked the prince. - That's a lie!	51	3	4
762	 I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away.	51	3	4
763	 Then I should have killed you.	51	3	4
764	 Not my place to question princes.	51	3	4
765	 You stand accused of murder.	51	3	4
766	 But no one here knows the truth of the charge,	51	3	4
767	 so it is not for us to judge you.	51	3	4
768	 Only the Lord of Light may do that now.	51	3	4
769	 I sentence you to trial by combat.	51	3	4
770	 So, who will it be?	51	3	4
771	 Should we find out if your fire god	51	3	4
772	 really loves you, priest?	51	3	4
773	 Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand?	51	3	4
774	 Or is the little girl the bravest one here?	51	3	4
775	 Aye.	51	3	4
776	 She might be.	51	3	4
777	 But it's me you'll fight.	52	3	4
778	 The master says they are untested.	52	3	4
779	 He says you would be wise to blood them early.	52	3	4
780	 There are many small cities between here and there,	52	3	4
781	 cities ripe for sacking.	52	3	4
782	 Should you take captives,	52	3	4
783	 the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price.	52	3	4
784	 And who knows?	52	3	4
785	 In 10 years, some of the boys you send them	53	3	4
786	 may be Unsullied in their turn.	53	3	4
787	 Thus all shall prosper.	53	3	4
788	 Is it done, then? They belong to me?	54	3	4
789	 It is done.	54	3	4

7	 Easy, easy.	3	6	3
8	 Easy.	3	6	3
9	 What do you remember?	3	6	3
10	 They stabbed me.	3	6	3
11	 Olly...	3	6	3
12	 he put a knife in my heart.	3	6	3
13	 I shouldn't be here.	4	6	3
14	 The lady brought you back.	4	6	3
15	 Afterwards..	4	6	3
16	 ..after they stabbed you, after you died, where did you go?	4	6	3
17	 What did you see?	4	6	3
18	 Nothing.	4	6	3
19	 There was nothing at all.	4	6	3
20	 The Lord let you come back for a reason.	4	6	3
21	 Stannis was not the prince who was promised,	4	6	3
22	 but someone has to be.	4	6	3
23	 Could you give us a moment?	4	6	3
24	 You were dead.	5	6	3
25	 And now you're not.	5	6	3
26	 That's completely fucking mad,	5	6	3
27	 seems to me.	5	6	3
28	 I can only imagine how it seems to you.	5	6	3
29	 I did what I thought was right.	5	6	3
30	 And I got murdered for it.	5	6	3
31	 And now I'm back.	5	6	3
32	 Why?	5	6	3
33	 I don't know.	5	6	3
34	 Maybe we'll never know.	5	6	3
35	 What does it matter?	5	6	3
36	 You go on.	6	6	3
37	 You fight for as long as you can.	6	6	3
38	 You clean up as much of the shit as you can.	6	6	3
39	 I don't know how to do that.	6	6	3
40	 I thought I did, but...	6	6	3
41	 I failed.	6	6	3
42	 Good.	6	6	3
43	 Now go fail again.	6	6	3
44	 (door opens)	6	6	3
45	 They think you're some kind of god.	7	6	3
46	 The man who returned from the dead.	7	6	3
47	 I'm not a god.	7	6	3
48	 I know that.	7	6	3
49	 I saw your pecker.	7	6	3
50	 What kind of god would have a pecker that small?	7	6	3
51	 (both chuckle)	7	6	3
52	 (winces)	7	6	3
53	 Your eyes are still brown.	8	6	3
54	 Is that still you in there?	8	6	3
55	 I think so.	8	6	3
56	 Hold off on burning my body for now.	8	6	3
57	 (laughs)	8	6	3
58	 That's funny.	8	6	3
59	 You sure that's still you in there?	8	6	3
60	 (laughs)	8	6	3
61	 (thunder crashing)	8	6	3
62	 (chatter)	9	6	3
63	 (Sam groans)	9	6	3
64	 You all right?	9	6	3
65	 Yes..	9	6	3
66	 Yes, I'm fine.	9	6	3
67	 Did I ever tell you I used to think the sea was called the 'see',	9	6	3
68	 because it was nothing but water as far as the eye could see?	9	6	3
69	 I don't think so.	9	6	3
70	 Sea, see.	9	6	3
71	 They're spelled different, but they sound the same.	9	6	3
72	 Yeah, they do.	9	6	3
73	 It was before I learned how to read, obviously.	9	6	3
74	 Sam, are you going to be sick?	9	6	3
75	 Won't be long. We'll be in the south soon.	10	6	3
76	 I'm excited to see Oldtown.	10	6	3
77	 Captain says it's the most beautiful city in Westeros.	10	6	3
78	 Do you going to vomit again?	10	6	3
79	 No. No, no, no.	10	6	3
80	 The Citadel doesn't admit women.	10	6	3
81	 There won't be a place for you there or for Little Sam.	10	6	3
82	 I stayed at Castle Black. There's no women allowed there.	10	6	3
83	 The Citadel isn't Castle Black.	10	6	3
84	 I don't have a Jon Snow or	10	6	3
85	 Maester Aemon to help me bend the rules.	10	6	3
86	 I'll stay in Oldtown, then.	10	6	3
87	 By yourself?	11	6	3
88	 With a baby and no money?	11	6	3
89	 So if we're not going to Oldtown, where are you taking me?	11	6	3
90	 To my home.	11	6	3
91	 Horn Hill.	11	6	3
92	 My father's-- well, my father,	11	6	3
93	 but my mother's a kind woman and my sister's lovely.	11	6	3
94	 They'll take care of you both.	11	6	3
95	" ""Wherever you go, I go, too."""	11	6	3
96	 That's what you said.	11	6	3
97	 I said that because I want you and Little Sam to be safe.	11	6	3
98	 That's all I want--	11	6	3
99	 to become a maester so I can help Jon when the time comes, so you'll be safe.	11	6	3
100	 Us and everyone else in the world.	12	6	3
101	 I don't care about them.	12	6	3
102	 Well, no, I do, but I don't really.	12	6	3
103	 I care about you and him.	12	6	3
104	 I know that, Sam.	12	6	3
105	 And he does, too.	12	6	3
106	 You're the only one who ever has.	12	6	3
107	 If you think it's for the best, we trust you.	12	6	3
108	 I'd feel better if you threw something at me and stormed off.	12	6	3
109	 I'd never do that to the father of my son.	12	6	3
110	 (coughs)	13	6	3
111	 (horses whinny)	13	6	3
112	 (distant horse whinnies)	13	6	3
113	 (horse whinnies)	13	6	3
114	 That's my father.	14	6	3
115	 The man beside him is Howland Reed, Meera's father.	14	6	3
116	 Ser Arthur Dayne.	14	6	3
117	 The Sword of the Morning.	14	6	3
118	 Father said he was the best swordsman he ever saw.	14	6	3
119	 Lord Stark.	14	6	3
120	 I looked for you on the Trident.	14	6	3
121	 We weren't there.	14	6	3
122	 Your friend the usurper would lie beneath the ground if we had been.	14	6	3
123	 The Mad King is dead.	14	6	3
124	 Rhaegar lies beneath the ground.	15	6	3
125	 Why weren't you there to protect your prince?	15	6	3
126	 Our prince wanted us here.	15	6	3
127	 Where's my sister?	15	6	3
128	 I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.	15	6	3
129	 And now it begins.	15	6	3
130	 No.	15	6	3
131	 Now it ends.	15	6	3
132	 (shouts)	15	6	3
133	 (groans)	15	6	3
134	 (shouts)	16	6	3
135	 He's better than my father.	17	6	3
136	 Far better.	17	6	3
137	 But Father beat him.	17	6	3
138	 Did he?	17	6	3
139	 I know he did.	17	6	3
140	 Heard the story a thousand times.	17	6	3
141	 (grunts)	17	6	3
142	 He stabbed him in the back.	18	6	3
143	 (woman screams)	18	6	3
144	 What's in the tower?	18	6	3
145	 That's enough for one day.	18	6	3
146	 We'll visit again another time.	18	6	3
147	 I want to see where he's going.	18	6	3
148	 Time to go.	18	6	3
149	 (screaming continues)	18	6	3
150	 Father!	18	6	3
151	 (gasps)	18	6	3
152	 Why did you do that?	19	6	3
153	 Take me back there. I want to go back.	19	6	3
154	 No.	19	6	3
155	 He heard me.	19	6	3
156	 Maybe.	19	6	3
157	 Maybe he heard the wind.	19	6	3
158	 He heard me.	19	6	3
159	 The past is already written. The ink is dry.	19	6	3
160	 What's in that tower?	19	6	3
161	 I want to go back there.	19	6	3
162	 I've told you many times,	19	6	3
163	 stay too long where you don't belong and you will never return.	19	6	3
164	 Why do I want to return?	19	6	3
165	 So I can be a cripple again?	19	6	3
166	 So I can talk to an old man in a tree?	19	6	3
167	 You think I wanted to sit here for 1,000 years watching the world from a distance	19	6	3
168	 as the roots grew through me?	20	6	3
169	 So why did you?	20	6	3
170	 I was waiting for you.	20	6	3
171	 I don't want to be you.	20	6	3
172	 (laughs) I don't blame you.	20	6	3
173	 You won't be here forever.	20	6	3
174	 You won't be an old man in a tree.	20	6	3
175	 But before you leave, you must learn.	20	6	3
176	 Learn what?	20	6	3
177	 Everything.	20	6	3
178	 (chatter)	20	6	3
179	 I don't know how you stand it in all that leather.	24	6	3
180	 If we could have the room.	25	6	3
181	 You look lovely today, my dear. You really do.	25	6	3
182	 How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat.	25	6	3
183	 If you're going to torture me, just call them back and get on with it.	25	6	3
184	 I am not a torturer.	25	6	3
185	 Though it so often is what people deserve.	25	6	3
186	 And it does provide answers.	25	6	3
187	 But they're usually the wrong answers.	25	6	3
188	 My job is to find the right answers.	25	6	3
189	 Do you know how I do that?	25	6	3
190	 I do it by making people happy.	25	6	3
191	 I'd like to make you happy, Vala.	26	6	3
192	 That's your name, isn't it, Vala?	26	6	3
193	 (chuckles) That's all right.	26	6	3
194	 I know who you are and what you've done.	26	6	3
195	 You've done a lot.	26	6	3
196	 You've sacrificed your body for a cause, which is more than most people do.	26	6	3
197	 And you've helped the Sons of the Harpy murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons.	26	6	3
198	 The Unsullied and the Second Sons are foreign soldiers	26	6	3
199	 brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history.	26	6	3
200	 I understand.	26	6	3
201	 Well, that makes perfect sense from your perspective.	26	6	3
202	 I have a different perspective, of course.	26	6	3
203	 I think it's important that you try to see things from my perspective	26	6	3
204	 just as I will try to see them from yours.	26	6	3
205	 Because that is the only way that I can make you and Dom happy.	27	6	3
206	 That is how you pronounce it-- 'Dom'?	27	6	3
207	 I'm afraid I don't really speak the language.	27	6	3
208	 Such a handsome boy.	27	6	3
209	 Those big, brown eyes. Good luck keeping the ladies away.	27	6	3
210	 Yes, you're a true liberator, aren't you?	27	6	3
211	 You won't torture me, you'll just threaten my son.	27	6	3
212	 Children are blameless.	27	6	3
213	 I have never hurt them.	27	6	3
214	 Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you.	27	6	3
215	 But between us, dear, you did conspire to kill the queen's soldiers.	27	6	3
216	 We both know the penalty for that crime.	27	6	3
217	 How will poor Dom get on without his mother?	28	6	3
218	 And with his breathing problem.	28	6	3
219	 If I tell you anything, they'll kill me.	28	6	3
220	 So either you kill me or they do.	28	6	3
221	 Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem.	28	6	3
222	 There is a third option, though.	28	6	3
223	 A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos.	28	6	3
224	 I've already booked passage for a woman and her young son.	28	6	3
225	 I'll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again.	28	6	3
226	 Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it.	28	6	3
227	 Far too heavy for me.	28	6	3
228	 The boat sails at dawn.	28	6	3
229	 You need to decide now.	28	6	3
230	 A new life for you and Dom or...	28	6	3
231	 What should we do while we wait?	29	6	3
232	 To pass the time, what should we do?	29	6	3
233	 What should we talk about?	29	6	3
234	 You speak 19 languages.	29	6	3
235	 You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things.	29	6	3
236	 You two, you spend a great deal of time together.	29	6	3
237	 What would you be talking about if I weren't here?	29	6	3
238	 Patrol.	29	6	3
239	 When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied.	29	6	3
240	 What we see on patrol.	29	6	3
241	 Who we captured on patrol.	29	6	3
242	 That's good. That's very good.	29	6	3
243	 But that's a report.	29	6	3
244	 I was thinking more of a conversation.	29	6	3
245	 A wise man once said..	30	6	3
246	 the true history of the world is the history of great conversations in elegant rooms.	30	6	3
247	 Who said this?	30	6	3
248	 Me.	30	6	3
249	 Just now.	30	6	3
250	 All right, no conversations. Let's play a game.	30	6	3
251	 You don't play games, either one of you, ever?	30	6	3
252	 Games are for children.	30	6	3
253	 <b>Missandei</b>: My master Kraznys would sometimes make us play games.	30	6	3
254	 There, that's a start.	30	6	3
255	 Only the girls.	30	6	3
256	 No, no, no.	30	6	3
257	 Not that. Of course not that.	30	6	3
258	 Innocent games. Fun games.	30	6	3
259	 Drinking games.	30	6	3
260	 <b>Missandei</b>: We do not drink.	30	6	3
261	 Until you do.	30	6	3
262	 All right. No drinking...we can play without drinking.	31	6	3
263	 It's a wonderful game. I invented it.	31	6	3
264	 Here's how it works.	31	6	3
265	 I make a statement about your past.	31	6	3
266	 If I'm wrong, I drink.	31	6	3
267	 And if I'm right--	31	6	3
268	 maybe we can't play without drinking..	31	6	3
269	 (door opens)	31	6	3
270	 Oh, you took your time.	31	6	3
271	 Sorry.	31	6	3
272	 I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy.	31	6	3
273	 Some things you can't rush.	31	6	3
274	 You found out?	31	6	3
275	 The Good Masters of Astapor and the Wise Masters of Yunkai.	31	6	3
276	 With help from their friends in Volantis.	31	6	3
277	 <b>Tyrion</b>: You see?	31	6	3
278	 You don't even have to worry about the local rebellion.	31	6	3
279	 We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it.	31	6	3
280	 We conquered Astapor and Yunkai once.	31	6	3
281	 We will do it again and execute the Masters.	31	6	3
282	 If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Astapor and Yunkai,	31	6	3
283	 who will remain to defend the free people of Meereen?	32	6	3
284	 If we do not fight them, how can we stop them?	32	6	3
285	 We cannot.	32	6	3
286	 The Masters speak only one language.	32	6	3
287	 They spoke it to me for many years.	32	6	3
288	 I know it better than my mother tongue.	32	6	3
289	 If we want them to hear us, we must speak it back to them.	32	6	3
290	 May it be the last thing they ever hear.	32	6	3
291	 You may be right.	32	6	3
292	 <b>Grey worm</b>: So we will fight them?	32	6	3
293	 Possibly.	32	6	3
294	 Possibly?	32	6	3
295	 It's a conversation.	32	6	3
296	 Tell me, can your little birds get a message to the Good Masters of Astapor,	32	6	3
297	 the Wise Masters of Yunkai,	32	6	3
298	 and benevolent enslavers of Volantis?	32	6	3
299	 Of course. Men can be fickle, but birds I always trust.	32	6	3
300	 (children chatting quietly)	32	6	3
301	 Your eye looks much better, Arthur.	32	6	3
302	 How's your mother's jaw?	32	6	3
303	 Better.	33	6	3
304	 And your father?	33	6	3
305	 No one's seen him.	33	6	3
306	 And no one will.	33	6	3
307	 That worked out rather nicely.	33	6	3
308	 Will Lord Varys ever come back?	33	6	3
309	 I don't think so.	33	6	3
310	 Do you miss him?	33	6	3
311	 He was nice.	33	6	3
312	 He called us his little birds.	33	6	3
313	 He gave us sweets.	33	6	3
314	 It's funny you should mention that.	33	6	3
315	 Guess what I happened to find today.	33	6	3
316	 Candied plums from Dorne.	33	6	3
317	 (laughing)	33	6	3
318	 Now remember,	33	6	3
319	 if any of your friends like sweets or need help, they can always come to me.	33	6	3
320	 All I need in return	33	6	3
321	 are whispers.	33	6	3
322	 (door opens)	33	6	3
323	 <b>Qyburn</b>: No need to be afraid.	34	6	3
324	 This is Ser Gregor.	34	6	3
325	 He's friends with all my friends.	34	6	3
326	 Run along now.	34	6	3
327	 Varys's little birds?	34	6	3
328	 Your little birds now, Your Grace.	34	6	3
329	 What did you do to him exactly?	34	6	3
330	 I haven't been able to get a clear answer.	34	6	3
331	 Oh, a number of things.	34	6	3
332	 Does he understand what we're saying?	34	6	3
333	 I mean, to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place.	34	6	3
334	 He understands well enough.	34	6	3
335	 So tell him to march into the sept and crush the High Sparrow's head like a melon.	34	6	3
336	 The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militants surrounding him.	34	6	3
337	 Ser Gregor can't face them all.	34	6	3
338	 And he won't have to.	35	6	3
339	 He'll only have to face one.	35	6	3
340	 Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?	35	6	3
341	 Not yet.	35	6	3
342	 That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching.	35	6	3
343	 Don't stop at the city.	35	6	3
344	 I want little birds in Dorne,	35	6	3
345	 in Highgarden,	35	6	3
346	 in the North.	35	6	3
347	 If someone is planning on making our losses their gains, I want to hear it.	35	6	3
348	 If someone is laughing at the queen who walked naked through the streets covered in shit, I want to hear.	35	6	3
349	 I want to know who they are.	35	6	3
350	 I want to know where they are.	35	6	3
351	 <b>Pycelle</b>: As bad as Lord Varys was, Qyburn is worse.	35	6	3
352	 I told them all. I told them.	35	6	3
353	 He's arrogant, dangerous.	35	6	3
354	 You don't get thrown out of the Citadel without good reason.	35	6	3
355	 And no one listened to my advice.	36	6	3
356	 So here we are.	36	6	3
357	 And what he's done to Gregor Clegane is an abomination.	36	6	3
358	 We never sanctioned this experiment.	36	6	3
359	 I for one think it will be in our best interest to have the beast dest-	36	6	3
360	 (farts)	36	6	3
361	 Can I help you?	36	6	3
362	 Why are you here?	36	6	3
363	 My mother-	36	6	3
364	 I was invited, my dear,	36	6	3
365	 to help deal with several troublesome issues,	36	6	3
366	 such as the queen's imprisonment.	36	6	3
367	 Thank you for bringing it up.	36	6	3
368	 It's well past time we addressed the abuses I endured.	36	6	3
369	 Margaery is the queen.	36	6	3
370	 You are not the queen because you're not married to the king.	36	6	3
371	 I do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family.	36	6	3
372	 This is a small council meeting.	36	6	3
373	 You have no position on the small council.	37	6	3
374	 I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.	37	6	3
375	 The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard does have a position on the small council.	37	6	3
376	 Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?	37	6	3
377	 Well, um...	37	6	3
378	 I would say Ser Gerold Hightower had a seat on the Mad King's council.	37	6	3
379	 Of course, that was the Mad King.	37	6	3
380	 King Robert saw things differently.	37	6	3
381	 And King- (loud thud)	37	6	3
382	 What about Myrcella's death, Uncle?	37	6	3
383	 Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue?	37	6	3
384	 The same women who murdered Myrcella have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne.	37	6	3
385	 We've got a lot to discuss.	37	6	3
386	 All of us together.	37	6	3
387	 And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it.	37	6	3
388	 No, we cannot make you leave.	37	6	3
389	 And you cannot make us stay.	37	6	3
390	 Not unless you're gonna have that thing murder us all.	38	6	3
391	 (door opens)	38	6	3
392	 (armor rattling)	38	6	3
393	 (groans) Your Grace.	38	6	3
394	 My mother would like to see her daughter's final resting place.	38	6	3
395	 I'm sorry, Your Grace.	39	6	3
396	 That's not possible. Not yet.	39	6	3
397	 When will it be possible?	39	6	3
398	 When she's fully atoned for her sins.	39	6	3
399	 You cut off her hair	39	6	3
400	 and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city.	39	6	3
401	 That wasn't the full atonement?	39	6	3
402	 No.	39	6	3
403	 She must stand trial before seven septons	39	6	3
404	 so we can learn the true extent of her sins.	39	6	3
405	 I want you to let her see Myrcella's resting place.	39	6	3
406	 I am the king.	39	6	3
407	 You are.	39	6	3
408	 And what does that mean to you?	39	6	3
409	 It means a great deal to me.	39	6	3
410	 The Crown and the Faith are the twin pillars of the world.	39	6	3
411	 Do you know who told me that?	39	6	3
412	 Your mother.	39	6	3
413	 My mother who is unclean?	39	6	3
414	 My mother who still needs to atone after all you've put her through?	39	6	3
415	 How do you think the Mother Above first came to us?	40	6	3
416	 How did men and women first come to feel the Mother's presence,	40	6	3
417	 hmm?	40	6	3
418	 It was through their own mothers.	40	6	3
419	 There's a great deal of falsehood in Cersei. You know that.	40	6	3
420	 But when she speaks of you, the Mother's love outshines it all.	40	6	3
421	 Her love for you is more real than anything else in this world because it doesn't come from this world.	40	6	3
422	 But you know that.	40	6	3
423	 You've felt it.	41	6	3
424	 You've seen her when she talks to you.	41	6	3
425	 Yes.	41	6	3
426	 It's a great gift.	41	6	3
427	 One I never had.	41	6	3
428	 Envy.	41	6	3
429	 One more thing for me to atone for.	41	6	3
430	 Your Grace, do you-- may I?	41	6	3
431	 Do you mind?	41	6	3
432	 It's my knees.	41	6	3
433	 Of course.	41	6	3
434	 When your mother made her walk of atonement,	41	6	3
435	 she did it to get back to you.	41	6	3
436	 I still don't understand why you want to put her through any more than she's already endured.	41	6	3
437	 It's not what I want.	41	6	3
438	 It's what the gods want.	41	6	3
439	 They make their will known to us and it's up to us to either accept or reject it.	41	6	3
440	 Please.	42	6	3
441	 If we're to be just and good, then we accept it, all of us, even kings.	42	6	3
442	 A true leader avails himself of the wisest counsel he can.	42	6	3
443	 And no one is wiser than the gods.	42	6	3
444	 My grandfather once said something similar.	42	6	3
445	 Except for the part about the gods.	42	6	3
446	 The gods worked through him whether he knew it or not.	42	6	3
447	 As they work through your mother.	42	6	3
448	 There's so much good in all of us.	42	6	3
449	 The best we can do is to help each other bring it out.	42	6	3
450	 (gasps)	43	6	3
451	 (gasps)	43	6	3
452	 Who are you?	43	6	3
453	 No one.	43	6	3
454	 (grunts)	43	6	3
455	 <b>Waif</b>: Who were you before you came here?	43	6	3
456	 <b>Arya</b>: Arya Stark.	43	6	3
457	 (grunts)	43	6	3
458	  Tell me about Arya Stark's family.	43	6	3
459	 Her father was Eddard Stark.	43	6	3
460	 Her mother was Catelyn Stark.	43	6	3
461	 She had one sister,	43	6	3
462	 Sansa,	43	6	3
463	 and four brothers.	43	6	3
464	 (panting)	43	6	3
465	 Three brothers.	44	6	3
466	 Robb, Bran, Rickon.	44	6	3
467	 And a half-brother Jon.	44	6	3
468	 And where are they now?	44	6	3
469	 <b>Arya</b>: They may be dead for all a girl knows.	44	6	3
470	 (sniffs)	44	6	3
471	 (sniffs)	44	6	3
472	 Tell me about the Hound.	44	6	3
473	 <b>Arya</b>: Also dead.	44	6	3
474	 Arya Stark left him to die. He was on her list.	44	6	3
475	 He was not on her list anymore.	44	6	3
476	 She had taken him off it.	44	6	3
477	 Why?	45	6	3
478	 Didn't she want him dead any longer?	45	6	3
479	 <b>Arya</b>: She did and she did not.	45	6	3
480	 She sounds confused.	45	6	3
481	 Yes, she was.	45	6	3
482	 Who else was on Arya Stark's funny little list?	45	6	3
483	 (groans)	45	6	3
484	 <b>Arya</b>: Cersei Lannister.	45	6	3
485	 Gregor Clegane.	45	6	3
486	 Walder Frey.	45	6	3
487	 (rustling)	45	6	3
488	 <b>Waif</b>: That's a short list.	45	6	3
489	 (panting)	45	6	3
490	 That can't be everyone you want to kill.	45	6	3
491	 Are you sure you're not forgetting someone?	46	6	3
492	 Which name would you like a girl to speak?	46	6	3
493	 (shouts)	46	6	3
494	 <b>Jaqen</b>: If a girl tells me her name,	46	6	3
495	 I will give her eyes back.	46	6	3
496	 A girl has no name.	47	6	3
497	 Come.	47	6	3
498	 If a girl is truly no one, she has nothing to fear.	47	6	3
499	 Who are you?	48	6	3
500	 No one.	48	6	3
501	 (horse whinnies)	48	6	3
502	 The Umbers are a famously loyal house.	48	6	3
503	 Famously loyal to the Starks.	48	6	3
504	 And you, Lord Karstark.	48	6	3
505	 Your people share blood with the Starks, don't they?	48	6	3
506	 But here we are. Times change.	48	6	3
507	 When my father became Warden of the North,	49	6	3
508	 your house refused to pledge their banners.	49	6	3
509	 Your father was a cunt.	49	6	3
510	 My beloved father, the Warden-	49	6	3
511	 Your father was a cunt and that's why you killed him.	49	6	3
512	 I might have done the same to my father,	49	6	3
513	 if he hadn't have done me the favor of dying on his own.	49	6	3
514	 My father was poisoned by our enemies.	49	6	3
515	 Mmm.	49	6	3
516	 Why have you come to Winterfell, Lord Umber?	49	6	3
517	 The bastard Jon Snow led an army of wildlings past the Wall.	49	6	3
518	 We're farther north than any of you fuckers.	49	6	3
519	 Wildlings come down, we always have to fight them first.	49	6	3
520	 I like fighting wildlings. Been doing it all my life.	49	6	3
521	 But there are too many of them for us to beat back alone.	49	6	3
522	 So now you've come seeking help?	49	6	3
523	 We need to help each other.	49	6	3
524	 The colder it gets, the farther south those goat fuckers will roam.	49	6	3
525	 Won't take them long to get here.	50	6	3
526	 You think a horde of wildlings can take Winterfell?	50	6	3
527	 If they get Jon Snow leading them, maybe.	50	6	3
528	 He knows this place better than we ever will.	50	6	3
529	 Pledge your banners to House Bolton.	50	6	3
530	 Swear loyalty to me as Warden of the North	50	6	3
531	 and we will fight together to destroy the bastard and all his wildling friends.	50	6	3
532	 I'm not kissing your fucking hand.	50	6	3
533	 Traditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord.	50	6	3
534	 I'm not doing that either.	50	6	3
535	 Why would I trust a man who won't honor tradition?	50	6	3
536	 Your father honored tradition.	50	6	3
537	 Knelt for Robb Stark.	50	6	3
538	 Called him King of the North.	50	6	3
539	 Was Robb Stark right to trust your father?	50	6	3
540	 Then it appears we're at a bit of an impasse.	50	6	3
541	 fuck kneeling and fuck oaths.	50	6	3
542	 I've got a gift for you.	50	6	3
543	 A girl, I hope.	50	6	3
544	 I prefer redheads.	51	6	3
545	 A girl, aye.	51	6	3
546	 (laughing)	51	6	3
547	 A wild one.	51	6	3
548	 I like them wild.	51	6	3
549	 And the boy, nice and young.	51	6	3
550	 The way Karstark likes them.	51	6	3
551	 Who's this?	51	6	3
552	 Rickon Stark.	51	6	3
553	 How do I know that's Rickon Stark?	51	6	3
554	 Welcome home, Lord Stark.	52	6	3
555	 (pounding on door)	52	6	3
556	 It's time.	52	6	3
557	 If you have any last words, now is the time.	53	6	3
558	 You shouldn't be alive.	53	6	3
559	 It's not right.	53	6	3
560	 Neither was killing me.	53	6	3
561	 My mother's still living at White Harbor.	53	6	3
562	 Could you write her?	53	6	3
563	 Tell her I died fighting the wildlings.	53	6	3
564	 I had a choice, Lord Commander.	53	6	3
565	 Betray you	54	6	3
566	 or betray the Night's Watch.	54	6	3
567	 You brought an army of wildlings into our lands.	54	6	3
568	 An army of murderers and raiders.	54	6	3
569	 If I had to do it all over knowing where I'd end up,	54	6	3
570	 I pray I'd make the right choice again.	54	6	3
571	 I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser.	54	6	3
572	 I fought,	54	6	3
573	 I lost.	54	6	3
574	 Now I rest.	54	6	3
575	 But you,	54	6	3
576	 Lord Snow,	54	6	3
577	 you'll be fighting their battles forever.	54	6	3
578	 (choking, gasping)	55	6	3
579	 We should burn the bodies.	56	6	3
580	 You should.	56	6	3
581	 What do you want me to do with this?	57	6	3
582	 Wear it.	57	6	3
583	 Burn it.	57	6	3
584	 Whatever you want.	57	6	3
585	 You have Castle Black.	57	6	3
586	 My watch is ended.	57	6	3
587		0	6	3
0	 1 This march is a distraction.	0	3	3
1	 My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.	0	3	3
2	 - Are we riding to battle at Riverrun? - No.	0	3	3
3	 Then it's a distraction.	0	3	3
4	 - They're growing fast. - Not fast enough.	0	3	3
5	 I need an army.	0	3	3
6	 We'll be in Astapor by nightfall.	0	3	3
7	 Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.	0	3	3
8	 The greatest slave-soldiers in the world.	0	3	3
9	 - Who are you? - Thoros of Myr.	0	3	3
10	 - Who do you fight for? - The Brotherhood without Banners.	0	3	3
11	 The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside.	0	3	3
12	 We're trying to save it.	0	3	3
13	 - Your sister sent me. - Yara?	0	3	3
14	 I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.	0	3	3
15	 I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn,	0	3	3
16	 to ask your forgiveness.	0	3	3
17	 I am Barristan Selmy, Kingsguard to your father.	0	3	3
18	 I will not fail you again.	0	3	3
19	 - What's wrong with him? - He's a warg.	0	3	3
20	 He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes.	0	3	3
21	 He's scouting for us.	0	3	3
22	 Orell, where were you this time?	0	3	3
23	 The Fist of the First Men.	1	3	3
24	 - What did you see? - Dead crows.	1	3	3
25	 Get up, Tarly. I forbid you to die.	1	3	3
26	 You're responsible for him.	1	3	3
27	 Make sure he gets back alive.	1	3	3
28	 So good to see you again, Clegane.	1	3	3
29	 Girl.	1	3	3
30	 What in seven hells	1	3	3
31	 are you doing with the Stark bitch?	1	3	3
32	 Get up.	1	3	3
33	 Ah!	1	3	3
34	 Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.	1	3	3
35	 Enough to buy me a new head?	1	3	3
36		3	3	3
37	 If I may, nephew,	6	3	3
38	 I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants	6	3	3
39	 at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing--	6	3	3
40	 Why don't you shut your mouth about that damned mill?	6	3	3
41	" And don't call him ""nephew."" He is your king."	6	3	3
42	 Robb knows I meant him no disr--	6	3	3
43	 You're lucky I'm not your king.	6	3	3
44	 I wouldn't let you wave your blunders around	6	3	3
45	 like a victory flag.	6	3	3
46	 My blunder sent Tywin's mad dog	6	3	3
47	 scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs.	6	3	3
48	 I think King Robb understands we're not gonna win this war	6	3	3
49	 if he's the only one winning any battles.	6	3	3
50	 No, there's glory enough to go around.	6	3	3
51	 It's not about glory.	6	3	3
52	 Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.	6	3	3
53	 I seized an opportunity.	6	3	3
54	 What value was the mill?	6	3	3
55	 The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it.	6	3	3
56	 Is he there now?	6	3	3
57	 Of course not. We took the fight to him.	7	3	3
58	 He could not withstand us.	7	3	3
59	 I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west,	7	3	3
60	 into our country where we could surround him and kill him.	7	3	3
61	 I wanted him to chase us,	7	3	3
62	 which he would have done because he is a mad dog	7	3	3
63	 without a strategic thought in his head.	7	3	3
64	 I could have that head on a spike by now.	7	3	3
65	 Instead, I have a mill.	7	3	3
66	 We took hostages.	7	3	3
67	 Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister.	7	3	3
68	 Willem and Martyn Lannister are 14 years old.	7	3	3
69	 Martyn is 15, I believe.	7	3	3
70	 Tywin Lannister has my sisters.	7	3	3
71	 Have I sued for peace?	7	3	3
72	 No.	7	3	3
73	 Do you think he'll sue for peace	7	3	3
74	 because we have his father's	7	3	3
75	 brother's great-grandsons?	8	3	3
76	 No.	8	3	3
77	 How many men did you lose?	8	3	3
78	 208.	8	3	3
79	 But for every man we lost, the Lannisters--	8	3	3
80	 We need our men more than Tywin needs his!	8	3	3
81	 I'm sorry.	8	3	3
82	 - I didn't know. - You would have.	8	3	3
83	 Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient.	8	3	3
84	 We seem to be running short of patience here.	8	3	3
85	 You know who isn't?	8	3	3
86	 Tywin Lannister.	8	3	3
87	 Intimate. Lovely table.	10	3	3
88	 Better chairs than the old small council chamber.	10	3	3
89	 Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it.	10	3	3
90	 What news of Jaime?	11	3	3
91	 20,000 unwashed Northerners	11	3	3
92	 have known about his escape for weeks.	11	3	3
93	 Collectively, you control more spies and informants	11	3	3
94	 than the rest of the world combined.	11	3	3
95	 Do you mean to tell me that none of you	11	3	3
96	 has any notion of where he is?	11	3	3
97	 - We are trying, my lord. - Try harder.	11	3	3
98	 What do we have, then?	11	3	3
99	 Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun	11	3	3
100	 for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully.	11	3	3
101	 In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal,	11	3	3
102	 which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal,	11	3	3
103	 - in practice if not in name. - Well, let him have it.	11	3	3
104	 The name suits our purposes	11	3	3
105	 far more than that useless pile of rubble.	11	3	3
106	 The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.	11	3	3
107	 For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord.	12	3	3
108	 Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children.	12	3	3
109	 She has always been...	12	3	3
110	 positively predisposed toward me.	12	3	3
111	 A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish	12	3	3
112	 acting Lord of the Vale.	12	3	3
113	 Titles do seem to breed titles.	12	3	3
114	 You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible	12	3	3
115	 and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold.	12	3	3
116	 Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list	12	3	3
117	 of people who have taken up arms against him.	12	3	3
118	 Far be it from me to hinder true love,	12	3	3
119	 but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems.	12	3	3
120	 The royal wedding may end up	12	3	3
121	 being the most expensive event in living memory.	12	3	3
122	 Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead.	12	3	3
123	 Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended.	12	3	3
124	 Fully agreed.	12	3	3
125	 Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.	12	3	3
126	 Master of Coin?	12	3	3
127	 It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.	13	3	3
128	 I'm quite good at spending money,	13	3	3
129	 but a lifetime of outrageous wealth	13	3	3
130	 hasn't taught me much about managing it.	13	3	3
131	 I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.	13	3	3
132	 Hear, hear.	13	3	3
133	  He lifted her high in the air 	13	3	3
134	  He sniffed and roared and smelled her there 	13	3	3
135	  She kicked and wailed, a maid so fair 	13	3	3
136	  But he licked the honey from her hair 	13	3	3
137	  From there to here, from here to there 	13	3	3
138	  All black and brown and covered with hair 	13	3	3
139	  He smelled that girl in the summer air 	13	3	3
140	  The bear, the bear and the maiden fair... 	13	3	3
141	 I hope you're pleased.	13	3	3
142	 If you had armed me, they never would have taken us.	13	3	3
143	 You were armed when we were taken.	13	3	3
144	 I was in chains if you recall.	13	3	3
145	 Our little match would have ended quite quick	13	3	3
146	 if my hands weren't bound.	13	3	3
147	" All my life I've been hearing, ""Jaime Lannister,"	13	3	3
148	" what a brilliant swordsman."""	13	3	3
149	 You were slower than I expected.	14	3	3
150	 And more predictable.	14	3	3
151	 I've been sitting in a muddy pen	14	3	3
152	 wrapped in chains for the past year.	14	3	3
153	 And I'm a woman. I was still beating you.	14	3	3
154	 You were not beating me.	14	3	3
155	 Maybe you were as good as people said...	14	3	3
156	 once.	14	3	3
157	 Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name.	14	3	3
158	 When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped.	14	3	3
159	 More than once.	14	3	3
160	 None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman.	14	3	3
161	 You'd be wise not to resist.	14	3	3
162	 - Would I? - They'll knock your teeth out.	14	3	3
163	 You think I care about my teeth?	14	3	3
164	 No, I don't think you care about your teeth.	14	3	3
165	 If you fight them, they will kill you.	14	3	3
166	 Do you understand?	14	3	3
167	 I'm the prisoner of value, not you.	14	3	3
168	 Let them have what they want. What does it matter?	14	3	3
169	 - What does it matter? - Close your eyes.	14	3	3
170	 Pretend they're Renly.	15	3	3
171	 If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist?	15	3	3
172	 You'd let them do what they wanted?	15	3	3
173	 If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me.	15	3	3
174	 But I'm not, thank the gods.	15	3	3
175	 If I had a proper forge, I could make it good as new.	15	3	3
176	 Doesn't have to look pretty.	15	3	3
177	 It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart.	15	3	3
178	 Why are you helping him?	15	3	3
179	 He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend?	15	3	3
180	 You're not our prisoner, little lady.	15	3	3
181	 - What am I? - Our guest.	15	3	3
182	 No one's put any chains on you.	15	3	3
183	 So I can walk away, then?	15	3	3
184	 These woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter.	15	3	3
185	 You're lucky we found you.	15	3	3
186	 You think you're good with that bow, you little twat?	15	3	3
187	 Better than anyone you've ever met.	15	3	3
188	 A coward's weapon.	15	3	3
189	 I like to fight up close.	15	3	3
190	 I like to see a man's face when I put the steel in him.	16	3	3
191	 Why? So you can kiss him?	16	3	3
192	 You remember the last time you were here?	16	3	3
193	 Looks like every other shit inn on the road.	16	3	3
194	 Now, apologies, but you're one ugly fucker	16	3	3
195	 and I'd rather not see you no more.	16	3	3
196	 Watch your head.	16	3	3
197	 Off we go.	16	3	3
198	 Walk up!	16	3	3
199	 What are you doing? We're about to leave.	16	3	3
200	 I'm staying.	16	3	3
201	 You're what?	16	3	3
202	 I baked some brown bread for the innkeep	16	3	3
203	 and she said she never had better.	16	3	3
204	 Told Thoros she's keeping me as a payment	16	3	3
205	 for all the free meals she's given him.	16	3	3
206	 Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood wants.	16	3	3
207	 My brother ain't no king.	16	3	3
208	 I'm not a Stark of Winterhell.	16	3	3
209	 Winterfell.	17	3	3
210	 - You sure? - I'm sure.	17	3	3
211	 Well, I made you something.	17	3	3
212	 What is it?	17	3	3
213	 It's a wolf.	17	3	3
214	 Yes, it is.	17	3	3
215	 That's the tail?	17	3	3
216	 Yeah.	17	3	3
217	 Well, be safe.	17	3	3
218	 Yeah, you, too.	17	3	3
219	 Don't get stabbed.	17	3	3
220	 You don't...	17	3	3
221	 burn your fingers.	17	3	3
222	 Good-bye, Hot Pie.	17	3	3
223	 Good-bye, Arry.	18	3	3
224	 Up you go, little lady.	18	3	3
225	 Hey, Hot Pie.	18	3	3
226	 It's really good.	18	3	3
227	 A person could almost be forgiven	18	3	3
228	 for forgetting we're at war.	18	3	3
229	 It often comforts me to think that even in war's darkest days,	18	3	3
230	 in most places in the world	18	3	3
231	 absolutely nothing is happening.	18	3	3
232	 I've missed you, Uncle.	19	3	3
233	 Father missed you, too,	19	3	3
234	 from the day you left.	19	3	3
235	 Maybe he never said it in so many words--	19	3	3
236	 Maybe?	19	3	3
237	 Your father was a stubborn old ox.	19	3	3
238	 I was surprised when he died.	19	3	3
239	 Didn't think death had the patience.	19	3	3
240	 I'm glad you were with him.	19	3	3
241	 I wish to the gods I had been.	19	3	3
242	 Did you make peace in the end?	19	3	3
243	 After 30 years of fighting,	19	3	3
244	 I don't think he remembered what started it.	19	3	3
245	 He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish.	19	3	3
246	 He said it was an old joke	19	3	3
247	 and it was never funny to begin with.	19	3	3
248	 I told him people had been calling me Blackfish	19	3	3
249	 for so long, they don't remember my real name.	19	3	3
250	 Every time he would leave for the capital	20	3	3
251	 or fight in a campaign,	20	3	3
252	 I'd see him off.	20	3	3
253	" ""Wait for me, little Cat,"" he'd say."	20	3	3
254	" ""Wait for me"	20	3	3
255	" and I'll come back to you."""	20	3	3
256	 And I would sit at this window	20	3	3
257	 every day when the sun came up, waiting.	20	3	3
258	 I wonder	20	3	3
259	 how many times did Bran or Rickon	20	3	3
260	 stare across the moors of Winterfell	20	3	3
261	 waiting for me to return.	20	3	3
262	 I will never see them again.	20	3	3
263	 You mustn't think it.	20	3	3
264	 We don't know the truth.	20	3	3
265	 They could be in hiding.	20	3	3
266	 Robb believes they're alive.	20	3	3
267	 And he must go on believing.	21	3	3
268	 He's got to remain strong if he's to prevail.	21	3	3
269	 And you must remain strong for him.	21	3	3
270	 You're Robb Stark's wife.	21	3	3
271	 Hold still.	21	3	3
272	 Is it true what they say about him?	21	3	3
273	 I don't know. What do they say about him?	21	3	3
274	 That he can turn into a wolf at night.	21	3	3
275	 True.	21	3	3
276	 And he eats the flesh of his enemies.	21	3	3
277	 True.	21	3	3
278	 You're a Lannister, aren't you?	21	3	3
279	 Martyn Lannister.	21	3	3
280	 Martyn Lannister.	21	3	3
281	 You've nothing to fear.	21	3	3
282	 My husband doesn't eat children.	21	3	3
283	 Unless it's a full moon.	22	3	3
284	 It's not a full moon tonight, is it?	22	3	3
285	 See?	22	3	3
286	 Nothing to fear.	22	3	3
287	 Always the artists.	22	3	3
288	 It's only horses.	22	3	3
289	 No men.	23	3	3
290	 You said there was dead crows.	23	3	3
291	 There was.	23	3	3
292	 How many men were here?	23	3	3
293	 About 300.	23	3	3
294	 And you know what those men are now?	23	3	3
295	 We're all the same to them-- meat for their army.	23	3	3
296	 Do you think anyone got away?	23	3	3
297	 It's not impossible.	23	3	3
298	 You don't go far betting against Mormont.	23	3	3
299	 But dead or alive,	23	3	3
300	 he took a big gamble coming north.	23	3	3
301	 And he lost.	23	3	3
302	 His best fighting men are dead.	23	3	3
303	 And whether he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch	23	3	3
304	 or a blue-eyed corpse,	23	3	3
305	 he's a long way from home.	23	3	3
306	 Tormund.	23	3	3
307	 Climb the Wall.	23	3	3
308	 Take Orell and 20 good men.	23	3	3
309	 And take this one.	24	3	3
310	 He knows Castle Black's defenses better than any of us.	24	3	3
311	 And if he's useful, good. If not...	24	3	3
312	 throw him off the Wall.	24	3	3
313	 See if crows can fly.	24	3	3
314	 We're finally going to war, old friend?	24	3	3
315	 Hide near Castle Black.	24	3	3
316	 When I give the signal, hit them in the night.	24	3	3
317	 They've got a big old wall to hide behind,	24	3	3
318	 but it only guards one side.	24	3	3
319	 - We'll meet again. - Aye.	24	3	3
320	 - If you do your job. - Ah.	24	3	3
321	 How will we see your signal?	24	3	3
322	 Send your eagle above the Wall every night.	24	3	3
323	 When it's time, I'm going to light the biggest fire	24	3	3
324	 the North has ever seen.	24	3	3
325	 Ghost?	25	3	3
326	 What have we here? Frozen crows?	25	3	3
327	 We've come a long way.	25	3	3
328	 Smaller flock than you went north with.	25	3	3
329	 We can talk inside.	25	3	3
330	 Oh, can we?	25	3	3
331	 They need some water.	26	3	3
332	 Tether it and I'll be inside.	26	3	3
333	 Keep your eyes where they belong.	26	3	3
334	 They're not for you.	26	3	3
335	 Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us.	26	3	3
336	 Aye, pig's got value to me.	26	3	3
337	 You should all be kissing my feet for letting you in.	26	3	3
338	 I'd have turned you all away if I wasn't a godly man.	26	3	3
339	 You are a godly man?	26	3	3
340	 I am. I got no fear of what's out there.	26	3	3
341	 When the white cold comes,	27	3	3
342	 your swords and cloaks and bloody fires won't help you.	27	3	3
343	 The only ones left will be those who are right with the gods.	27	3	3
344	 The real gods.	27	3	3
345	 Go tell her she can bite down on a rag	27	3	3
346	 or she can bite down on my fist.	27	3	3
347	 Women.	27	3	3
348	 That sow right there gave birth	27	3	3
349	 to a litter of eight.	27	3	3
350	 Barely a grunt.	27	3	3
351	 And she's almost as fat as this one here.	27	3	3
352	 Now why don't you dine on him?	27	3	3
353	 Carve off what you need as you go.	27	3	3
354	 Well, look at him. He's a walking feast.	27	3	3
355	 Here we are.	28	3	3
356	 Sharpen these for me, would ya?	28	3	3
357	 I see the head. Push.	28	3	3
358	 That's it.	28	3	3
359	 You're nearly there.	28	3	3
360	 One more push should do it.	28	3	3
361	 What is it? What is it?	29	3	3
362	 Keep quiet.	29	3	3
363	 If you can't ride, we don't stand a chance.	30	3	3
364	 I can ride.	30	3	3
365	 You're sure?	30	3	3
366	 Ride east. Follow the rising sun.	30	3	3
367	 Your sister's waiting for you.	30	3	3
368	 I'll make you a Lord of the Iron Islands for this.	30	3	3
369	 We're not in the Iron Islands.	30	3	3
370	 - Go. - Come on.	30	3	3
371	 Come on. Come on.	30	3	3
372	 Come on. Come on.	30	3	3
373	 Come on back.	31	3	3
374	 You refuse to tell me where you're going?	31	3	3
375	 I don't know yet. The fires will show me.	31	3	3
376	 - How long will you be gone? - I don't know.	31	3	3
377	 You're abandoning me.	31	3	3
378	 I will never abandon you.	31	3	3
379	 You are the Son of Fire.	31	3	3
380	 - I am sworn to serve you. - Then serve me.	31	3	3
381	 When I return, you will understand.	31	3	3
382	 My enemies think they've destroyed me.	31	3	3
383	 They're laughing at me	31	3	3
384	 the way Renly laughed at me.	31	3	3
385	 I want Joffrey dead.	31	3	3
386	 I want Robb Stark dead.	31	3	3
387	 Make me another son.	31	3	3
388	 I cannot.	31	3	3
389	 Why?	31	3	3
390	 You don't have the strength. It would kill you.	32	3	3
391	 I'm not so easily killed. Men have been trying for years.	32	3	3
392	 I want you.	32	3	3
393	 Your fires burn low, my king.	32	3	3
394	 There is another way. A better way.	32	3	3
395	 You told me your magic requires a king's blood.	32	3	3
396	 - Yes. - I'm the one true king.	32	3	3
397	 You are.	32	3	3
398	 But there are others with your blood in their veins.	32	3	3
399	 You will sit on the Iron Throne,	32	3	3
400	 but first there must be sacrifices.	32	3	3
401	 The Lord of Light demands it.	32	3	3
402	 The Walk of Punishment is a warning, Your Grace.	33	3	3
403	 - To whom? - To any slave who contemplates doing	33	3	3
404	 whatever these slaves did.	33	3	3
405	 Give me your water.	33	3	3
406	 Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death.	33	3	3
407	 Here, drink.	33	3	3
408	 Leave this place, Your Grace.	33	3	3
409	 Leave tonight, I beg you.	33	3	3
410	 And what is she to do for soldiers?	33	3	3
411	 We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.	33	3	3
412	" Is it ""we"" already, Ser Barristan?"	33	3	3
413	 If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it.	33	3	3
414	 That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done.	34	3	3
415	 The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents.	34	3	3
416	 How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan?	34	3	3
417	 - Three. - Have you ever seen a war	34	3	3
418	 where innocents didn't die by the thousands?	34	3	3
419	 I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi.	34	3	3
420	 You know what I saw? Butchery.	34	3	3
421	 Babies, children, old men.	34	3	3
422	 More women raped than you can count.	34	3	3
423	 There's a beast in every man	34	3	3
424	 and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand.	34	3	3
425	 But the Unsullied are not men.	34	3	3
426	 They do not rape.	34	3	3
427	 They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so.	34	3	3
428	 If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead.	34	3	3
429	 Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?	34	3	3
430	 When your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident,	34	3	3
431	 men died for him because they believed in him,	34	3	3
432	 because they loved him,	35	3	3
433	 not because they'd been bought at a slaver's auction.	35	3	3
434	 I fought beside the last dragon on that day, Your Grace.	35	3	3
435	 I bled beside him.	35	3	3
436	 Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly,	35	3	3
437	 and Rhaegar died.	35	3	3
438	 Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?	35	3	3
439	 I did, Your Grace. Finest man I ever met.	35	3	3
440	 I wish I had known him.	35	3	3
441	 But he was not the last dragon.	35	3	3
442	 All?	35	3	3
443	 Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace?	35	3	3
444	 They did not. I want to buy them all.	35	3	3
445	 _	35	3	3
446	 _	35	3	3
447	 _	35	3	3
448	 _	36	3	3
449	 There are 8,000 Unsullied in Astapor.	36	3	3
450	 Is this what you mean by all?	36	3	3
451	 Yes. 8,000.	36	3	3
452	 And the ones still in training as well.	36	3	3
453	 _	36	3	3
454	 _	36	3	3
455	 Master Greizhen says they cannot sell half-trained boys.	36	3	3
456	 If they fail on the battlefield,	36	3	3
457	 they will bring shame upon all of Astapor.	36	3	3
458	 I will have them all or take none.	36	3	3
459	 Many will fall in battle.	36	3	3
460	 I'll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop.	36	3	3
461	 _	36	3	3
462	 Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.	36	3	3
463	 _	36	3	3
464	 Your ship will buy you 100 Unsullied.	36	3	3
465	 Because Master Kraznys is generous.	37	3	3
466	 The gold you have left is worth 10.	37	3	3
467	 But good Master Kraznys will give you 20.	37	3	3
468	 The Dothraki you have with you--	37	3	3
469	 _	37	3	3
470	 The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed,	37	3	3
471	 but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied	37	3	3
472	 for all of them.	37	3	3
473	 _	37	3	3
474	 Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay	37	3	3
475	 for the remaining 7,877 Unsullied.	37	3	3
476	 I have dragons. I'll give you one.	37	3	3
477	 You will win the throne with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace.	38	3	3
478	 Khaleesi, please.	38	3	3
479	 Three dragons.	38	3	3
480	 - One. - Two.	38	3	3
481	 One.	38	3	3
482	 They want the biggest one.	38	3	3
483	 - Done. - Done.	38	3	3
484	 I'll take you as well, now.	38	3	3
485	 You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me.	38	3	3
486	 A token of a bargain well struck.	38	3	3
487	 _	38	3	3
488	 _	38	3	3
489	 Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army.	39	3	3
490	 Aegon Targaryen proved that.	39	3	3
491	 You're both here to advise me.	39	3	3
492	 I value your advice, but if you ever question me	39	3	3
493	 in front of strangers again,	39	3	3
494	 you'll be advising someone else.	39	3	3
495	 Is that understood?	39	3	3
496	 Do you have a name?	39	3	3
497	 This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace.	39	3	3
498	 Do you have a family? A mother and a father	39	3	3
499	 you'd return to if you had the choice?	39	3	3
500	 No, Your Grace. No family living.	39	3	3
501	 You belong to me now. It is your duty to tell me the truth.	39	3	3
502	 Yes, Your Grace. Lying is a great offense.	39	3	3
503	 Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less.	39	3	3
504	 I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment.	39	3	3
505	" Do you know what he said to me? ""Let me die."""	39	3	3
506	 There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace.	39	3	3
507	 Is it true what Master Kraznys told me	40	3	3
508	 about the Unsullied? About their obedience?	40	3	3
509	 All questions have been taken from them.	40	3	3
510	 They obey, that is all.	40	3	3
511	 Once they are yours, they are yours.	40	3	3
512	 They will fall on their swords if you command it.	40	3	3
513	 And what about you? You know that I'm taking you to war.	40	3	3
514	 You may go hungry. You may fall sick.	40	3	3
515	 You may be killed.	40	3	3
516	 Valar morghulis.	40	3	3
517	 Yes, all men must die.	40	3	3
518	 But we are not men.	40	3	3
519	 A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers.	40	3	3
520	 I'm surprised you're surprised.	40	3	3
521	 This is the safest place in the city.	40	3	3
522	 Not for bastards.	40	3	3
523	 That's all of them, my lord.	41	3	3
524	 Thank you, my dear. Pod.	41	3	3
525	 Pod. Take them outside.	41	3	3
526	 - I'll be there in a moment. - Yes, my lord.	41	3	3
527	 I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.	41	3	3
528	 Only my life.	41	3	3
529	 Not all that significant, I'm afraid.	41	3	3
530	 You should have him knighted.	41	3	3
531	 If only the Master of Coin had such power.	41	3	3
532	 If only.	41	3	3
533	 I owe you a significant debt.	41	3	3
534	 Our redheaded friend.	41	3	3
535	 You secured her release when the queen detained her.	41	3	3
536	 Oh, that.	41	3	3
537	 Of course. A simple misunderstanding.	41	3	3
538	 Apparently, Her Grace believed	41	3	3
539	 that you two had some sort of special relationship.	42	3	3
540	 We don't. I did fuck her once.	42	3	3
541	 - I know. - But we don't.	42	3	3
542	 I know.	42	3	3
543	 But how would the queen get that idea?	42	3	3
544	 Why don't you ask her?	42	3	3
545	 Any advice for me on my new position?	42	3	3
546	 Keep a low profile.	42	3	3
547	 If I had a gold dragon	42	3	3
548	 for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are.	42	3	3
549	 Well, you are richer than I am.	42	3	3
550	 Good point.	42	3	3
551	 They're only numbers. Numbers on paper.	42	3	3
552	 Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave.	42	3	3
553	 Trivial even.	42	3	3
554	 You want a real challenge?	42	3	3
555	 Try whores.	42	3	3
556	 I've tried quite a few.	42	3	3
557	 Well, lots of work to do.	42	3	3
558	 Enjoy the Eyrie.	42	3	3
559	 Come on, I'm here later.	43	3	3
560	 Come on.	43	3	3
561	 Tonight, then.	43	3	3
562	 Looks like dull reading.	43	3	3
563	 You think all reading is dull reading.	43	3	3
564	 It's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know.	43	3	3
565	 The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages.	43	3	3
566	 Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers	43	3	3
567	 to hide what he's really up to.	43	3	3
568	 Unless he made it all up, yes.	43	3	3
569	 - Podrick, do keep up. - Yes, my lord.	43	3	3
570	 - Podrick. - Yes, my lord?	43	3	3
571	 After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn,	43	3	3
572	 I finally found a suitable reward	43	3	3
573	 for the services you've provided over and above	43	3	3
574	 what might be considered reasonable.	43	3	3
575	 Tell me, Pod,	43	3	3
576	 have you ever been with a woman?	43	3	3
577	 - No, my lord. - Wonderful.	43	3	3
578	 Genna specializes in first-timers.	43	3	3
579	 She's not bad with second-timers, either.	44	3	3
580	 Uh, my lord...	44	3	3
581	 A fair enough repayment for putting your spear	44	3	3
582	 through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say?	44	3	3
583	 Now, as it happens,	44	3	3
584	 Marei...	44	3	3
585	 is quite the spear handler herself.	44	3	3
586	 She's here to thank you for staying by my side	44	3	3
587	 as the battle raged all around me.	44	3	3
588	 He's handsome.	44	3	3
589	 You didn't tell me he was handsome.	44	3	3
590	 Kayla is famous from here to Volantis	44	3	3
591	 in certain circles.	44	3	3
592	 One of four women in the world	44	3	3
593	 who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.	44	3	3
594	 My lord, I don't even...	44	3	3
595	 She's here to thank you	44	3	3
596	 for being a thoroughly respectful fellow	44	3	3
597	" who's never once failed to address me as ""my lord."""	44	3	3
598	 Be back in time for my supper.	45	3	3
599	 Pace yourself, lad.	45	3	3
600	 For years I've heard that Littlefinger	45	3	3
601	 is a magician.	45	3	3
602	 Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together	45	3	3
603	 and, poof, mountains of gold.	45	3	3
604	 Let me guess. He's not a magician.	45	3	3
605	 No.	45	3	3
606	 - He's stealing it? - Worse, he's borrowing it.	45	3	3
607	 What's wrong with that?	45	3	3
608	 We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it.	45	3	3
609	 The crown owes millions to my father.	45	3	3
610	 Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne,	45	3	3
611	 I imagine he'll forgive that debt.	45	3	3
612	 Forgive a debt, my father?	45	3	3
613	 For a man of the world, you're strangely naive.	45	3	3
614	 I've never borrowed money before.	45	3	3
615	 I'm not clear on the rules.	45	3	3
616	 Well...	46	3	3
617	 Ahem!	46	3	3
618	 The basic principle is	46	3	3
619	 I lend you money,	46	3	3
620	 and after an agreed upon period of time,	46	3	3
621	 you return it with interest.	46	3	3
622	 And what if I don't?	46	3	3
623	 Well, you have to.	46	3	3
624	 But what if I don't?	46	3	3
625	 This is why I don't lend you money.	46	3	3
626	 Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about.	46	3	3
627	 It's the Iron Bank of Braavos.	46	3	3
628	 We owe them tens of millions.	46	3	3
629	 If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies.	46	3	3
630	 One way or another, they always get their gold back.	46	3	3
631	 Ah, the return of the conquering hero.	46	3	3
632	 Does he have a little jaunt in his step?	46	3	3
633	 The lad's practically skipping.	46	3	3
634	 You were gone a long time.	46	3	3
635	 I trust you got your money's worth.	46	3	3
636	 Or should I say my money's worth?	46	3	3
637	 Oh, it was a gift, Podrick.	47	3	3
638	 This is more than I give you in a year.	47	3	3
639	 He's a squire. You don't pay him.	47	3	3
640	 Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year.	47	3	3
641	 They wouldn't take it, my lord.	47	3	3
642	 Maybe they're trying to curry some favor	47	3	3
643	 with the new Master of Coin.	47	3	3
644	 Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold?	47	3	3
645	 They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.	47	3	3
646	 What did you tell them?	47	3	3
647	 I didn't tell them anything.	47	3	3
648	 - What did you do to them? - Lots of things.	47	3	3
649	 And they seemed to like these things?	47	3	3
650	 Yes, my lord.	47	3	3
651	 Of course they seemed to like it.	47	3	3
652	 They're paid to seem to like it.	47	3	3
653	 Only they weren't paid.	47	3	3
654	 What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much,	47	3	3
655	 they gave him the time for free?	47	3	3
656	 Is that what you're telling us?	47	3	3
657	 Sit down, Podrick.	47	3	3
658	 We're going to need details.	48	3	3
659	 Copious details.	48	3	3
660	 Come on! Come on!	48	3	3
661	 Come on!	48	3	3
662	 Come on.	49	3	3
663	 Ha! Ha!	49	3	3
664	 You know how we deal with runaways here, do you?	50	3	3
665	 Take off his pants.	50	3	3
666	 No! No!	50	3	3
667	 No, no, no!	50	3	3
668	 I'm gonna fuck you into the dirt.	50	3	3
669	 No, please! No, no, no!	50	3	3
670	 No, don't!	51	3	3
671	 No, please!	51	3	3
672	 No! No!	51	3	3
673	 You little bastard.	51	3	3
674	 Come, my lord.	51	3	3
675	 You're a long way from home and winter is coming.	52	3	3
676	 I'll take the big bitch first.	52	3	3
677	 When she's good and wet, you lot can finish her off.	52	3	3
678	 My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth.	52	3	3
679	 Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me	52	3	3
680	 to deliver Ser Jaime to King's Landing.	52	3	3
681	 Catelyn Stark's a treasonous cunt.	52	3	3
682	 Orders were to take the Kingslayer alive.	52	3	3
683	 Nobody said shit about you.	52	3	3
684	 You're only making it worse.	53	3	3
685	 Take her over there where it's dark.	53	3	3
686	 I'd like a little privacy.	53	3	3
687	 Come on!	53	3	3
688	 You know who she is, don't you?	53	3	3
689	 A big dumb bitch from who cares where.	53	3	3
690	 Never been with a woman that big.	53	3	3
691	 She's Brienne of Tarth.	53	3	3
692	 Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth.	53	3	3
693	 Heard of Tarth?	53	3	3
694	 I'm gonna cut your throat!	53	3	3
695	 They call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why?	53	3	3
696	 Every sapphire in Westeros	53	3	3
697	 was mined on Tarth.	54	3	3
698	 Sapphires are gemstones.	54	3	3
699	 - The blue ones. - I know what they are.	54	3	3
700	 Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight	54	3	3
701	 in sapphires if she's returned to him.	54	3	3
702	 But only if she's alive,	54	3	3
703	 her honor unbesmirched.	54	3	3
704	 Bring her back here.	54	3	3
705	 Yes, my lord.	54	3	3
706	 - Get up. - Come on.	54	3	3
707	 Come on, on your feet.	54	3	3
708	 Unbesmirched.	54	3	3
709	 Not defiled.	54	3	3
710	 Fancy word for a fancy man.	54	3	3
711	 I hated to read as a child,	54	3	3
712	 but my father forced me to study the books every morning	54	3	3
713	 before I could practice with sword or horse.	55	3	3
714	 Two hours every day holed up in the maester's chambers.	55	3	3
715	 I learned a lot of fancy words.	55	3	3
716	 I bet you did.	55	3	3
717	 Your father,	55	3	3
718	 he'd pay your weight in gold to get you back?	55	3	3
719	 You'll be a rich man till the end of your days.	55	3	3
720	 And your sons will be rich men	55	3	3
721	 and their sons after them.	55	3	3
722	 Lands, titles--	55	3	3
723	 you'll have them all.	55	3	3
724	 The North can't win this war.	55	3	3
725	 You're a smart man. You understand that.	55	3	3
726	 We have the numbers. We have the gold.	55	3	3
727	 Aye, you have both.	55	3	3
728	 Fighting bravely for a losing cause	55	3	3
729	 is admirable.	56	3	3
730	 Fighting for a winning cause	56	3	3
731	 is far more rewarding.	56	3	3
732	 Hard to argue with that.	56	3	3
733	 Now that we're speaking together man to man,	56	3	3
734	 I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree.	56	3	3
735	 I'm not asking to be freed from my constraints,	56	3	3
736	 but if I could sleep lying down,	56	3	3
737	 my back would thank you for it.	56	3	3
738	 I'm not as young	56	3	3
739	 and resilient as I was once.	56	3	3
740	 None of us are.	56	3	3
741	 Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree.	56	3	3
742	 Come on, men.	56	3	3
743	 Suppose you'll be wanting something to eat.	56	3	3
744	 I'm famished, actually.	56	3	3
745	 I think we've got a spare partridge on the fire.	57	3	3
746	 Well, I do like partridge.	57	3	3
747	 Bring the bird over here and the carving knife.	57	3	3
748	 Will this work as a table, my lord?	57	3	3
749	 Oh, yes. Yes, this will do nic--	57	3	3
750	 ah!	57	3	3
751	 On the stump.	57	3	3
752	 You think you're the smartest man there is.	57	3	3
753	 That everyone alive has to bow and scrape	57	3	3
754	 and lick your boots.	57	3	3
755	 - My father-- - And if you get in any trouble,	57	3	3
756	" all you've got to do is say ""my father"""	57	3	3
757	 and that's it, all your troubles are gone.	57	3	3
758	 - Don't. - Have you got something to say?	58	3	3
759	 Careful. You don't want to say the wrong thing.	58	3	3
760	 You're nothing without your daddy,	58	3	3
761	 and your daddy ain't here.	58	3	3
762	 Never forget that.	58	3	3
763	 Here, this should help you remember.	58	3	3
764		58	3	3
765	  All black and brown and covered with hair 	58	3	3
766	  Three boys, a goat, and a dancing bear 	58	3	3
767	  They danced and spun right to the fair 	58	3	3
768	  How sweet she was, so pure and fair 	58	3	3
769	  The maid with honey up in her hair 	58	3	3
770	  He smelled her all in the summer air 	59	3	3
771	  The maid with honey up in her hair 	59	3	3
772	  From there to here, from here to there 	59	3	3
773	  All black and brown and covered in hair 	59	3	3
774	  He smelled that girl in the summer air 	59	3	3
775	 -  The bear, the bear  -  The maiden fair 	59	3	3
776	  Oh, I'm a maid and I'm pure and fair 	59	3	3
777	  I'll never dance with a hairy bear 	59	3	3
778	  I called a knight, but you're a bear 	59	3	3
779	  All black and brown and covered in hair 	59	3	3
780	  From there to here, from here to there 	59	3	3
781	  All black and brown and covered in hair 	59	3	3
782	  He smelled that girl in the summer air 	59	3	3
783	 -  The bear, the bear  -  The maiden fair. 	59	3	3

6	 The Lord of Light has made good on his promise, my king.	2	5	10
7	 His fires have melted the snows away.	2	5	10
8	 The way ahead is clear.	2	5	10
9	 We ride for Winterfell.	2	5	10
10	 And you will take it.	2	5	10
11	 The Lord has shown me Bolton banners burning.	2	5	10
12	 You will receive what is yours by right.	2	5	10
13	 Your Grace.	2	5	10
14	 Prepare to form up.	2	5	10
15	 Your Grace.	2	5	10
16	 Tell me.	2	5	10
17	 The men, many deserted before dawn.	2	5	10
18	 How many?	3	5	10
19	 Nearly half.	3	5	10
20	 All the sellswords with all the horses.	3	5	10
21	 Your Grace.	3	5	10
22	 Speak up. Can't be worse than mutiny.	3	5	10
23	 Cut her down.	3	5	10
24	 Your Grace.	4	5	10
25	 The Lady Melisandre was just seen riding out of camp.	4	5	10
26	 Get the men into marching formation.	4	5	10
27	 On to Winterfell.	4	5	10
28	 He raised his hands	4	5	10
29	 and they all stood up at once.	4	5	10
30	 Tens of thousands of them. The biggest army in the world.	4	5	10
31	 So what are you gonna do?	4	5	10
32	 I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the Wall.	4	5	10
33	 But the dragonglass...	4	5	10
34	 No one's ever getting that back now.	5	5	10
35	 It wouldn't have mattered anyway.	5	5	10
36	 Not unless we had a mountain of it.	5	5	10
37	 But you killed a white walker.	5	5	10
38	 With Longclaw.	5	5	10
39	 I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass.	5	5	10
40	 - But Longclaw... -  Is Valyrian steel.	5	5	10
41	 How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?	5	5	10
42	 Not enough.	5	5	10
43	 The first Lord Commander in history	5	5	10
44	 to sacrifice the lives of sworn brothers	5	5	10
45	 to save the lives of wildlings.	5	5	10
46	 How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black?	5	5	10
47	 You were friends with me when I first came here.	5	5	10
48	 And I wasn't winning any elections back then.	5	5	10
49	 Here's to us, then.	5	5	10
50	 Long may they sneer.	5	5	10
51	 What?	5	5	10
52	 I wanted to ask you something.	5	5	10
53	 To ask something of you.	6	5	10
54	 Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown	6	5	10
55	 so I can become a maester.	6	5	10
56	 That's what I'm meant to be. Not this.	6	5	10
57	 I need you here, Sam.	6	5	10
58	 If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust?	6	5	10
59	 Well, there's Edd.	6	5	10
60	 I'd be more use to you as a maester.	6	5	10
61	 More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon is gone.	6	5	10
62	 The Citadel has the world's greatest library.	6	5	10
63	 I'll learn about history,	6	5	10
64	 strategy, healing.	6	5	10
65	 And other things,	6	5	10
66	 things that will help when--	6	5	10
67	 when they come.	6	5	10
68	 If Gilly stays here, then she'll die.	6	5	10
69	 And the baby that she named after me will die.	6	5	10
70	 And I'll end up dying, too, trying to protect them.	6	5	10
71	 Which means that the last thing that I'll see in this world	7	5	10
72	 will be the look in her eyes when I fail them.	7	5	10
73	 And I'd rather see a thousand white walkers than see that.	7	5	10
74	 Thank you.	7	5	10
75	 You know that the Citadel will make you swear off women, too.	7	5	10
76	 Oh, they'll bloody try.	7	5	10
77	 - Sam. - What?	7	5	10
78	 Sam.	7	5	10
79	 You had just been beaten half to death. How did you--	7	5	10
80	 Oh, very carefully.	7	5	10
81	 I'm glad the end of the world's	7	5	10
82	 working out well for someone.	7	5	10
83	 I'll come back.	8	5	10
84	 To your return.	8	5	10
85	 To my return.	8	5	10
86	 Aye, this way.	9	5	10
87	 My lady!	10	5	10
88	 Stannis.	10	5	10
89	 Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.	10	5	10
90	 How do you know it's Stannis?	10	5	10
91	 They're carrying his flaming heart banners.	10	5	10
92	 From the Blackwater. I'll never forget it.	10	5	10
93	 Trench here.	11	5	10
94	 Another one 300 yards from the castle wall.	11	5	10
95	 Hurry them along.	11	5	10
96	 - Right, Curlew. - Yes, sir.	11	5	10
97	 Dig between those two rises.	11	5	10
98	 - Spread out. -  I'm with you.	11	5	10
99	 - Archers! - Spread out!	11	5	10
100	 And send out a foraging party immediately.	11	5	10
101	 Siege begins at sunrise.	11	5	10
102	 There's not going to be a siege, Your Grace.	11	5	10
103	 We've got no chance!	12	5	10
104	 No, please, please.	13	5	10
105	 Bolton has women fighting for him?	14	5	10
106	 I don't fight for the Boltons.	14	5	10
107	 I'm Brienne of Tarth.	14	5	10
108	 I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.	14	5	10
109	 I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face.	14	5	10
110	 You murdered him with blood magic?	14	5	10
111	 I did.	15	5	10
112	 In the name of Renly of House Baratheon,	15	5	10
113	 First of His Name,	15	5	10
114	 rightful King of the Andals and the First Men,	15	5	10
115	 Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm,	15	5	10
116	 I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die.	15	5	10
117	 Do you have any last words?	15	5	10
118	 Go on, do your duty.	15	5	10
119	 Looks like we're done here.	16	5	10
120	 I surrender! I surrender!	16	5	10
121	 And I accept your surrender.	16	5	10
122	 Let's head back.	16	5	10
123	 My wife must be lonely.	16	5	10
124	 My lady.	17	5	10
125	 I've come to escort you back to your chamber.	17	5	10
126	 Go with her, please.	17	5	10
127	 I know what Ramsay is.	17	5	10
128	 I know what he'll do to me.	17	5	10
129	 If I'm going to die,	17	5	10
130	 let it happen while there's still some of me left.	17	5	10
131	 Die?	17	5	10
132	 Who said anything about dying?	17	5	10
133	 You can't die.	17	5	10
134	 Your father was Warden of the North.	17	5	10
135	 Ramsay needs you.	17	5	10
136	 Though I suppose he doesn't need all of you.	17	5	10
137	 Just the parts he'll use to make his heir,	17	5	10
138	 until you've given him a boy or two and he's finished using them.	17	5	10
139	 Then he's got incredible plans for those parts.	18	5	10
140	 So, shall we wait for him to come back	18	5	10
141	 or should we begin now?	18	5	10
142	 You're leaving it to me?	18	5	10
143	 Good.	18	5	10
144	 Let's begin.	18	5	10
145	 Reek-- stop!	18	5	10
146	 Stop!	18	5	10
147	 -  Open the gate!	18	5	10
148	 He's coming back.	18	5	10
149	 I can see I have my work cut out for me.	20	5	10
150	 You two, out.	20	5	10
151	 You were the first person on my list, you know.	21	5	10
152	 For killing Syrio Forel. Remember him?	21	5	10
153	 Probably not.	21	5	10
154	 I've gotten a few of the others.	21	5	10
155	 The Many-Faced God stole a few more from me.	21	5	10
156	 But I'm glad he left me you.	21	5	10
157	 Do you know who I am?	21	5	10
158	 I can't hear you.	21	5	10
159	 You know who I am.	21	5	10
160	 I'm Arya Stark.	21	5	10
161	 Do you know who you are?	22	5	10
162	 You're no one.	22	5	10
163	 You're nothing.	22	5	10
164	 A girl has taken a life.	23	5	10
165	 The wrong life.	23	5	10
166	 I was right about her.	23	5	10
167	 You were.	23	5	10
168	 You're not ready.	23	5	10
169	 Not at all.	23	5	10
170	 That man's life was not yours to take.	23	5	10
171	 A girl stole from the Many-Faced God.	23	5	10
172	 Now a debt is owed.	23	5	10
173	 Only death can pay for life.	23	5	10
174	 No! No!	23	5	10
175	 No, you-- don't die! Don't die!	23	5	10
176	 Why are you crying?	24	5	10
177	 He was my friend.	24	5	10
178	 No, he wasn't. Didn't you listen to him?	24	5	10
179	 He was no one.	24	5	10
180	 But if you're--	24	5	10
181	 who's this?	24	5	10
182	 No one at all.	24	5	10
183	 Just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall.	24	5	10
184	 The faces are for no one.	24	5	10
185	 You are still someone.	24	5	10
186	 And to someone,	24	5	10
187	 the faces are as good as poison.	24	5	10
188	 I can't see.	25	5	10
189	 What's happening?	25	5	10
190	 What's happening?!	25	5	10
191	 - I wish you a safe journey home. - Thank you.	25	5	10
192	 Forgive me, child.	25	5	10
193	 I wish you all the happiness in the world.	25	5	10
194	 Maybe I'll come visit you sometime.	25	5	10
195	 Maybe I'll come visit you.	25	5	10
196	 Don't wait too long.	25	5	10
197	 Got a noblewoman to marry back home.	25	5	10
198	 You want a good girl,	26	5	10
199	 but you need the bad pussy.	26	5	10
200	 Whenever you're ready, my lord.	26	5	10
201	 Try not to lose it this time.	26	5	10
202	 I'll never take it off again.	26	5	10
203	 I know you didn't want to leave Dorne,	26	5	10
204	 but I'm glad you're coming home.	26	5	10
205	 Your mother's desperate to see you.	26	5	10
206	 I'm glad Trystane is coming with us.	26	5	10
207	 He seems like a nice boy.	26	5	10
208	 You're lucky.	26	5	10
209	 Arranged marriages are rarely so--	26	5	10
210	 so well arranged.	26	5	10
211	 Do you think Mother will like him?	26	5	10
212	 If she sees you're happy, I'm sure she will.	26	5	10
213	 You really believe that?	26	5	10
214	 Have you ever known your mother to like anyone	27	5	10
215	 aside from her children?	27	5	10
216	 She likes you.	27	5	10
217	 I'm not so sure about that.	27	5	10
218	 Listen...	27	5	10
219	 there's something I wanted to tell you.	27	5	10
220	 Something I should have told you long ago.	27	5	10
221	 So...	27	5	10
222	 now that you've seen more of the world,	27	5	10
223	 you've learned how complicated things can be,	27	5	10
224	 people can be.	27	5	10
225	 The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years,	27	5	10
226	 but you've fallen in love with Trystane.	27	5	10
227	 It was an accident, really. I mean, what were the chances?	27	5	10
228	 You happen to fall in love with the man	27	5	10
229	 you were assigned to marry?	27	5	10
230	 My point is...	27	5	10
231	 we don't choose whom we love.	27	5	10
232	 It just, well--	27	5	10
233	 it's beyond our control.	27	5	10
234	 - I sound like an idiot. - No, you don't.	27	5	10
235	 What I'm trying to say-- what I'm trying	28	5	10
236	 and failing to say--	28	5	10
237	 I know what you're trying to say.	28	5	10
238	 No, I'm afraid you don't.	28	5	10
239	 I do.	28	5	10
240	 I know.	28	5	10
241	 About you and Mother.	28	5	10
242	 I think a part of me always knew.	28	5	10
243	 And I'm glad.	28	5	10
244	 I'm glad that you're my father.	28	5	10
245	 Myrcella?	29	5	10
246	 Myrcella?	29	5	10
247	 Myrcella? Myrcella?	29	5	10
248	 You love her, don't you?	30	5	10
249	 How could you not?	30	5	10
250	 Of course it's hopeless for the both of you.	30	5	10
251	 A sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight.	30	5	10
252	 Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen.	30	5	10
253	 But we always want the wrong woman.	30	5	10
254	 Does he always talk so much?	31	5	10
255	 Jorah the Andal.	31	5	10
256	 Torgo Nudho.	31	5	10
257	 He should not be here.	31	5	10
258	 No, but he is.	31	5	10
259	 Our queen ordered him exiled from city.	31	5	10
260	 Our queen would be dead if not for him.	31	5	10
261	 Puila. Thank you.	31	5	10
262	 I am sorry.	31	5	10
263	 Sorry I not there to fight for our queen.	31	5	10
264	 You missed a good scrap.	31	5	10
265	 None of that matters now.	31	5	10
266	 The longer we sit here bantering,	31	5	10
267	 the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.	31	5	10
268	 He's right. The dragon headed north.	31	5	10
269	 If we're going to find her, that's where we'll have to go.	31	5	10
270	 We?	32	5	10
271	 You're a Lannister.	32	5	10
272	 The queen intends to remove your family from power.	32	5	10
273	 And I intend to help her do it.	32	5	10
274	 You've been here for how many days now?	32	5	10
275	 I've fought for her for years.	32	5	10
276	 Since she was little more than a child.	32	5	10
277	 - You betrayed her. - Careful now.	32	5	10
278	 And she exiled you. Twice, I believe.	32	5	10
279	 The second time thanks to you.	32	5	10
280	 Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont.	32	5	10
281	 He's right. Our queen exiled Jorah.	32	5	10
282	 And he's right. Jorah saved her life.	32	5	10
283	 Perhaps she feels differently about him now.	32	5	10
284	 Perhaps not. The only way we'll know is if we ask her.	32	5	10
285	 Fine, fine. I suppose he can join us.	32	5	10
286	 Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep.	32	5	10
287	 If I ever kill you, your eyes will be wide open.	32	5	10
288	 Forgive me, but why would we bring you?	32	5	10
289	 Pardon me?	32	5	10
290	 Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?	32	5	10
291	 Not precisely, but I have other skills that would be useful.	32	5	10
292	 Can you fight?	32	5	10
293	 I have fought.	32	5	10
294	 I don't claim to be a great warrior.	32	5	10
295	 Are you good on a horse?	32	5	10
296	 Middling.	32	5	10
297	 So mainly you talk.	33	5	10
298	 And drink. I've survived so far.	33	5	10
299	 Which I respect, but you would not help us on this expedition.	33	5	10
300	 You would help us here in Meereen, though.	33	5	10
301	 None of us have experience governing a city	33	5	10
302	 except for him.	33	5	10
303	 You want to prove your value to the queen?	33	5	10
304	 Prove it right here in Meereen.	33	5	10
305	 He's a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language.	33	5	10
306	 Why would the Meereenese listen to him?	33	5	10
307	 They wouldn't.	33	5	10
308	 They will listen to Grey Worm.	33	5	10
309	 I'll come with you.	33	5	10
310	 I'll find our queen.	33	5	10
311	 - You are not strong enough to go anywhere. - I am.	33	5	10
312	 He is. He's the toughest man with no balls I ever met.	33	5	10
313	 But you still can't go.	33	5	10
314	 The people believe in you.	33	5	10
315	 They know you speak for the queen.	33	5	10
316	 It's true.	33	5	10
317	 Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen.	33	5	10
318	 If you leave, half this city will consume the other half.	33	5	10
319	 And Missandei.	33	5	10
320	 Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei.	33	5	10
321	 Certainly not me.	33	5	10
322	 The queen's closest confidante,	33	5	10
323	 the commander of the Unsullied,	34	5	10
324	 and a foreign dwarf with a scarred face.	34	5	10
325	 Good fortune, my friends.	34	5	10
326	 Meereen is ancient and glorious.	34	5	10
327	 Try not to ruin her.	34	5	10
328	 Looks like it's you and me, Jorah the Andal.	34	5	10
329	 Let's find some good horses.	34	5	10
330	 We have so much to talk about.	34	5	10
331	 Hello, old friend.	34	5	10
332	 I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.	34	5	10
333	 I suppose there's no point asking how you found me.	35	5	10
334	 The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east,	35	5	10
335	 if one knows how to listen.	35	5	10
336	 They tell me you've already found favor	35	5	10
337	 with the Mother of Dragons.	35	5	10
338	 Well, she didn't execute me,	35	5	10
339	 so that's a promising start.	35	5	10
340	 Now the heroes are off to find her	35	5	10
341	 and I'm stuck here	35	5	10
342	 trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war.	35	5	10
343	 Any advice for an old comrade?	35	5	10
344	 Information is the key.	35	5	10
345	 You need to learn your enemy's strengths and strategies.	35	5	10
346	 You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.	35	5	10
347	 If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.	35	5	10
348	 If only.	35	5	10
349	 A grand old city	35	5	10
350	 choking on violence, corruption, and deceit.	35	5	10
351	 Who could possibly have any experience	35	5	10
352	 managing such a massive, ungainly beast?	35	5	10
353	 I did miss you.	36	5	10
354	 Oh, I know.	36	5	10
355	 We have to go home.	36	5	10
356	 Oh, my poor, sweet thing.	36	5	10
357	 Does it hurt?	36	5	10
358	 We have to go home.	36	5	10
359	 Drogon.	36	5	10
360	 Can you take me back to Meereen?	36	5	10
361	 How far did you carry me?	36	5	10
362	 Drogon, we need to return.	37	5	10
363	 My people need me.	37	5	10
364	 Well, there's no food.	37	5	10
365	 At the very least, you could hunt us some supper.	37	5	10
366	 Confess.	40	5	10
367	 Confess.	40	5	10
368	 I have sinned.	40	5	10
369	 I see that now.	40	5	10
370	 How can I have been so blind for so long?	40	5	10
371	 I want to be clean again.	40	5	10
372	 I want absolution.	40	5	10
373	 The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high.	40	5	10
374	 And by its holy light--	41	5	10
375	 You wish to make a confession?	41	5	10
376	 Once I've confessed, will I be free?	41	5	10
377	 Your Grace will be dealt with according to her sins.	41	5	10
378	 The Mother have mercy, then.	41	5	10
379	 I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage. I confess.	41	5	10
380	 Name him.	41	5	10
381	 Lancel Lannister.	41	5	10
382	 Your cousin and the king's squire.	41	5	10
383	 - I was lonely and afraid. - You had a husband.	41	5	10
384	 A husband off whoring every chance he--	41	5	10
385	 His sins do not pardon your own.	41	5	10
386	 May the gods forgive me.	41	5	10
387	 Other men?	41	5	10
388	 No.	41	5	10
389	 No others?	41	5	10
390	 No.	41	5	10
391	 Speaking falsehoods before the gods is a great crime.	41	5	10
392	 You understand this?	42	5	10
393	 I do.	42	5	10
394	 There are those that say your children	42	5	10
395	 were not fathered by King Robert,	42	5	10
396	 that they are bastards born of incest and adultery.	42	5	10
397	 A lie.	42	5	10
398	 A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon.	42	5	10
399	 He wants the throne, but his brother's 4 children stand in his way.	42	5	10
400	 So he claims they are not his brother's.	42	5	10
401	 That filth.	42	5	10
402	 There is not one shred of truth to it.	42	5	10
403	 I deny it.	42	5	10
404	 Good.	42	5	10
405	 But these are terrible charges.	42	5	10
406	 And the realm must know the truth of them.	42	5	10
407	 If Your Grace has given honest testimony,	42	5	10
408	 your trial will prove your innocence.	42	5	10
409	 Trial? I have confessed.	42	5	10
410	 To a single sin.	42	5	10
411	 Others you have denied.	42	5	10
412	 Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.	42	5	10
413	 I bow to the wisdom of Your High Holiness.	43	5	10
414	 But if I might beg	43	5	10
415	 for just one drop of the Mother's mercy.	43	5	10
416	 I haven't seen my son--	43	5	10
417	 I don't know how long it's been.	43	5	10
418	 I need to see him, please.	43	5	10
419	 You have taken the first step on the path back to righteousness.	43	5	10
420	 In light of this,	43	5	10
421	 I will permit you to return to the Red Keep.	43	5	10
422	 Thank you.	43	5	10
423	 Thank you.	43	5	10
424	 The Mother is merciful.	43	5	10
425	 It is her you should thank.	43	5	10
426	 I will. I will.	43	5	10
427	 I swear it, day and night.	43	5	10
428	 Good.	43	5	10
429	 Am I free to go?	43	5	10
430	 After your atonement.	43	5	10
431	 My atonement?	43	5	10
432	 A sinner comes before you.	46	5	10
433	 Cersei of House Lannister.	46	5	10
434	 Mother to His Grace King Tommen.	46	5	10
435	 Widow of His Grace King Robert.	46	5	10
436	 She has committed the acts of falsehood	46	5	10
437	 and fornication.	46	5	10
438	 She has confessed her sins	46	5	10
439	 and begged for forgiveness.	46	5	10
440	 To demonstrate her repentance,	46	5	10
441	 she will cast aside all pride, all artifice,	46	5	10
442	 and present herself as the gods made her	46	5	10
443	 to you,	46	5	10
444	 the good people of the city.	46	5	10
445	 She comes before you with a solemn heart,	46	5	10
446	 shorn of secrets,	46	5	10
447	 naked before the eyes of gods and men...	46	5	10
448	 to make her walk of atonement.	47	5	10
449	 Shame. Shame.	47	5	10
450	 Shame.	47	5	10
451	 Shame.	47	5	10
452	 Shame. Shame.	47	5	10
453	 Shame.	47	5	10
454	 Shame. Shame.	47	5	10
455	 Shame.	47	5	10
456	 Shame. Shame.	47	5	10
457	 -  Shame. Shame.	47	5	10
458	 Shame.	48	5	10

528	 Your Grace.	52	5	10
529	 It's good to have you back.	52	5	10
530	 Come.	52	5	10
531	 We'll take you inside.	52	5	10
532	 I need to have a look at those feet.	52	5	10
533	 May I have the honor of presenting the newest member of the Kingsguard?	52	5	10
534	 If it please Your Grace, he has taken a holy vow of silence.	52	5	10
535	 He has sworn that he will not speak	52	5	10
536	 until all His Grace's enemies are dead	52	5	10
537	 and evil has been driven from the realm.	52	5	10
538	 Who came to your aid? Stannis.	53	5	10
539	 Now he needs you.	53	5	10
540	 We don't have enough men to make any difference.	53	5	10
541	 The wildlings will make a difference.	53	5	10
542	 The wildlings will never fight for Stannis.	53	5	10
543	 - I told him before. - You saved their bloody lives.	53	5	10
544	 If they're gonna live in the Seven Kingdoms,	53	5	10
545	 safe behind our Wall, they ought to fight for the damn place.	53	5	10
546	 - It's not their fight. -  Open the gates!	53	5	10
547	 Stannis?	53	5	10
548	 Shireen? The princess?	53	5	10
549	 Lord Commander.	54	5	10
550	 It's one of the wildlings you brought back.	54	5	10
551	 Says he knows your Uncle Benjen.	54	5	10
552	 Says he's still alive.	54	5	10
553	 Are you sure he's talking about Benjen?	54	5	10
554	 Said he was First Ranger.	54	5	10
555	 Said he knows where to find him.	55	5	10
556	 Man says he saw your uncle at Hardhome	55	5	10
557	 at the last full moon.	55	5	10
558	 - Could be lying. - Could be.	55	5	10
559	 There are ways to find out.	55	5	10
560	 - Where is he? - Over there.	55	5	10
561	 For the Watch.	55	5	10
562	 For the Watch.	55	5	10
563	 For the Watch.	55	5	10
564	 For the Watch.	55	5	10
565	 For the Watch.	55	5	10

0	 Yah! Left high, left low.	2	1	8
1	 Right low, lunge right.	2	1	8
2	 You break anything, the Septa will have my head.	2	1	8
3	 What is--	2	1	8
4	 Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.	2	1	8
5	 - How she could forget-- - She didn't forget.	2	1	8
6	 She's with her dancing master. She's with him every morning.	2	1	8
7	 She always comes back with scrapes and bruises. She's so clumsy.	2	1	8
8	 Hush!	2	1	8
9	 Go back to your room.	2	1	8
10	 Bar the doors	2	1	8
11	 and do not open them for anyone you do not know.	3	1	8
12	 - What is it? What's happening? - Do as I told you.	3	1	8
13	 Run!	3	1	8
14	 This way!	3	1	8
15	 Left, right. Rah!	3	1	8
16	 Now you are dead.	3	1	8
17	 You said right,	3	1	8
18	 but you went left.	3	1	8
19	 And now you are a dead girl.	3	1	8
20	 Only 'cause you lied.	3	1	8
21	 My tongue lied. My eyes	3	1	8
22	 shouted the truth. You were not seeing.	3	1	8
23	 I was so. I watched, but you--	3	1	8
24	 watching is not seeing, dead girl.	3	1	8
25	 The seeing, the true seeing,	3	1	8
26	 that is the heart of swordplay.	3	1	8
27	 Arya Stark, come with us.	4	1	8
28	 Your father wants to see you.	4	1	8
29	 And why is it	4	1	8
30	 that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men	4	1	8
31	 in place of his own? I am wondering.	4	1	8
32	 Mind your place, dancing master.	4	1	8
33	 This is no concern of yours.	4	1	8
34	 My father wouldn't send you.	4	1	8
35	 And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.	4	1	8
36	 Take her.	4	1	8
37	 Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?	4	1	8
38	 Get out of my way, little man.	4	1	8
39	 I am Syrio Forel...	4	1	8
40	 Foreign bastard.	4	1	8
41	 ...And you will be speaking to me with more respect.	4	1	8
42	 Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.	4	1	8
43	 Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.	4	1	8
44	 Run to your father.	4	1	8
45	 Bloody oafs.	5	1	8
46	 Be gone now, Arya.	5	1	8
47	 Come with me. Run.	5	1	8
48	 The first sword of Braavos does not run.	5	1	8
49	 What do we say	5	1	8
50	 to the God of death?	5	1	8
51	 Not today.	5	1	8
52	 Go.	5	1	8
53	 Not today. Not today.	6	1	8
54	 Stay away from me.	6	1	8
55	 I'll tell my father.	6	1	8
56	 I'll-- I'll tell the Queen.	6	1	8
57	 Who do you think sent me?	6	1	8
58	 Needle.	6	1	8
59	 There she is.	7	1	8
60	 - What do you want? - I want you, wolf girl.	7	1	8
61	 - Come here. - Leave me be.	7	1	8
62	 My father's a lord. He'll reward you.	7	1	8
63	 She'll reward me-- the Queen!	7	1	8
64	 Stay away!	7	1	8
65	 Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.	7	1	8
66	 Varys.	7	1	8
67	 I promise you it isn't poisoned.	7	1	8
68	 Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?	8	1	8
69	 Not so much, My Lord.	8	1	8
70	 I would save the rest, if I were you.	8	1	8
71	 Hide it. Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.	8	1	8
72	 What about my daughters?	8	1	8
73	 The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.	8	1	8
74	 Even my little birds cannot find her.	8	1	8
75	 - And Sansa? - Still engaged to Joffrey.	8	1	8
76	 Cersei will keep her close. The rest of your household though--	8	1	8
77	 all dead, it grieves me to say.	8	1	8
78	 I do so hate the sight of blood.	8	1	8
79	 You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.	8	1	8
80	 And would again, My Lord.	8	1	8
81	 I was unarmed, unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords.	8	1	8
82	 When you look at me do you see a hero?	8	1	8
83	 What madness led you to tell the Queen	9	1	8
84	 you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth?	9	1	8
85	 The madness of mercy.	9	1	8
86	 That she might save her children.	9	1	8
87	 Ah, the children.	9	1	8
88	 It is always the innocents who suffer.	9	1	8
89	 It wasn't the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.	9	1	8
90	 The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open,	9	1	8
91	 but it was your mercy that killed the King.	9	1	8
92	 I trust you know you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?	9	1	8
93	 The Queen can't kill me.	9	1	8
94	 Cat holds her brother.	9	1	8
95	 The wrong brother sadly.	9	1	8
96	 And lost to her.	9	1	8
97	 Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.	9	1	8
98	 If that's true,	10	1	8
99	 then slit my throat and be done with it.	10	1	8
100	 Not today, My Lord.	10	1	8
101	 Tell me something, Varys.	10	1	8
102	 Who do you truly serve?	10	1	8
103	 The Realm, My Lord.	10	1	8
104	 Someone must.	10	1	8
105	 It's Othor, without a doubt.	10	1	8
106	 The other one is Jafer Flowers, My Lord,	10	1	8
107	 less the hand the wolf tore off.	10	1	8
108	 Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?	10	1	8
109	 Just these two, My Lord.	10	1	8
110	 Been dead awhile, I'd say.	10	1	8
111	 - Mmm. - The smell.	11	1	8
112	 What smell?	11	1	8
113	 There is none.	11	1	8
114	 If they'd be dead for a long time, wouldn't there be rot?	11	1	8
115	 We should burn them.	11	1	8
116	 Snow's not wrong, My Lord. Fire will do for them.	11	1	8
117	 The Wildling way.	11	1	8
118	 I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.	11	1	8
119	 You may be a coward, Tarly,	11	1	8
120	 but you're not stupid.	11	1	8
121	 - Get them inside. - You heard him.	11	1	8
122	 Lord Commander,	11	1	8
123	 Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers--	11	1	8
124	 a raven from King's Landing.	11	1	8
125	 Come on, move 'em out.	11	1	8
126	 Bring me a horn of ale, Snow,	12	1	8
127	 and pour one for yourself.	12	1	8
128	 The King is dead.	12	1	8
129	 Is there any word of my father?	12	1	8
130	 Sit.	12	1	8
131	 Lord Stark has been	12	1	8
132	 charged with treason.	12	1	8
133	 They say he conspired with Robert's brothers	12	1	8
134	 to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.	12	1	8
135	 I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.	13	1	8
136	 Your duty lies here now.	13	1	8
137	 My sisters were in King's Landing too.	13	1	8
138	 I'm sure they'll be	13	1	8
139	 treated gently.	13	1	8
140	 Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.	13	1	8
141	 King Robert's body was still warm	13	1	8
142	 when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.	13	1	8
143	 He wouldn't do that.	13	1	8
144	 He knows how much I love Joffrey. He wouldn't.	13	1	8
145	 Please, Your Grace, there's been a mistake.	13	1	8
146	 Send for my father. He'll tell you-- the King was his friend.	13	1	8
147	 Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong. We know that.	13	1	8
148	 Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.	13	1	8
149	 How can I allow you to marry my son?	13	1	8
150	 A child born of a traitor's seed	13	1	8
151	 is no fit consort for our King.	14	1	8
152	 She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace,	14	1	8
153	 but in 10 years who knows	14	1	8
154	 what treasons she may hatch?	14	1	8
155	 No, I'm not. I'll be a good wife to him, you'll see.	14	1	8
156	 I'll be a Queen just like you, I promise. I won't hatch anything.	14	1	8
157	 The girl is innocent, Your Grace.	14	1	8
158	 She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.	14	1	8
159	 Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn	14	1	8
160	 and your brother, the eldest, what's his name?	14	1	8
161	 Robb.	14	1	8
162	 Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.	14	1	8
163	 Best it comes from you.	14	1	8
164	 If you would help your father,	14	1	8
165	 urge your brother to keep the King's peace.	14	1	8
166	 Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.	14	1	8
167	 If-- if I could see my father, talk to him about--	15	1	8
168	 You disappoint me, child.	15	1	8
169	 We have told you of your father's treason.	15	1	8
170	 Why would you want to speak to a traitor?	15	1	8
171	 I only meant that--	15	1	8
172	 what will happen to him?	15	1	8
173	 - That depends. - On-- on what?	15	1	8
174	 On your brother.	15	1	8
175	 And on you.	15	1	8
176	 Treason?	15	1	8
177	 Sansa wrote this?	15	1	8
178	 It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words.	15	1	8
179	 You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new King.	15	1	8
180	 Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?	15	1	8
181	 This is a royal command, My Lord.	16	1	8
182	 - If you should refuse to obey-- - I won't refuse.	16	1	8
183	 His Grace summons me to King's Landing,	16	1	8
184	 I'll go to King's Landing.	16	1	8
185	 But not alone.	16	1	8
186	 Call the banners.	16	1	8
187	 All of them, My Lord?	16	1	8
188	 They've all sworn to defend my father, have they not?	16	1	8
189	 They have.	16	1	8
190	 Now we see what their words are worth.	16	1	8
191	 Yeah.	16	1	8
192	 Are you afraid?	16	1	8
193	 I must be.	16	1	8
194	 Good.	16	1	8
195	 Why is that good?	16	1	8
196	 It means you're not stupid.	16	1	8
197	 You've had this since dawn?	17	1	8
198	 He sent it to me, not you.	17	1	8
199	 I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.	17	1	8
200	 A courtesy?!	17	1	8
201	 My husband has been taken prisoner.	17	1	8
202	 My son intends to declare war.	17	1	8
203	 A war?	17	1	8
204	 Your son against the Lannisters?	17	1	8
205	 You should go to him. Teach him patience.	17	1	8
206	 Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?	17	1	8
207	 He is your brother by law!	17	1	8
208	 Does family mean nothing to you?	17	1	8
209	 Family means everything to me.	17	1	8
210	 And I will not risk Robin's life	17	1	8
211	 to get caught up in another of your husband's wars.	17	1	8
212	 - I'm hungry. - Hush now, darling.	18	1	8
213	 You just ate.	18	1	8
214	 You will not support us then? Do I understand you correctly?	18	1	8
215	 - But I'm hungry! - Soon, love, soon.	18	1	8
216	 You're always welcome here, sister.	18	1	8
217	 But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight--	18	1	8
218	 That is what I ask.	18	1	8
219	 Go on, sweet. Time for your bath.	18	1	8
220	 I'll feed you after.	18	1	8
221	 If you fear for the safety of your son--	18	1	8
222	 Of course I fear for the safety of my son!	18	1	8
223	 Are you an idiot?	18	1	8
224	 They killed my husband.	18	1	8
225	 You say they shoved your boy from a window.	18	1	8
226	 These people will do anything.	18	1	8
227	 And that is why we have to stop them.	18	1	8
228	 The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale	18	1	8
229	 where they belong, to protect their Lord.	19	1	8
230	 Will you shut up?	19	1	8
231	 There's hill tribes all around here.	19	1	8
232	 If I'm going to die,	19	1	8
233	 it may as well be with a song in my heart.	19	1	8
234	 I should just take your food and leave you here.	19	1	8
235	 Eh? What would you do then?	19	1	8
236	 Starve, most likely.	19	1	8
237	 You don't think I'd do it, do you?	19	1	8
238	 What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Women?	19	1	8
239	 Golden women?	19	1	8
240	 Stick with me and you'll have them all,	19	1	8
241	 for as long as I'm around and not for a moment longer.	19	1	8
242	 But you knew that.	19	1	8
243	 That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honor.	19	1	8
244	 Fair enough.	20	1	8
245	 But don't go looking for me to bend the knee	20	1	8
246	" and ""My Lord"" you every time you take a shit."	20	1	8
247	 I'm not your toady and I'm not your friend.	20	1	8
248	 Though I would treasure your friendship,	20	1	8
249	 I'm mainly interested in your facility with murder.	20	1	8
250	 And if the day ever comes when you're tempted to sell me out,	20	1	8
251	 remember this:	20	1	8
252	 Whatever their price, I'll beat it.	20	1	8
253	 I like living.	20	1	8
254	 Tyrion.	20	1	8
255	 Tyrion.	20	1	8
256	 Tyrion.	20	1	8
257	 Come, share our fire.	21	1	8
258	 Help yourselves to our goat.	21	1	8
259	 When you meet your Gods, you tell them	21	1	8
260	 Shagga Son of Dolf	21	1	8
261	 of the Stone Crows sent you.	21	1	8
262	 I am Tyrion son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.	21	1	8
263	 How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?	21	1	8
264	 In my own bed, at the age of 80	21	1	8
265	 with a bellyful of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.	21	1	8
266	 Take the half man.	21	1	8
267	 He can dance for the children. Kill the other one.	21	1	8
268	 No no no no no!	21	1	8
269	 My-- my House is rich and powerful.	22	1	8
270	 If you see us through these mountains,	22	1	8
271	 my father will shower you with gold.	22	1	8
272	 We have no use for a half man's promises.	22	1	8
273	 Half a man maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.	22	1	8
274	 What do the Stone Crows do?	22	1	8
275	 Hide behind rocks and shiver	22	1	8
276	 when the knights of the Vale ride by?	22	1	8
277	 Are those the best weapons you could steal?	22	1	8
278	 Good enough for killing sheep,	22	1	8
279	 if the sheep don't fight back.	22	1	8
280	 Lannister smiths shit better steel.	22	1	8
281	 You think you can win us over with your trinkets?	22	1	8
282	 That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.	22	1	8
283	 But if you help us, Shagga Son of Dolf,	23	1	8
284	 I will not give you trinkets.	23	1	8
285	 I will give you this.	23	1	8
286	" What is ""this""?"	23	1	8
287	 The Vale of Arryn.	23	1	8
288	 The Lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.	23	1	8
289	 The Lords of the Vale want me dead.	23	1	8
290	 I believe it is time for new Lords of the Vale.	23	1	8
291	 Ser  Now there's a rare sight--	23	1	8
292	 not only a bastard, but a traitor's bastard.	23	1	8
293	 - Jon, no! - Jon, stop, put it down!	23	1	8
294	 Blood will always tell.	23	1	8
295	 You'll hang for this, bastard.	24	1	8
296	 I told you not to do anything stupid.	24	1	8
297	 You're confined to quarters. Go.	24	1	8
298	 Ghost, what's wrong?	24	1	8
299	 Is something out there?	25	1	8
300	 Commander?	25	1	8
301	 Stay.	25	1	8
302	 Hello?	25	1	8
303	 Who's there?	26	1	8
304	 Lord Commander?	26	1	8
305	 Snow?	26	1	8
306	 Commander!	26	1	8
307	 Move move!	27	1	8
308	 What did they do?	27	1	8
309	 I thought the Dothraki didn't believe in money.	27	1	8
310	 Gold to hire ships, Princess,	27	1	8
311	 ships to sail to Westeros.	27	1	8
312	 Jorah, make them stop.	28	1	8
313	 - Khaleesi? - You heard me.	28	1	8
314	 These men have shed blood for their Khal. Now they claim their rewards.	28	1	8
315	 Princess, you have a gentle heart,	28	1	8
316	 but this is how it's always been.	28	1	8
317	 I do not have a gentle heart, Ser.	28	1	8
318	 Kash qoy qoyi thira disse. Me qorasokh anni!	28	1	8
319	 - Come. -  Anha afichak mae m'arakhoon!	28	1	8
320	 What do you want done with them?	29	1	8
321	 Bring her to me. And those women there.	29	1	8
322	 You cannot claim them all, Princess.	29	1	8
323	 I can,	29	1	8
324	 and I will.	29	1	8
325	 Me Fati!	29	1	8
326	 Khaleesi vazha anhaan qorasokh anni,	29	1	8
327	 ch'anha afichak mae m'arakhoon anni!	29	1	8
328	 Me vastoe hatif anni;	29	1	8
329	 ahhazaan yer Nemo vacchaki.	29	1	8
330	 Ohos.	31	1	8
331	 Os.	31	1	8
332	 Thank you, silver lady.	32	1	8
333	 Who are you?	32	1	8
334	 I am named Mirri Maz Duur. I was the Godswife of this Temple.	32	1	8
335	 My mother was Godswife here before me.	32	1	8
336	 She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments.	32	1	8
337	 All men are of one flock, so my people believe.	32	1	8
338	 The Great Shepherd sent me to Earth to heal his--	32	1	8
339	 lamb or lion,	33	1	8
340	 his wound must be washed and sewn	33	1	8
341	 or it will fester.	33	1	8
342	 For 30 years I've been making corpses	33	1	8
343	 out of men, boy.	33	1	8
344	 I'm the man you want leading the Vanguard.	33	1	8
345	 Galbart Glover will lead the Van.	33	1	8
346	 The bloody Wall will melt	33	1	8
347	 before an Umber marches behind a Glover.	33	1	8
348	 I will lead the Van	34	1	8
349	 or I will take my men	34	1	8
350	 and march them home.	34	1	8
351	 You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.	34	1	8
352	 And when I am done with the Lannisters	34	1	8
353	 I will march back North,	34	1	8
354	 root you out of your Keep	34	1	8
355	 and hang you for an oathbreaker.	34	1	8
356	 Oathbreaker, is it?!	34	1	8
357	 I'll not sit here and swallow insults	34	1	8
358	 from a boy so green he pisses grass.	34	1	8
359	 My Lord father taught me it was death to bare steel	34	1	8
360	 against your Liege Lord.	34	1	8
361	 But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.	34	1	8
362	 Your meat...	35	1	8
363	 is bloody tough.	35	1	8
364	 - What is it? What's happened? - Shh, it's all right.	35	1	8
365	 - Where are you going? - South. For father.	35	1	8
366	 But it's the middle of the night.	35	1	8
367	 The Lannisters have spies everywhere.	35	1	8
368	 I don't want them to know we're coming.	36	1	8
369	 They have more men than we do.	36	1	8
370	 Aye, they do.	36	1	8
371	 Can't I come with you?	36	1	8
372	 I can ride now. You've seen me riding.	36	1	8
373	 And I won't get in the way, I--	36	1	8
374	 There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.	36	1	8
375	 Until I return that will be you.	36	1	8
376	 You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone. Do you understand?	36	1	8
377	 Listen to Maester Luwin. Look after your little brother.	36	1	8
378	 I will.	36	1	8
379	 I'll send letters whenever I can,	36	1	8
380	 but if you don't hear from me,	36	1	8
381	 don't be scared.	36	1	8
382	 Until I return.	36	1	8
383	 How long have you been hiding out there?	37	1	8
384	 Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.	37	1	8
385	 They've all gone away.	37	1	8
386	 They'll be back soon. Robb will free father	37	1	8
387	 and they'll come back with mother.	37	1	8
388	 No, they won't.	37	1	8
389	 Please watch over Robb.	37	1	8
390	 And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.	37	1	8
391	 And Theon too, I suppose.	37	1	8
392	 You hear them, boy?	37	1	8
393	 The Old Gods are answering you.	37	1	8
394	 What are you doing here?	37	1	8
395	 They're my Gods too.	37	1	8
396	 Beyond the Wall, they're the only Gods.	38	1	8
397	 Even slaves are allowed to pray.	38	1	8
398	 You're not a slave.	38	1	8
399	 Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.	38	1	8
400	 I'm not complaining, Little Lord,	38	1	8
401	 just telling truths.	38	1	8
402	 What did you mean about hearing the Gods?	38	1	8
403	 You asked them,	38	1	8
404	 they're answering you.	38	1	8
405	 Shh.	38	1	8
406	 Open your ears.	38	1	8
407	 It's only the wind.	38	1	8
408	 Who do you think sends the wind	38	1	8
409	 if not the Gods?	38	1	8
410	 They see you, boy.	38	1	8
411	 They hear you.	38	1	8
412	 Your brother will get no help from them where he's going.	38	1	8
413	 The Old Gods have no power in the South.	38	1	8
414	 The Weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.	39	1	8
415	 How can they watch when they have no eyes?	39	1	8
416	 Well, there's a big man.	39	1	8
417	 He has giants' blood in him or I'm the Queen.	39	1	8
418	 Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.	39	1	8
419	 Go dress.	39	1	8
420	 Hodor.	39	1	8
421	 Are there really giants beyond the Wall?	39	1	8
422	 Giants and worse than giants.	39	1	8
423	 I tried telling your brother,	39	1	8
424	 he's marching the wrong way.	39	1	8
425	 All these swords, they should be going North, boy.	39	1	8
426	 North, not south!	39	1	8
427	 The cold winds are rising.	39	1	8
428	 They were touched by White Walkers.	40	1	8
429	 That's why they came back.	40	1	8
430	 That's why their eyes turned blue.	40	1	8
431	 Only fire will stop them.	40	1	8
432	 How do you know that?	40	1	8
433	 I read about it in a book--	40	1	8
434	 a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.	40	1	8
435	 What else did the book say?	40	1	8
436	 The White Walkers	40	1	8
437	 sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.	40	1	8
438	 And when they wake up--	40	1	8
439	 And when they wake up, what?	40	1	8
440	 I hope The Wall is high enough.	40	1	8
441	 Summer snows, My Lady.	41	1	8
442	 Robb's brought the North with him.	41	1	8
443	 The River Lords are falling back	41	1	8
444	 with Jaime Lannister at their heels.	41	1	8
445	 And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.	41	1	8
446	 Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's.	41	1	8
447	 One army or two, the Kings in the North	41	1	8
448	 threw back hosts 10 times as large.	41	1	8
449	 Mother!	41	1	8
450	 You look well.	42	1	8
451	 Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome sight in these troubled times.	42	1	8
452	 We had not thought to meet you here, My Lady.	42	1	8
453	 I had not thought to be here.	42	1	8
454	 I would speak with my son alone.	42	1	8
455	 I know you will forgive me, My Lords.	42	1	8
456	 You heard her! Move your asses!	42	1	8
457	 Come on, out.	42	1	8
458	 You too, Greyjoy. Are you bloody deaf?	42	1	8
459	 Have no fear, My Lady.	42	1	8
460	 We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole	42	1	8
461	 and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned.	42	1	8
462	 - You old devil, Rodrik. - Jon.	42	1	8
463	 You're not wasting away, are you?	42	1	8
464	 I remember the day you came into this world	42	1	8
465	 red-faced and squalling.	42	1	8
466	 And now I find you leading a host to war.	43	1	8
467	 - There was no one else. - No one?	43	1	8
468	 Who were those men I saw here?	43	1	8
469	 - None of them are Starks. - All of them are seasoned in battle.	43	1	8
470	 If you think you can send me back to Winterfell--	43	1	8
471	 Oh, would that I could.	43	1	8
472	 There was...	43	1	8
473	 a letter.	43	1	8
474	 From Sansa.	43	1	8
475	 From the Queen, you mean.	43	1	8
476	 - There's no mention of Arya. - No.	43	1	8
477	 How many men do you have?	43	1	8
478	 18,000.	43	1	8
479	 If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey--	44	1	8
480	 you would never be allowed to leave. No.	44	1	8
481	 Our best hope-- our only hope--	44	1	8
482	 is that you can defeat them in the field.	44	1	8
483	 And if I lose?	44	1	8
484	 Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children	44	1	8
485	 - when the Mad King fell? - They were butchered in their sleep.	44	1	8
486	 On the orders of Tywin Lannister.	44	1	8
487	 And the years have not made him kinder.	44	1	8
488	 If you lose,	44	1	8
489	 your father dies,	44	1	8
490	 your sisters die,	44	1	8
491	 we die.	44	1	8
492	 Well, that makes it simple then.	44	1	8
493	 I suppose it does.	44	1	8
494	 From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.	45	1	8
495	 Best for Tyrion son of Tywin.	45	1	8
496	 Not best for me.	45	1	8
497	 If the half man betrays us,	45	1	8
498	 Shagga Son of Dolf will cut off his manhood--	45	1	8
499	 and feed it to the goats, yes.	45	1	8
500	 All right then.	45	1	8
501	 Time to meet my father.	45	1	8
502	 - Tyrion. - Uncle.	46	1	8
503	 Father.	46	1	8
504	 The rumors of your demise were unfounded.	46	1	8
505	 Sorry to disappoint you.	46	1	8
506	 And who are these...	46	1	8
507	 Companions of yours?	46	1	8
508	 This is Shagga Son of Dolf,	46	1	8
509	 Chieftain of the Stone Crows.	46	1	8
510	 Timett Son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men.	46	1	8
511	 This fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk,	46	1	8
512	 leader of the Black Ears.	46	1	8
513	 And here we have Bronn son of...	46	1	8
514	 You wouldn't know him.	46	1	8
515	 May I present My Lord Father,	46	1	8
516	 Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister,	46	1	8
517	 Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?	47	1	8
518	 Kind of you to go to war for me.	47	1	8
519	 You left us no choice.	47	1	8
520	 The honor of the House was at stake.	47	1	8
521	 Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.	47	1	8
522	 We have our differences, Jaime and I.	47	1	8
523	 He's braver. I'm better looking.	47	1	8
524	 He's been covering himself in glory.	47	1	8
525	 Jaime smashed the River Lords at the Golden Tooth,	47	1	8
526	 and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.	47	1	8
527	 And the Starks? Lord Eddard?	47	1	8
528	 --Is our hostage. He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.	47	1	8
529	 How did my sweet sister persuade the King	47	1	8
530	 to imprison his dear friend Ned?	47	1	8
531	 Robert Baratheon is dead. Joffrey rules in King's Landing.	47	1	8
532	 My sister rules, you mean.	47	1	8
533	 Stark's son has called his banners.	47	1	8
534	 - He moves south with a strong host. - A green boy.	48	1	8
535	 One taste of battle and he'll run	48	1	8
536	 back to Winterfell wi his tail between his legs.	48	1	8
537	 Maybe.	48	1	8
538	 Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.	48	1	8
539	 You'd like him.	48	1	8
540	 While we're on the subject of war,	48	1	8
541	 I made promises to my friends here	48	1	8
542	 and a Lannister always pays his debts.	48	1	8
543	 We shall require 3,000 helms and shields,	48	1	8
544	 plus swords, pikes,	48	1	8
545	 gorgets, maces--	48	1	8
546	 if it please My Lord,	48	1	8
547	 Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen	48	1	8
548	 have crossed the neck.	48	1	8
549	 The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.	48	1	8
550	 So be it. Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.	48	1	8
551	 And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.	48	1	8
552	 At once, My Lord.	48	1	8
553	 It is said that the men of the Mountain clans are great warriors.	49	1	8
554	 Ride with me against my enemies	49	1	8
555	 and you shall have all my son promised you and more.	49	1	8
556	 Only if the half man fights with us.	49	1	8
557	 Until we hold the steel he pledged us,	49	1	8
558	 the little lion's life is ours.	49	1	8
559	 The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.	49	1	8
560	 We need to get him on broken ground,	49	1	8
561	 put his Knights at a disadvantage.	49	1	8
562	 No, we need to get around him	49	1	8
563	 and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.	49	1	8
564	 Do that and the River Lords will join us.	49	1	8
565	 To do either we need to cross the river	49	1	8
566	 and the only crossing is at The Twins.	49	1	8
567	 Lord Frey controls that bridge.	49	1	8
568	 Your father's bannerman.	49	1	8
569	" ""The late Lord Frey"" my father calls him."	49	1	8
570	 At the Trident, he didn't appear until the battle was done.	49	1	8
571	 Some men takes their oaths more seriously than others.	50	1	8
572	 Robb's right. We need that bridge.	50	1	8
573	 So what's it going to be?	50	1	8
574	 Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?	50	1	8
575	 Your pardon, my lords.	50	1	8
576	 We've captured a Lannister scout.	50	1	8
577	 Don't worry, lad. He won't b leaving this tent with his head.	50	1	8
578	 Where did you find him?	50	1	8
579	 In the brush above the encampment.	50	1	8
580	 He looked to be counting.	50	1	8
581	 How high did you get?	50	1	8
582	 20,000. Maybe more.	50	1	8
583	 You don't have to do this yourself.	51	1	8
584	 Your father would understand--	51	1	8
585	 My father unrstands mercy, when there is room for it.	51	1	8
586	 And he understands honor...	51	1	8
587	 and courage.	51	1	8
588	 Let him go.	51	1	8
589	 Robb.	51	1	8
590	 Tell Lord Tywin Winter is coming for him.	51	1	8
591	 20,000 Northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold.	51	1	8
592	 Yes, My Lord.	51	1	8
593	 Thank you, My Lord.	51	1	8
594	 Are you touched, boy?! Letting him go?	52	1	8
595	 You call me boy again.	52	1	8
596	 Go on.	52	1	8
597	 Oi.	52	1	8
598	 It is also the wish of His Grace	52	1	8
599	 that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,	52	1	8
600	 - Commander of the City Watch... - Ser Aron.	52	1	8
601	 ...Be at once raised to the rank of Lord...	52	1	8
602	 - Lord Gyles. - ...And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal,	52	1	8
603	 and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor	52	1	8
604	 after him until the end of time.	53	1	8
605	 In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark,	53	1	8
606	 it is the wish of his Grace that Tywin Lannister,	53	1	8
607	 Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West,	53	1	8
608	 be appointed Hand of the King.	53	1	8
609	 Lastly,	53	1	8
610	 in these times of treason and turmoil,	53	1	8
611	 it is the view of the Council	53	1	8
612	 that the life and safety	53	1	8
613	 of King Joffrey	53	1	8
614	 be of paramount importance.	53	1	8
615	 Ser Barristan Selmy.	53	1	8
616	 Your Grace, I am yours to command.	53	1	8
617	 Rise, Ser Barristan.	53	1	8
618	 You may remove your helm.	54	1	8
619	 You have served the Realm long and faithfully.	54	1	8
620	 Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.	54	1	8
621	 But it is time to put aside your armor and your sword.	54	1	8
622	 It is time to rest and look back with pride	54	1	8
623	 on your many years of service.	54	1	8
624	 Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.	54	1	8
625	 Our vows are taken for life.	54	1	8
626	 Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.	54	1	8
627	 Whose death, Ser Barristan? Yours or your King's?	54	1	8
628	 You let my father die.	54	1	8
629	 You're too old to protect anybody.	54	1	8
630	 - Your Grace-- - The Council has determined	54	1	8
631	 that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place	54	1	8
632	 as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.	54	1	8
633	 The man who profaned his blade	54	1	8
634	 with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend!	54	1	8
635	 Careful, Ser.	54	1	8
636	 We have nothing but gratitude	55	1	8
637	 for your long service, good Ser.	55	1	8
638	 You shall be given a stout Keep beside the sea,	55	1	8
639	 with servants to look after your every need.	55	1	8
640	 A hall to die in	55	1	8
641	 and men to bury me.	55	1	8
642	 I am a Knight.	55	1	8
643	 I shall die a Knight.	55	1	8
644	 A naked Knight, apparently.	55	1	8
645	 Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!	55	1	8
646	 Here, boy!	55	1	8
647	 Melt it down and add it to the others.	55	1	8
648	 If any man in this hall has other matters	56	1	8
649	 to set before His Grace, let him speak now	56	1	8
650	 or go forth and hold his silence.	56	1	8
651	 Your Grace.	56	1	8
652	 Come forward, My Lady.	56	1	8
653	 The Lady Sansa of House Stark.	56	1	8
654	 Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?	56	1	8
655	 I do.	56	1	8
656	 As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father,	56	1	8
657	 Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.	56	1	8
658	 Treason is a noxious weed.	56	1	8
659	 - It should be torn out, root-- - Let her speak.	56	1	8
660	 I want to hear what she says.	56	1	8
661	 Thank you, Your Grace.	57	1	8
662	 Do you deny your father's crime?	57	1	8
663	 No, My Lords. I know he must be punished.	57	1	8
664	 All I ask is mercy.	57	1	8
665	 I know My Lord father must regret what he did.	57	1	8
666	 He was King Robert's friend and he loved him.	57	1	8
667	 You all know he loved him.	57	1	8
668	 He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him.	57	1	8
669	 They must have lied to him-- Lord Renly or Lord Stannis	57	1	8
670	 or somebody. They must have lied!	57	1	8
671	 He said I wasn't the King.	57	1	8
672	 Why did he say that?	57	1	8
673	 He was badly hurt.	57	1	8
674	 Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.	57	1	8
675	 He wasn't himself. Otherwise h never would have said it.	57	1	8
676	 A child's faith... Such sweet innocence.	57	1	8
677	 And yet they say wisdom oft comes	57	1	8
678	 from the mouths of babes.	57	1	8
679	 Treason is treason!	57	1	8
680	 Anything else?	58	1	8
681	 If you still have any affection in your heart for me,	58	1	8
682	 please do me this kindness, Your Grace.	58	1	8
683	 Your sweet words have moved me.	58	1	8
684	 But your father has to confess.	58	1	8
685	 He has to confess and say that I'm the King...	58	1	8
686	 Or there'll be no mercy for him.	58	1	8
687	 He will.	58	1	8

12	 When did they take me?	2	4	4
13	 I was five years old.	2	4	4
14	 You remember your home?	2	4	4
15	 I remember when they rowed us away from shore.	2	4	4
16	 How white the beaches were.	3	4	4
17	 How tall the trees.	3	4	4

95	 What the hell was that?	11	4	4
96	 That was me knocking your ass to the dirt	11	4	4
97	 with your own hand.	11	4	4
98	 You're a rare talent.	11	4	4
99	 When you're fighting cripples, anyway.	11	4	4
100	 You learned to fight like a good little boy.	11	4	4
101	 I'll bet that thrust through the Mad King's back was pretty as a picture.	11	4	4
102	 You want to fight pretty or you want to win?	12	4	4
103	 You talk to my brother this way?	12	4	4
104	 All the time.	12	4	4
105	 He got used to it.	12	4	4
106	 Do you think he did it?	12	4	4
107	 No.	12	4	4
108	 Oh, he hated the little twat, sure.	12	4	4
109	 But who didn't?	12	4	4
110	 And poison's not his style.	12	4	4
111	 Or murder, for that matter.	12	4	4
112	 You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?	12	4	4
113	 You haven't been to see him yet, eh?	12	4	4
114	 We're done for today.	12	4	4
115	 (seagulls calling)	12	4	4
116	 Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?	12	4	4
117	 You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.	12	4	4
118	 Aye.	13	4	4
119	 But only when Lady Arryn demanded	13	4	4
120	 the trial take place that day.	13	4	4
121	 You were his first choice.	13	4	4
122	 He named you for his champion	13	4	4
123	 because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him.	13	4	4
124	 You gonna fight for him now?	13	4	4
125	 To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad.	13	4	4
126	 Four walls. A pot to piss in.	13	4	4
127	 I was chained to a wooden post	13	4	4
128	 covered in my own shit for months.	13	4	4
129	 Is that supposed to make me feel better?	13	4	4
130	 Maybe a bit.	13	4	4
131	 I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.	13	4	4
132	 It's complicated, yes.	13	4	4
133	  So how is our sister?  How do you think?	13	4	4
134	 Her son died in her arms.	14	4	4
135	 Her son?	14	4	4
136	 Don't.	14	4	4
137	 You know what's coming?	14	4	4
138	 My trial for regicide. Yes, I know.	14	4	4
139	 I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty.	14	4	4
140	 I know that one of my three judges	14	4	4
141	 has wished me dead more times than I can count.	14	4	4
142	 And that judge is my father.	14	4	4
143	 As for Cersei,	14	4	4
144	 well, she's probably working on a way	14	4	4
145	 to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed.	14	4	4
146	 Now that you mention it, she did ask.	14	4	4
147	 So, should I turn around and close my eyes?	14	4	4
148	 Depends.	14	4	4
149	 Did you do it?	14	4	4
150	 The Kingslayer brothers.	14	4	4
151	 You like it? I like it.	14	4	4
152	 You're really asking if I killed your son?	15	4	4
153	 Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother?	15	4	4
154	 How can I help you?	15	4	4
155	 Well, you could set me free.	15	4	4
156	 You know I can't.	15	4	4
157	 Then there's really nothing else to say.	15	4	4
158	 What do you want me to do? Kill the guards?	15	4	4
159	 Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart?	15	4	4
160	 I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.	15	4	4
161	 Sorry, I'd forgotten.	15	4	4
162	 I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate.	15	4	4
163	 Inappropriate?	15	4	4
164	 You're accused of killing the king. Freeing you is treason.	15	4	4
165	 Except I didn't do it.	15	4	4
166	 Which is why we're having a trial.	15	4	4
167	 A trial.	15	4	4
168	 If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne,	15	4	4
169	 confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt,	15	4	4
170	 it wouldn't matter to Cersei.	15	4	4
171	 She won't rest until my head's on a spike.	15	4	4
172	 Not just yours.	15	4	4
173	 She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.	16	4	4
174	 Sansa couldn't have done this.	16	4	4
175	 She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms.	16	4	4
176	 Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?	16	4	4
177	 No, but...	16	4	4
178	 Sansa's not a killer.	16	4	4
179	 Not yet, anyway.	16	4	4
180	   (wood creaking)   (men shouting)	16	4	4
181	 (footsteps approaching)	16	4	4
182	 Where are you taking me?	16	4	4
183	 I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa.	16	4	4
184	 She's waiting for us at the Eyrie.	16	4	4
185	 You'll be safe there.	16	4	4
186	 Did you kill Joffrey?	17	4	4
187	 Did I kill Joffrey?	17	4	4
188	 I've been in the Vale for weeks.	17	4	4
189	 I know it was you.	17	4	4
190	 And who helped me with this conspiracy?	17	4	4
191	 Well, there was Ser Dontos.	17	4	4
192	 You used him to get me out of King's Landing,	17	4	4
193	 but you would never trust him to kill the king.	17	4	4
194	  Why not?  Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.	17	4	4
195	 Then perhaps it was your husband.	17	4	4
196	 No.	17	4	4
197	 How do you know?	17	4	4
198	 I just do.	17	4	4
199	 You're right.	17	4	4
200	 He wasn't involved in Joffrey's death.	17	4	4
201	 But you were.	17	4	4
202	 Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you?	17	4	4
203	 I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing	17	4	4
204	 after the feast.	17	4	4
205	 The poison.	17	4	4
206	 I don't understand.	18	4	4
207	 The Lannisters gave you wealth, power.	18	4	4
208	 Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal.	18	4	4
209	 A man with no motive is a man no one suspects.	18	4	4
210	 Always keep your foes confused.	18	4	4
211	 If they don't know who you are or what you want,	18	4	4
212	 they can't know what you plan to do next.	18	4	4
213	 I don't believe you.	18	4	4
214	 If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike	18	4	4
215	 just like my father's.	18	4	4
216	 You'd risk that just to confuse them?	18	4	4
217	 So many men, they risk so little.	18	4	4
218	 They spend their lives avoiding danger.	18	4	4
219	 And then they die.	18	4	4
220	 I'd risk everything to get what I want.	18	4	4
221	 And what do you want?	18	4	4
222	 Everything.	19	4	4
223	 My friendship with the Lannisters was productive.	19	4	4
224	 But Joffrey,	19	4	4
225	 a vicious boy with a crown on his head,	19	4	4
226	 is not a reliable ally.	19	4	4
227	 And who could trust a friend like that?	19	4	4
228	 Who could trust you?	19	4	4
229	 I don't want friends like me.	19	4	4
230	 My new friends are predictable.	19	4	4
231	 Very reasonable people.	19	4	4
232	 As for what happened to Joffrey,	19	4	4
233	 well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly.	19	4	4
234	 Nothing like a thoughtful gift	19	4	4
235	 to make a new friendship grow strong.	19	4	4
236	 I can't believe you're going.	19	4	4
237	 Leaving me alone here with these people.	19	4	4
238	 The time has come, my dear.	19	4	4
239	 There's nothing more tedious than a trial.	19	4	4
240	 Except perhaps these gardens.	19	4	4
241	 If I have to take one more leisurely stroll	20	4	4
242	 through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs.	20	4	4
243	 (Margaery laughs)	20	4	4
244	 Have you been to see Tommen yet?	20	4	4
245	 No.	20	4	4
246	 Have they even agreed to the match?	20	4	4
247	 No one tells me anything.	20	4	4
248	 I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know.	20	4	4
249	 He was engaged to my sister,	20	4	4
250	 your great-aunt Viola.	20	4	4
251	 I was to be given to some Targaryen or other.	20	4	4
252	 Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then.	20	4	4
253	 But the moment I saw my intended,	20	4	4
254	 with his twitchy little ferret's face	20	4	4
255	 and ludicrous silver hair,	20	4	4
256	 I knew he wouldn't do.	20	4	4
257	 So the evening	20	4	4
258	 before Luthor was to propose to my sister,	20	4	4
259	 I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson	20	4	4
260	 and happened upon his chamber.	20	4	4
261	 (laughs)	20	4	4
262	  How absent-minded of me.  Mm-mmh.	20	4	4
263	 The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs	21	4	4
264	 to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk.	21	4	4
265	 And once he could, the only thing he wanted	21	4	4
266	 was what I'd given him the night before.	21	4	4
267	 I was good.	21	4	4
268	 I was very, very good.	21	4	4
269	 You are even better.	21	4	4
270	 But you need to act quickly.	21	4	4
271	 Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid.	21	4	4
272	 She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can.	21	4	4
273	 And by the time you're married, it'll be too late.	21	4	4
274	 Luckily for you, the Queen Regent	21	4	4
275	 is rather distracted at the moment,	21	4	4
276	 mourning her dear departed boy.	21	4	4
277	 Accusing her brother of his murder,	21	4	4
278	 which he didn't commit.	21	4	4
279	 Well, he could have done.	21	4	4
280	 He could have done, but he didn't.	21	4	4
281	  You don't know, Grandmother.  But I do know.	21	4	4
282	 You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?	21	4	4
283	 What? I don't understand.	22	4	4
284	 Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that.	22	4	4
285	 You just do what needs to be done.	22	4	4
286	  Bring it through!	22	4	4
287	 (swords clanging)	22	4	4
288	 And again.	22	4	4
289	  (laughs)  Very nice. Good.	22	4	4
290	 A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand.	22	4	4
291	 First thing you want to do	22	4	4
292	 is disarm them to try and even the odds.	22	4	4
293	 Let's see what you can do.	23	4	4
294	 Olly, you just watch for now.	23	4	4
295	 I can fight.	23	4	4
296	 Have you ever held a sword before?	23	4	4
297	 I was the best archer in our hamlet.	23	4	4
298	  (men laugh)  I was!	23	4	4
299	 I believe you.	23	4	4
300	 We'll go hunting for rabbits one day.	23	4	4
301	 Right now, watch and learn.	23	4	4
302	 You two.	23	4	4
303	 Take it slow, try and disarm each other.	23	4	4
304	 (shouts)	23	4	4
305	 (groans)	23	4	4
306	 You know how to fight.	24	4	4
307	 You could have gone easier on him.	24	4	4
308	 He wouldn't have learned anything that way.	24	4	4
309	  Lord Snow.	24	4	4
310	 What do you think you're doing?	24	4	4
311	 Grenn and I were helping them.	24	4	4
312	 Grenn's a ranger. You're a steward.	24	4	4
313	 Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch,	24	4	4
314	 but I didn't.	24	4	4
315	 Someone has to train them.	24	4	4
316	 And that someone isn't you.	24	4	4
317	 Go find a chamber pot to empty.	24	4	4
318	 Go on. Do it.	24	4	4
319	 You traitor's bastard.	24	4	4
320	 Give me an excuse.	24	4	4
321	 Mormont's not here to protect you now.	24	4	4
322	 Get back to work.	24	4	4
323	 Now!	25	4	4
324	 I said now!	25	4	4
325	 The bastard's well-liked. You're not.	25	4	4
326	 You think I care if they like me? We're at war.	25	4	4
327	 For now.	25	4	4
328	 But you can't be acting commander forever.	25	4	4
329	 There will be a choosing.	25	4	4
330	 The old maester will insist on it.	25	4	4
331	 You might reconsider	25	4	4
332	 his request to march on Craster's.	25	4	4
333	 Let the mutineers take care of Snow.	25	4	4
334	 Or you might be taking orders from him	25	4	4
335	 the rest of your life.	25	4	4
336	 A bastard, eh?	25	4	4
337	 Took you for highborn.	25	4	4
338	 My father was highborn.	26	4	4
339	 My mother wasn't.	26	4	4
340	 Name's Locke.	26	4	4
341	 Jon Snow.	26	4	4
342	 You fight well.	26	4	4
343	 What brought you up here?	26	4	4
344	 A sense of duty.	26	4	4
345	 I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm.	26	4	4
346	 (laughs)	26	4	4
347	 I was a game warden in the Stormlands.	26	4	4
348	 Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids.	26	4	4
349	 I was stupid enough to get caught.	26	4	4
350	 Chose the Wall over losing my hand.	26	4	4
351	 Figured I wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn cunts here.	26	4	4
352	  Come on, get on with it.	26	4	4
353	 What are you waiting for? Summer?	26	4	4
354	 Guess I was wrong.	26	4	4
355	 (knocking)	26	4	4
356	 (knocking)	26	4	4
357	 (knocking)	27	4	4
358	 You sent for me, Your Grace?	27	4	4
359	 Your Grace.	27	4	4
360	 How formal of you.	27	4	4
361	 How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?	27	4	4
362	 Ser Boros is on duty tonight.	27	4	4
363	  Tomorrow I believe   So one?	27	4	4
364	 You have one man guarding the future king?	27	4	4
365	 I promise you Tommen's safe.	27	4	4
366	 We're protecting him.	27	4	4
367	 The way you protected Joffrey?	27	4	4
368	 Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?	27	4	4
369	  What?  I've been wondering for months.	27	4	4
370	 Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital.	27	4	4
371	 Why did she set you free?	27	4	4
372	 You know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.	27	4	4
373	 She hoped or did you promise?	28	4	4
374	 I swore by all the gods	28	4	4
375	 that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her.	28	4	4
376	 So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.	28	4	4
377	 I wanted to get back to you.	28	4	4
378	 Should I have told her to fuck off?	28	4	4
379	 You didn't mean it, then?	28	4	4
380	 You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?	28	4	4
381	 Catelyn Stark's dead.	28	4	4
382	 So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa,	28	4	4
383	 if I told you to find that murderous little bitch	28	4	4
384	 and bring me her head,	28	4	4
385	 would you do it?	28	4	4
386	 I know you went to see Tyrion.	28	4	4
387	 That creature who murdered our son.	28	4	4
388	 I had to see him.	28	4	4
389	 I had to know for myself.	28	4	4
390	 And?	29	4	4
391	 He didn't do it, Cersei.	29	4	4
392	 You've always pitied him.	29	4	4
393	 Our poor little brother.	29	4	4
394	 Abused by the world.	29	4	4
395	 Despised by his father and sister.	29	4	4
396	 He'd kill us all if he could.	29	4	4
397	 I want four men at Tommen's door day and night.	29	4	4
398	 That will be all, Lord Commander.	29	4	4
399	 (sighs)	30	4	4
400	 (door opens)	30	4	4
401	 Ser Pounce?	30	4	4
402	 (door creaks)	30	4	4
403	 (door closes)	30	4	4
404	 How did you get past the Kingsguard?	30	4	4
405	 Kingsguard.	30	4	4
406	 I don't think you're supposed to be here.	30	4	4
407	 Mother doesn't allow me to have visitors at night.	30	4	4
408	 I'm not a visitor, Your Grace.	30	4	4
409	 Word has it I'm to be your bride.	30	4	4
410	 Did you know that people in arranged marriages	30	4	4
411	 often never meet until their wedding day?	30	4	4
412	 Before we decide to spend our lives together,	31	4	4
413	 we ought to get to know one another.	31	4	4
414	 Don't you think?	31	4	4
415	 Yes.	31	4	4
416	 But if my mother found out	31	4	4
417	 It can be our secret. Hmm?	31	4	4
418	 If we're going to be man and wife,	31	4	4
419	 we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope.	31	4	4
420	 So, Your Grace...	31	4	4
421	 Yes?	31	4	4
422	 Tell me a secret.	31	4	4
423	  (cat meows)  (laughs)	31	4	4
424	 Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow?	31	4	4
425	 That's Ser Pounce.	31	4	4
426	 Very handsome.	31	4	4
427	 Joffrey didn't like him.	31	4	4
428	 He threatened to skin him alive	31	4	4
429	 and mix his innards up in my food	32	4	4
430	 so I wouldn't know I was eating him.	32	4	4
431	 That's very cruel.	32	4	4
432	 You don't strike me as cruel.	32	4	4
433	 No.	32	4	4
434	 I don't think I am.	32	4	4
435	 That's a relief.	32	4	4
436	 Because you know what happens when we marry?	32	4	4
437	 We say our vows in front of the high septon.	32	4	4
438	 And after the ceremony, there's a feast.	32	4	4
439	 When we marry, I become yours.	32	4	4
440	 Forever.	32	4	4
441	 It's getting late.	32	4	4
442	 (sighs)	32	4	4
443	 I should go.	32	4	4
444	 May I come and visit you again?	32	4	4
445	 (laughs) All right, then.	32	4	4
446	 Remember,	32	4	4
447	 our little secret.	32	4	4
448	 (door closes)	33	4	4
449	  Ser Jaime Lannister.	33	4	4
450	 Knighted and named to the Kingsguard in his 16th year.	33	4	4
451	 At the sack of King's Landing,	33	4	4
452	 murdered his king Aerys II.	33	4	4
453	 Pardoned by Robert Baratheon.	33	4	4
454	 Thereafter known as the Kingslayer.	33	4	4
455	 It's the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages.	33	4	4
456	 And there's still room left on mine.	34	4	4
457	 Valyrian steel.	34	4	4
458	 Mmm.	34	4	4
459	 It's yours.	34	4	4
460	 I can't accept this.	34	4	4
461	 It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword.	34	4	4
462	 You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter.	34	4	4
463	 You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother.	34	4	4
464	 Lady Stark's dead.	35	4	4
465	 Arya's probably dead, too,	35	4	4
466	 but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe.	35	4	4
467	 I've got something else for you.	35	4	4
468	 I hope I got your measurements right.	35	4	4
469	 I'll find her.	35	4	4
470	 For Lady Catelyn.	35	4	4
471	 And for you.	35	4	4
472	 I almost forgot.	35	4	4
473	 I have one more gift.	36	4	4
474	 I don't need a squire.	36	4	4
475	 Of course you do.	36	4	4
476	 He'll slow me down.	36	4	4
477	 My brother owes him a debt. He's not safe here.	36	4	4
478	 You're keeping him from harm. It's chivalry.	36	4	4
479	 I won't slow you down, ser	36	4	4
480	 my lady.	36	4	4
481	 I promise I'll serve you well.	36	4	4
482	 See? He's a good lad. You'll get along.	36	4	4
483	 Compliments of Lord Tyrion.	36	4	4
484	 His axe from the Blackwater.	36	4	4
485	 What are you waiting for, a kiss?	36	4	4
486	 Ready the lady's horse.	36	4	4
487	 They say the best swords have names.	37	4	4
488	 Any ideas?	37	4	4
489	 Oathkeeper.	37	4	4
490	 Good-bye, Brienne.	37	4	4
491	  Come on, move.	38	4	4
492	 I should never have taken her away.	38	4	4
493	  She wasn't safe here.  She's not safe out there.	38	4	4
494	 I should have known.	38	4	4
495	 You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall.	38	4	4
496	 If they're raiding the smaller villages, Mole's Town could be next.	38	4	4
497	  Castle Black could be next.  I should go back for Gilly.	38	4	4
498	 We have orders. No one's to leave the castle.	38	4	4
499	 I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb.	38	4	4
500	 And I remember who came after me and brought me home.	38	4	4
501	 I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me.	38	4	4
502	 When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall,	39	4	4
503	 all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him.	39	4	4
504	 I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me.	39	4	4
505	 I tried. Really, I did.	39	4	4
506	 How fast could they travel?	39	4	4
507	 A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?	39	4	4
508	 I don't know.	39	4	4
509	 They'd pass wildling villages.	39	4	4
510	 They could try to find shelter at one of them.	39	4	4
511	 The wildlings have joined up with Mance.	39	4	4
512	 Every village or sheltered place will be deserted.	39	4	4
513	 Except...	39	4	4
514	  Craster's?	39	4	4
515	 You think Bran might have found	39	4	4
516	 Snow.	39	4	4
517	 I don't mean to interrupt.	39	4	4
518	 Thorne wants to see you.	40	4	4
519	 Your foray to Craster's Keep,	40	4	4
520	 I'll sanction it.	40	4	4
521	 But I won't order anyone to go with you.	40	4	4
522	 Volunteers only.	40	4	4
523	 Thank you, Ser Alliser.	40	4	4
524	 (men chatting)	40	4	4
525	 Ahem, brothers.	40	4	4
526	 (chatter continues)	40	4	4
527	 (pounds)	40	4	4
528	 I'm going beyond the Wall to Craster's Keep.	40	4	4
529	 I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them.	40	4	4
530	 I'm asking for volunteers to come with me.	40	4	4
531	 There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's	41	4	4
532	 and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us,	41	4	4
533	 but we have to do this.	41	4	4
534	 Our survival may depend on	41	4	4
535	 us getting to these mutineers before Mance does.	41	4	4
536	 They know the Wall. They know our defenses.	41	4	4
537	 If Mance learns what they know, we're lost.	41	4	4
538	 But if that's not enough,	41	4	4
539	 then consider this.	41	4	4
540	 If the Night's Watch are truly brothers,	41	4	4
541	 then Lord Commander Mormont was our father.	41	4	4
542	 He lived and died for the Watch	41	4	4
543	 and he was betrayed by his own men.	41	4	4
544	 Stabbed in the back by cowards.	41	4	4
545	 He deserved far better.	41	4	4
546	 All we can give him now is justice.	41	4	4
547	 Who will join me?	41	4	4
548	 I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.	42	4	4
549	 Then let me say my vows.	42	4	4
550	 If it's a fight you're heading for, then you need men who know how.	42	4	4
551	 Thank you, brothers.	43	4	4
552	 (women whimpering)	43	4	4
553	  No, don't.	43	4	4
554	 Don't, please.	43	4	4
555	 Woman #2: Please don't. Ow!	43	4	4
556	 You're hurting me.	43	4	4
557	 Karl Tanner from Gin Alley	43	4	4
558	 drinking wine from the skull	43	4	4
559	 of Jeor fucking Mormont.	43	4	4
560	 Any command for us, Lord Commander?	43	4	4
561	 What's that?	44	4	4
562	 Fuck 'em till they're dead?	44	4	4
563	  (whimpers)   Did you hear that, boys?	44	4	4
564	 Fuck 'em till they're dead.	44	4	4
565	 Rast.	44	4	4
566	 Go outside and feed the beast.	44	4	4
567	 We should kill that thing.	44	4	4
568	 You should shut your fucking hole,	44	4	4
569	 ugly little cunt.	44	4	4
570	 You look like a fucking ballsack.	44	4	4
571	 Ugly. Look at your stupid cunt face.	44	4	4
572	 I could piss in any gutter and soak five of you.	44	4	4
573	 Know how much they paid me to kill a man in King's Landing?	44	4	4
574	 Seven silvers.	44	4	4
575	 They told me a man's name and that man never saw daylight again.	45	4	4
576	 None of them cocksuckers got away from me.	45	4	4
577	 Haven't lost a fight since I was nine.	45	4	4
578	 Maybe it's time.	45	4	4
579	 What do you think, eh?	45	4	4
580	 Maybe you're the man.	45	4	4
581	 Eh, cunt?	45	4	4
582	 I wouldn't stand a chance.	45	4	4
583	 None of us would.	45	4	4
584	 I was a fucking legend in Gin Alley.	45	4	4
585	 A fucking legend!	45	4	4
586	 I would take any knight	45	4	4
587	 any knight, any time.	45	4	4
588	 Fucking cunts in steel plate. Fucking cowards.	45	4	4
589	 (baby fussing)	45	4	4
590	  A gift for the gods.  A gift for the gods.	46	4	4
591	 A gift for the gods.	46	4	4
592	 What the fuck is that?	46	4	4
593	 Craster's last child. A boy.	46	4	4
594	 What am I supposed to do with him?	46	4	4
595	 What did Craster do with 'em?	46	4	4
596	 Kill 'em before they could grow up and do the same to him?	46	4	4
597	 All right.	46	4	4
598	 Don't need another mouth to feed.	46	4	4
599	  Hand him over.  He didn't kill them.	46	4	4
600	  He offered them.  To who?	46	4	4
601	 To the gods.	46	4	4
602	 The white walkers.	46	4	4
603	   A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.	46	4	4
604	 A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.	46	4	4
605	 A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.	46	4	4
606	 Shut up!	46	4	4
607	 So...	46	4	4
608	 if it worked for him...	47	4	4
609	 (crying)	47	4	4
610	 Let's give the walkers what they want.	47	4	4
611	 (baby crying)	47	4	4
612	 Rast is headed that way.	47	4	4
613	 (baby fussing)	47	4	4
614	 (crying)	48	4	4
615	 (loud breathing)	48	4	4
616	 (growling)	48	4	4
617	 Pink-eyed fuck.	48	4	4
618	 You thirsty?	49	4	4
619	 (growls)	49	4	4
620	  (growls)  Fuck!	49	4	4
621	 (crows cawing)	49	4	4
622	 (wind howling)	49	4	4
623	 (ice crackling)	49	4	4
624	 (barks)	49	4	4
625	 (baby crying)	50	4	4
626	 Hodor.	50	4	4
627	 Do you hear that?	50	4	4
628	 Is that a baby?	50	4	4
629	 It's coming.	50	4	4
630	 I'm going out there.	50	4	4
631	 No, we need to stay together.	50	4	4
632	 I'm going.	50	4	4
633	 (whines)	50	4	4
634	 (baby crying)	50	4	4
635	 (wolf howling)	51	4	4
636	 (growls)	51	4	4
637	  Bran. Bran.  Hodor. Hodor.	51	4	4
638	  Hodor.  Bran, what happened?	51	4	4
639	 Summer, he's hurt. They've caught him in a trap.	51	4	4
640	 Who?	51	4	4
641	 I didn't see, but they have my brother's wolf.	51	4	4
642	 They have Ghost.	51	4	4
643	  They're Night's Watch.	51	4	4
644	 Look.	51	4	4
645	 Jon might be here.	51	4	4
646	 If Jon was here, why would they put his wolf in a cage?	51	4	4
647	 (woman whimpering)	51	4	4
648	 (men shouting)	51	4	4
649	 They might have been Night's Watch once, not anymore.	51	4	4
650	 We're not safe here. We need to go.	52	4	4
651	 No.	52	4	4
652	 Bran, we need to go now.	52	4	4
653	 I'm not leaving without Summer.	52	4	4
654	 Can you remember where the cage was?	52	4	4
655	 The east side of the keep.	52	4	4
656	 If I'm not back soon, we'll meet	52	4	4
657	 Hodor.	52	4	4
658	 (shouting)	52	4	4
659	 Hodor.	52	4	4
660	 Hodor. Hodor.	52	4	4
661	 (groans)	52	4	4
662	 Hodor.	52	4	4
663	 If I was your size, I'd be king of the fucking world.	52	4	4
664	 (men laughing)	53	4	4
665	 Help him up.	53	4	4
666	 This is nice.	53	4	4
667	 Fine leather.	53	4	4
668	 You're no wildling.	53	4	4
669	 Important. Highborn.	53	4	4
670	 Who are you?	53	4	4
671	 (grunts)	54	4	4
672	 You see, where I come from,	54	4	4
673	 a commoner like me slaps a little lord like you,	54	4	4
674	 I'd lose my right hand.	54	4	4
675	 But we're a long way from home, aren't we?	54	4	4
676	 And the two of you,	54	4	4
677	 fancy-looking folks north of the Wall	54	4	4
678	 creeping through the woods.	54	4	4
679	 Isn't that a bit odd?	54	4	4
680	 I like your curly hair.	54	4	4
681	 My mom had curls like that.	54	4	4
682	 Beautiful brown curls.	54	4	4
683	 Why'd you drag a crippled boy all the way up here?	54	4	4
684	 See you haven't played this game before.	54	4	4
685	 A highborn hostage,	55	4	4
686	 that's valuable.	55	4	4
687	 But three of them,	55	4	4
688	 that's a lot of mouths to feed.	55	4	4
689	   What the fuck's wrong with him?  Come here.	55	4	4
690	 (screams) No, please.	55	4	4
691	 Please. Please, let me help him.	55	4	4
692	  Who are you?  Please.	55	4	4
693	  Who are you?  I'm Brandon Stark!	55	4	4
694	 I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.	55	4	4
695	 It's Jon Snow's brother.	55	4	4
696	 It's Meera. It's Meera. I'm right here.	55	4	4
697	 And I thought this was gonna be another boring day.	55	4	4
698	  I'm right here.	55	4	4
699	 (wind howling)	55	4	4
700	 (ice crackling)	57	4	4

0	 1 Did you kill Joffrey?	0	5	7
1	 It was something my new friends wanted very badly.	0	5	7
2	 You didn't think I'd let you marry that beast, did you?	0	5	7
3	 We engaged in intimate relations.	0	5	7
4	 Queen Margaery walked in on us.	0	5	7
5	 There is enough evidence to bring a formal trial	0	5	7
6	 for Ser Loras and Queen Margaery. Take her.	0	5	7
7	 - Lancel Lannister. - Brother Lannister.	0	5	7
8	 - We abandon our family names. - Quite a family to abandon.	0	5	7
9	 To forge a lasting bond with the people,	0	5	7
10	 I will marry the leader of an ancient family	0	5	7
11	 and reopen the fighting pits.	0	5	7
12	 It's a slave ship.	0	5	7
13	 Take me to Slaver's Bay, put a sword in my hand,	0	5	7
14	 I will prove my worth.	0	5	7
15	 I want you to be my wife.	0	5	7
16	 We have to go, Myrcella. Now.	0	5	7
17	 Drop your weapons.	0	5	7
18	 We're going to have a baby.	0	5	7
19	 From the way she's carrying, it looks like a boy.	0	5	7
20	 Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.	1	5	7
21	 Sansa is in danger, even if she doesn't realize it.	1	5	7
22	 If you're ever in trouble,	1	5	7
23	 light a candle in the highest window of the Broken Tower.	1	5	7
24	 Will you take this man?	1	5	7
25	 I take this man.	1	5	7
26	 You've known Sansa since she was a girl.	1	5	7
27	 Now watch her become a woman.	1	5	7
28	 I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it.	1	5	7
29	 I shall mount Roose Bolton's head on a spike.	1	5	7
30	 - The Queen and the Princess? - They're coming with us.	1	5	7
31	 We march at sunrise.	1	5	7
32	 And if you go north of the Wall,	1	5	7
33	 gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them here.	1	5	7
34	 I'll open the gates and let them through.	1	5	7
35	 Make peace to save your people.	1	5	7
36	 You're coming with me.	1	5	7
37		3	5	7
38	 First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black.	4	5	7
39	 Lord Commander, it is my duty to tell you	4	5	7
40	 I believe this mission to be reckless, foolhardy,	4	5	7
41	 and an insult to all the brothers	4	5	7
42	 who have died fighting the wildlings.	4	5	7
43	 As always, thank you for your honesty.	4	5	7
44	 Safe travels, Lord Commander.	5	5	7
45	 Thank you, Sam.	5	5	7
46	 Oh, um...	5	5	7
47	 It's dragonglass.	5	5	7
48	 It's what I used to kill the white walker.	5	5	7
49	 I hope you don't need them.	5	5	7
50	 Me, too.	5	5	7
51	 Yah.	5	5	7
52	 There he is.	6	5	7
53	 That laugh.	6	5	7
54	 Egg.	6	5	7
55	 Egg laughed like that.	6	5	7
56	 One of the first things I remember.	6	5	7
57	 His little brother Aegon. He became king.	6	5	7
58	 And before that, he was a jolly fellow,	6	5	7
59	 like this one.	6	5	7
60	 Get him south, Gillyflower.	6	5	7
61	 Before it's too late.	6	5	7
62	 Theon, wait.	7	5	7
63	 Not Theon, my lady. Reek.	7	5	7
64	 Help me.	7	5	7
65	 You're his wife now.	7	5	7
66	 Theon.	7	5	7
67	 Do what he says.	7	5	7
68	 Do what he says or he'll hurt you.	7	5	7
69	 He already hurts me every night.	7	5	7
70	 All day I'm locked in this room	8	5	7
71	 and every night he comes...	8	5	7
72	 It can't be any worse.	8	5	7
73	 It can. It can always be worse.	8	5	7
74	 - What did he do to you? - Please.	8	5	7
75	 - You betrayed my family! - I'm sorry! I'm sorry!	8	5	7
76	 You have to help me. Theon, help me.	8	5	7
77	 He'll see us. You don't know him.	8	5	7
78	 My family still has friends in the North.	8	5	7
79	 All I need to do is give a signal and they'll rescue me.	8	5	7
80	 Climb to the top of the broken tower.	8	5	7
81	 Light this candle and put it in the window.	8	5	7
82	 - Promise me, Theon. - Reek! My name is Reek.	8	5	7
83	 Your name is Theon Greyjoy.	8	5	7
84	 Last surviving son of Balon Greyjoy,	8	5	7
85	 Lord of the Iron Islands.	8	5	7
86	 Do you hear me?	8	5	7
87	 Theon...	8	5	7
88	 promise me.	9	5	7
89	 Yes, Reek?	10	5	7
90	 Egg.	10	5	7
91	 Egg.	10	5	7
92	 Mother's looking for you.	10	5	7
93	 Egg.	10	5	7
94	 Get some sleep, Sam.	10	5	7
95	 You'll have to speak for him tomorrow.	10	5	7
96	 You don't know that.	10	5	7
97	 Get some sleep.	10	5	7
98	 I'll watch over him.	10	5	7
99	 I'm staying, too.	10	5	7
100	 He's always been good to me.	10	5	7
101	 I can't leave him now.	11	5	7
102	 Egg!	11	5	7
103	 Egg.	11	5	7
104	 I dreamed...	11	5	7
105	 that I was old.	11	5	7
106	 His name was Aemon Targaryen.	11	5	7
107	 He came to us from King's Landing.	11	5	7
108	 A maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn,	11	5	7
109	 and sworn brother of the Night's Watch, ever faithful.	11	5	7
110	 No man was wiser	11	5	7
111	 or gentler or kinder.	11	5	7
112	 At the Wall, a dozen lord commanders	11	5	7
113	 came and went during his years of service,	12	5	7
114	 but he was always there to counsel them.	12	5	7
115	 He was the blood of the dragon...	12	5	7
116	 but now his fire has gone out.	12	5	7
117	 And now his watch is ended.	12	5	7
118	 And now his watch is ended.	12	5	7
119	 You're losing all your friends, Tarly.	12	5	7
120	 My beautiful wife.	13	5	7
121	 When my father told me we were marrying,	13	5	7
122	 I half expected a fat, bearded beast.	13	5	7
123	 Do you know how pleased I was when I saw you?	13	5	7
124	 You've made me very happy.	13	5	7
125	 Our scouts report that Stannis Baratheon rides for Winterfell.	14	5	7
126	 He's a respected commander.	14	5	7
127	 His troops are loyal and battle-tested.	14	5	7
128	 He's hired thousands of foreign sellswords to bolster his army.	14	5	7
129	 But this storm is a stroke of luck for us northerners.	14	5	7
130	 Our people are used to fighting in the frost.	14	5	7
131	 His army is out there now suffering in the snow.	14	5	7
132	 One day I'll be Lord of Winterfell	14	5	7
133	 and Warden of the North.	14	5	7
134	 You'll be my lady and Wardeness.	14	5	7
135	 But isn't your stepmother pregnant?	14	5	7
136	 What of it?	14	5	7
137	 What happens if she has a boy?	14	5	7
138	 Then I'll have a baby brother.	14	5	7
139	 But he'll be the heir.	14	5	7
140	 I'm Lord Bolton's eldest son.	14	5	7
141	 But you're a bastard.	14	5	7
142	 A trueborn will always have the stronger claim.	14	5	7
143	 I've been naturalized by a royal decree from--	15	5	7
144	 Tommen Baratheon? Another bastard.	15	5	7
145	 Bastards can rise high in the world.	15	5	7
146	 Like your half-brother Jon Snow.	15	5	7
147	 Born the bastard of Winterfell,	15	5	7
148	 now the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.	15	5	7
149	 You didn't know?	15	5	7
150	 Yes, he's done very well for himself.	15	5	7
151	 Oh.	15	5	7
152	 I nearly forgot why I asked you to join me.	15	5	7
153	 Come, my lady.	15	5	7
154	 Your northern friend.	15	5	7
155	 Reek told me you wanted to leave.	15	5	7
156	 Why?	16	5	7
157	 Winterfell is your home	16	5	7
158	 and I am your husband.	16	5	7
159	 Tough old bird.	16	5	7
160	 Everyone talks when I start peeling them.	16	5	7
161	 But this one,	16	5	7
162	 her heart gave out before I even got to her face.	16	5	7
163	 We do breed them tough in the North.	16	5	7
164	 Bring my wife back to her chamber.	16	5	7
165	 It's far too cold out here for a lady.	16	5	7
166	 You should hold on to your candles.	16	5	7
167	 The nights are so long now.	16	5	7
168	 40 horses died in the night.	17	5	7
169	 We'll lose more come sunset.	17	5	7
170	 We're running out of food.	17	5	7
171	 We can't open the supply line until the snow clears.	17	5	7
172	 What else?	17	5	7
173	 The Stormcrows rode off last night.	17	5	7
174	 500 men.	17	5	7
175	 Sellswords.	17	5	7
176	 Loyal to nothing but gold.	17	5	7
177	 We still have a hard march to Winterfell	18	5	7
178	 and we won't be marching anywhere in this weather.	18	5	7
179	 And?	18	5	7
180	 This isn't our time.	18	5	7
181	 We should head back to Castle Black when the snow clears.	18	5	7
182	 I retreated from King's Landing, Ser Davos.	18	5	7
183	 If I retreat again, I'll become the King Who Ran.	18	5	7
184	 - Your Grace-- - Winter is coming.	18	5	7
185	 Those aren't just the Stark words. It's a fact.	18	5	7
186	 If we march back to Castle Black,	18	5	7
187	 we winter at Castle Black.	18	5	7
188	 And who can say how many years	18	5	7
189	 this winter will last?	18	5	7
190	 It's better to wait for the right time than risk everything.	18	5	7
191	 This is the right time and I will risk everything.	18	5	7
192	 Because if I don't, we've lost.	18	5	7
193	 We march to victory	18	5	7
194	 or we march to defeat.	18	5	7
195	 But we go forward. Only forward.	18	5	7
196	 Your Grace.	19	5	7
197	 I've trusted in your visions	19	5	7
198	 and your prophecies for years.	19	5	7
199	 You saw it yourself, my king,	19	5	7
200	 when you stared into the flames.	19	5	7
201	 A great battle in the snow.	19	5	7
202	 - I don't know what I saw. - You do know.	19	5	7
203	 Trust yourself.	19	5	7
204	 And you? Do you trust yourself?	19	5	7
205	 I trust in the Lord.	19	5	7
206	 Are you sure?	19	5	7
207	 I have seen myself walk along the battlements of Winterfell.	19	5	7
208	 I have seen the flayed man banners lowered to the ground.	19	5	7
209	 But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory.	19	5	7
210	 I have shown you the power of king's blood.	20	5	7
211	 The usurper Robb Stark.	20	5	7
212	 The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.	20	5	7
213	 We don't have Robert's bastard here.	20	5	7
214	 No, we have someone better.	20	5	7
215	 And your blood runs through her veins.	20	5	7
216	 Have you lost your mind?	20	5	7
217	 Do you doubt me?	20	5	7
218	 Still?	20	5	7
219	 After all that you've seen.	20	5	7
220	 There must be another way.	20	5	7
221	 - Leeches or-- - There is only one way.	20	5	7
222	 You must become king before the Long Night begins.	20	5	7
223	 Only you can lead the living against the dead.	20	5	7
224	 All your life has led us to this moment.	20	5	7
225	 - To this decision. - She's my daughter.	20	5	7
226	 Get out.	20	5	7
227	 There's always some sort of grub on.	21	5	7
228	 A bit of mutton would be nice.	21	5	7
229	 A beauty from beyond the Wall.	21	5	7
230	 Where you going, love? Aren't we better-looking than the fat man?	21	5	7
231	 No, the question is is she pretty down south in the real world	21	5	7
232	 or is she pretty 'cause she's the only girl here?	21	5	7
233	 Even in White Harbor, I'd want a kiss.	21	5	7
234	 Come on, love, give us a kiss.	21	5	7
235	 - Leave me alone. - Oh, if you were my girl, I wouldn't leave you alone.	21	5	7
236	 - One little kiss. - Come on, give him a kiss.	21	5	7
237	 A man gets lonely guarding the Wall.	21	5	7
238	 There's no need to be rude.	21	5	7
239	 We just want a little affection.	21	5	7
240	 Ooh.	21	5	7
241	 Get your hands off her.	21	5	7
242	 Brother Derek, Brother Brant,	21	5	7
243	 I believe you both have guard duty tonight.	22	5	7
244	 Sam the Slayer.	22	5	7
245	 You gonna slay me with that sword?	22	5	7
246	 Look at his hand shake.	22	5	7
247	 Gilly, go on.	22	5	7
248	 Get back to your room, lock the door.	22	5	7
249	 - I'm warning you. - Come on.	22	5	7
250	 Come on.	22	5	7
251	 Sam!	22	5	7
252	 You lying sack of shit.	22	5	7
253	 Killed a white walker, eh?	22	5	7
254	 You fat-ass fuck.	22	5	7
255	 Come on, get up.	22	5	7
256	 - No! - This your hero? This hog?	22	5	7
257	 Leave him alone!	22	5	7
258	 Stubborn little wildling bitch, aren't you?	22	5	7
259	 - Come on! - No!	22	5	7
260	 - Sam! Sam! Sam! - Come on!	22	5	7
261	 - Sam! Sam! - Come on.	22	5	7
262	 - Right.	23	5	7
263	 I'll deal with this.	23	5	7
264	 - Turn her over. - All right.	23	5	7
265	 I said get your hands off her.	23	5	7
266	 You're gonna get yourself killed.	23	5	7
267	 Your lover Jon Snow's not here to save you.	23	5	7
268	 I killed a white walker, I killed a Thenn.	23	5	7
269	 I'll take my chances with you.	23	5	7
270	 Sam!	23	5	7
271	 - I'm all right. - You're not.	23	5	7
272	 Just a bit woozy.	23	5	7
273	 The next time you see something like that, you leave it alone.	24	5	7
274	 I will not. They would have--	24	5	7
275	 I don't know what they would have done.	24	5	7
276	 I know they would have killed you if Ghost hadn't come.	24	5	7
277	 No. No, no. They were tiring out.	24	5	7
278	 I had them in the palm of my hand.	24	5	7
279	 Don't be stupid, Sam.	24	5	7
280	 You're not a fighter.	24	5	7
281	 What kind of man would I be	24	5	7
282	 if I ran away when I saw someone hurting you?	24	5	7
283	 Just promise me	24	5	7
284	 whatever happens, you'll take care of Little Sam.	24	5	7
285	 But of course I will.	24	5	7
286	 And...	24	5	7
287	 I'll take care of you, too.	24	5	7
288	 I need more water.	25	5	7
289	 Stay.	25	5	7
290	 Please?	25	5	7
291	 Am I hurting you?	26	5	7
292	 Are you sure?	26	5	7
293	 Oh, my!	26	5	7
294	 A rare find for the fighting pits, my friends.	27	5	7
295	 Not your usual street tough or drunken pirate.	27	5	7
296	 This one's a Westerosi knight	27	5	7
297	 from an ancient house trained in sword and lance.	27	5	7
298	 He fought beside the stag king Robert	27	5	7
299	 on the far side of the Narrow Sea.	27	5	7
300	 He was first through the breach during the Siege of Spike,	27	5	7
301	 slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword.	27	5	7
302	 He killed the great Khal Drogo in single combat.	27	5	7
303	 Betrayed by his woman,	27	5	7
304	 he sold himself into slavery to repay his debts.	27	5	7
305	 Bidding begins at 12 gold honors.	27	5	7
306	 13. Do I have 14?	27	5	7
307	 15? 15 gold honors.	27	5	7
308	 Do I hear 16? 16?	27	5	7
309	 20.	27	5	7
310	 Sold.	28	5	7
311	 Wait! You have to buy me as well.	28	5	7
312	 Why?	28	5	7
313	 We're a team.	28	5	7
314	 I'm a great fighter, too.	28	5	7
315	 He's funny. You have to give him that.	28	5	7
316	 You're right, he's funny.	28	5	7
317	 Thank you, my lord. Thank you.	29	5	7
318	 Yes.	29	5	7
319	 My lord, if I may.	29	5	7
320	 I've heard Meereen has become a free city.	29	5	7
321	 You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits.	29	5	7
322	 Now, if you were to fight freed men who'd be paid a wage--	29	5	7
323	 There's your wages, funny man.	29	5	7
324	 Should last the rest of your life.	29	5	7
325	 These are warrior hands, not a serving girl's.	29	5	7
326	 5, going once...	29	5	7
327	 How long before the King of Meereen comes to claim my pillow?	29	5	7
328	 Don't be ridiculous.	29	5	7
329	 My marriage to Hizdahr is political.	29	5	7
330	 I think he's smart enough to understand that.	29	5	7
331	 I think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing	29	5	7
332	 because their leader was made king.	29	5	7
333	 Are you jealous?	29	5	7
334	 You think I'm petty enough to speak ill of a man	30	5	7
335	 just because he represents competition?	30	5	7
336	 I do.	30	5	7
337	 You're right.	30	5	7
338	 My motivations are entirely impure.	30	5	7
339	 Doesn't make me wrong.	30	5	7
340	 You told me yourself I can't fight enemies within and without.	30	5	7
341	 So when enemies without come knocking,	30	5	7
342	 I need the city of Meereen behind me.	30	5	7
343	 I have no choice.	30	5	7
344	 Everyone has a choice.	30	5	7
345	 Even slaves have a choice--	30	5	7
346	 death or slavery.	30	5	7
347	 So what else can I do, hmm?	30	5	7
348	 Marry me instead.	30	5	7
349	 Even if I wanted to do such an inadvisable thing,	30	5	7
350	 I couldn't.	30	5	7
351	 Why not?	30	5	7
352	 You are queen. You can do what you like.	31	5	7
353	 No, I can't.	31	5	7
354	 Then you are the only person in Meereen who's not free.	31	5	7
355	 And I know I'm here to serve my queen and not give advice,	31	5	7
356	 but can I make one more suggestion?	31	5	7
357	 Of course.	31	5	7
358	 On the day of the great games,	31	5	7
359	 gather all the Great Masters and Wise Masters	31	5	7
360	 and Worthy Masters you can find	31	5	7
361	 and slaughter them all.	31	5	7
362	 I am a queen, not a butcher.	31	5	7
363	 All rulers are either butchers or meat.	32	5	7
364	 You there. Where would I find the High Septon	32	5	7
365	 or High Sparrow or whatever bloody fool name he's got?	32	5	7
366	 It's not as good a name as Queen of Thorns, I'll admit.	32	5	7
367	 You should have the decency	32	5	7
368	 to stand when you speak to a lady.	32	5	7
369	 You should have the decency to kneel before the gods.	32	5	7
370	 Don't spar with me, little fellow.	32	5	7
371	 For me, it's the knees.	32	5	7
372	 - You? - Hips.	32	5	7
373	 Ah.	32	5	7
374	 A man of the people. Is that your game?	32	5	7
375	 It's an old game. Dull and unconvincing.	32	5	7
376	 A man of the people	32	5	7
377	 who does Cersei's dirty work for her.	32	5	7
378	 The people always do the dirty work.	32	5	7
379	 Spare me the homilies. I can smell a fraud from a mile away.	33	5	7
380	 Useful talent.	33	5	7
381	 I'm here for my grandson and granddaughter.	33	5	7
382	 Your grandson and granddaughter	33	5	7
383	 swore sacred vows and lied.	33	5	7
384	 The Father judges us all.	33	5	7
385	 Sons of high lords,	33	5	7
386	 sons of fishermen.	33	5	7
387	 If you break his laws, you will be punished.	33	5	7
388	 Don't you walk away from me.	33	5	7
389	 You don't give commands here, Lady Olenna.	33	5	7
390	 What is it you want?	33	5	7
391	 Gold?	33	5	7
392	 I'll make you the richest septon who ever lived.	33	5	7
393	 What, then?	33	5	7
394	 I imagine this is strange for you.	33	5	7
395	 Everyone you meet has a hidden motive	33	5	7
396	 and you pride yourself on sniffing it out.	33	5	7
397	 But I'm telling you a simple truth.	33	5	7
398	 I serve the gods.	33	5	7
399	 The gods demand justice.	33	5	7
400	 How do they communicate their demands?	33	5	7
401	 By raven or horse?	33	5	7
402	" By the holy text, ""The Seven-Pointed Star."""	34	5	7
403	 If you don't have one in your library,	34	5	7
404	 I'll give you my own.	34	5	7
405	" I've read ""The Seven-Pointed Star."""	34	5	7
406	 Then you'll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury.	34	5	7
407	 Your grandchildren will be punished	34	5	7
408	 in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.	34	5	7
409	 Half the men, women, and children	34	5	7
410	 in this foul city break the sacred laws.	34	5	7
411	 You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists,	34	5	7
412	 and yet you punish Loras	34	5	7
413	 for shagging some perfumed ponce	34	5	7
414	 and Margaery for defending her brother?	34	5	7
415	 Yes. The gods' laws must be applied to all equally.	34	5	7
416	 If it's equality you want, so be it.	34	5	7
417	 When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital,	34	5	7
418	 everyone here will starve.	34	5	7
419	 And I'll make sure the hungry know who's to blame.	34	5	7
420	 Have you ever sowed the field, Lady Olenna?	34	5	7
421	 Have you ever reaped the grain?	35	5	7
422	 Has anyone in House Tyrell?	35	5	7
423	 A lifetime of wealth and power	35	5	7
424	 has left you blind in one eye.	35	5	7
425	 You are the few, we are the many.	35	5	7
426	 And when the many stop fearing the few...	35	5	7
427	 Lady Olenna.	35	5	7
428	 Starving yourself won't make things	35	5	7
429	 any better for her, my love.	35	5	7
430	 She's in a prison cell	35	5	7
431	 and there is nothing I can do.	36	5	7
432	 I am the king!	36	5	7
433	 The queen is in prison and there is nothing I can do!	36	5	7
434	 No matter who you are,	36	5	7
435	 no matter how strong you are, sooner or later,	36	5	7
436	 you'll face circumstances beyond your control.	36	5	7
437	 Events you couldn't possibly have anticipated	36	5	7
438	 or prevented even if you had.	36	5	7
439	 You cannot blame yourself for fate.	36	5	7
440	 Your father,	36	5	7
441	 your brother, your grandfather--	36	5	7
442	 I was Queen of the Seven Kingdoms and what could I do?	36	5	7
443	 Hold them as they left this world.	36	5	7
444	 Kissed their heads after they'd gone.	36	5	7
445	 I'll call in the army.	36	5	7
446	 I'll take back the sept	36	5	7
447	 and kill every last one of them.	36	5	7
448	 I'll start a war if I have to.	37	5	7
449	 You know as well as I do who the first casualty of that war would be.	37	5	7
450	 I love her.	37	5	7
451	 I love her...	37	5	7
452	 and I can't help her.	37	5	7
453	 We must be strong for those we love.	37	5	7
454	 We cannot give in to despair.	37	5	7
455	 I will speak with the High Sparrow.	37	5	7
456	 There must be something he--	37	5	7
457	 Let me talk to him on your behalf.	37	5	7
458	 The king cannot sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.	37	5	7
459	 You will try to help her?	37	5	7
460	 I'll do everything I can to win her freedom and her brother's.	38	5	7
461	 Your happiness is all I want in this world.	38	5	7
462	 - I know. - No, you don't.	38	5	7
463	 You can't possibly.	38	5	7
464	 Not until you have children of your own.	38	5	7
465	 I would do anything for you.	38	5	7
466	 Anything to keep you from harm.	38	5	7
467	 I would burn cities to the ground.	38	5	7
468	 You are all that matters.	38	5	7
469	 You and your sister.	38	5	7
470	 From the moment you came into this world.	38	5	7
471	 My boy.	38	5	7
472	 My only boy.	38	5	7
473	 Prince Doran hopes this satisfies	39	5	7
474	 your concerns about the princess's well-being.	39	5	7
475	 You looked different when I left.	39	5	7
476	 You had more hair.	39	5	7
477	 And more hands.	39	5	7
478	 - How's Trystane? - He'll be all right.	39	5	7
479	 I'm sorry for that.	39	5	7
480	 It wasn't supposed to happen that way.	39	5	7
481	 Why is it happening at all?	39	5	7
482	 Your mother's worried about you.	39	5	7
483	 Threats have been made.	39	5	7
484	 Dorne's too dangerous for you.	39	5	7
485	 - I've come to take you home. - This is my home.	39	5	7
486	 This has been my home for years.	39	5	7
487	 I didn't want to come here, but she told me to.	39	5	7
488	 I did what she said.	39	5	7
489	 I did my duty and now she's forcing me to go back?	39	5	7
490	 It's for your own good. These are complicated matters.	39	5	7
491	 No, it's not complicated at all. It's simple.	39	5	7
492	 I love Trystane, I'm going to marry him,	39	5	7
493	 and we're staying right here.	40	5	7
494	 - I don't understand. - Of course you don't.	40	5	7
495	 You don't know me.	40	5	7
496	  Brothers, O brothers, my days here are done 	40	5	7
497	  The Dornishman's taken my life 	40	5	7
498	  But what does it matter 	40	5	7
499	  For all men must die	40	5	7
500	  And I've tasted the Dornishman's wife 	40	5	7
501	  I have, I've tasted the Dornishman's wife. 	40	5	7
502	 He's got a good voice.	40	5	7
503	 We're lucky he's a singer.	40	5	7
504	 If he were a fighter, we might have been in trouble.	40	5	7
505	 It's against my code to hurt a woman.	40	5	7
506	 It's amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code.	40	5	7
507	 I wouldn't say you beat me.	40	5	7
508	 How's your arm?	40	5	7
509	 Wonderful.	40	5	7
510	 Wouldn't feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar.	41	5	7
511	 You think you're leaving Dorne?	41	5	7
512	 No great hurry.	41	5	7
513	 Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world.	41	5	7
514	 Thank you.	41	5	7
515	 I said Dornish women. I didn't say you.	41	5	7
516	 I'm not the most beautiful woman you've ever seen?	41	5	7
517	 I've seen quite a few women	41	5	7
518	 in all the Seven Kingdoms.	41	5	7
519	 Name one more beautiful than I am.	41	5	7
520	 Well, now, in King's Landing,	41	5	7
521	 there was an absolutely gorgeous...	41	5	7
522	 There was a what?	41	5	7
523	 In King's Landing, you were saying?	41	5	7
524	 Was I?	41	5	7
525	 There was a woman more beautiful than I am.	41	5	7
526	 Was there?	41	5	7
527	 My memory's not what it was earlier.	41	5	7
528	 How's your arm now?	42	5	7
529	 You seem concerned with it.	42	5	7
530	 You must really like me.	42	5	7
531	 And how about your head?	42	5	7
532	 My head?	42	5	7
533	 My head?	42	5	7
534	 You don't even want to know what's going on in--	42	5	7
535	 Your nose is bleeding.	42	5	7
536	 It's nothing. It's the dry air.	42	5	7
537	 My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshai.	42	5	7
538	 They call it the Long Farewell.	42	5	7
539	 It takes time to work,	42	5	7
540	 but if a single drop makes contact with the skin,	43	5	7
541	 death.	43	5	7
542	 The only antidote.	43	5	7
543	 Who's the most beautiful woman in the world?	43	5	7
544	 You.	43	5	7
545	 Sorry? Who?	43	5	7
546	 You.	43	5	7
547	 Don't drop it.	43	5	7
548	 I think you're very handsome as well.	43	5	7
549	 - I'm sorry about the locale. - No, you're not.	44	5	7
550	 It felt like the safest place.	44	5	7
551	 Not for your clientele, clearly.	44	5	7
552	 It was an establishment like no other.	44	5	7
553	 The sheer range of appetites catered to.	44	5	7
554	 Desires that didn't even exist	44	5	7
555	 until we invented them.	44	5	7
556	 You've always been rather impressed with yourself, haven't you?	45	5	7
557	 The past is the past.	45	5	7
558	 The future is all that's worth discussing.	45	5	7
559	 The future of House Tyrell.	45	5	7
560	 Don't pretend to have any concern for my house,	45	5	7
561	 my grandchildren or me.	45	5	7
562	 I should have known you'd return to the capital	45	5	7
563	 as soon as things started to go wrong.	45	5	7
564	 - I promise you-- - I promise you, Lord Baelish,	45	5	7
565	 that our fates are joined.	45	5	7
566	 Together we murdered a king.	45	5	7
567	 If my house should fall, I will have nothing to hide.	45	5	7
568	 And if I should meet with some accident	45	5	7
569	 here at your broken little flesh market,	45	5	7
570	 they'll never even find what's left of you.	45	5	7
571	 So...	45	5	7
572	 do you deny a part in all this?	45	5	7
573	 Cersei summoned me to King's Landing.	45	5	7
574	 I dared not refuse her.	45	5	7
575	 And what did she want?	45	5	7
576	 A piece of information she knew that I had.	45	5	7
577	 Neither silence nor lies were an option.	46	5	7
578	 But I have other information	46	5	7
579	 of which she is unaware.	46	5	7
580	 And as you say, our interests are aligned.	46	5	7
581	 I have a gift for you.	46	5	7
582	 What kind of gift?	46	5	7
583	 The same kind I gave Cersei.	46	5	7
584	 A handsome young man.	46	5	7
585	 Many worthy fighters have died	46	5	7
586	 trying to make it to the great games.	46	5	7
587	 When most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon,	46	5	7
588	 it will represent a significant rise in your station.	46	5	7
589	 But if you do happen to triumph here,	46	5	7
590	 you will fight at the Great Pit of Daznak itself	46	5	7
591	 in front of the queen.	46	5	7
592	 So whatever happens, the gods have smiled upon you today.	46	5	7
593	 This is the day your lives actually start to mean something.	47	5	7
594	 You and you. You.	47	5	7
595	 You two.	47	5	7
596	 You, you, and you.	47	5	7
597	 Up.	47	5	7
598	 - Valar morghulis. - Valar dohaeris.	47	5	7
599	 Prepare yourselves.	47	5	7
600	 Sitting through the great games will be bad enough.	47	5	7
601	 For generations in the days leading up to the great games,	47	5	7
602	 it has been customary for our ruler	47	5	7
603	 to make the rounds of the lower pits	47	5	7
604	 to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence.	47	5	7
605	 Move yourselves.	47	5	7
606	 Your Grace.	48	5	7
607	 Your future Grace.	48	5	7
608	 You honor us all.	48	5	7
609	 Stand there.	48	5	7
610	 Stand straight. That's the fucking queen.	48	5	7
611	 We fight and die for your glory,	48	5	7
612	 O glorious queen.	48	5	7
613	 We fight and die for your glory,	48	5	7
614	 O glorious queen.	48	5	7
615	 Fight!	48	5	7
616	 I think I've seen enough.	49	5	7
617	 Your Grace, it is a tradition	49	5	7
618	 for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged.	49	5	7
619	 I've sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.	49	5	7
620	 What are you doing?	49	5	7
621	 Wait your turn, you piece of fucking filth.	49	5	7
622	 Get him out of my sight.	51	5	7
623	 Khaleesi, please.	51	5	7
624	 I just need a moment of your time.	51	5	7
625	 I brought you a gift.	51	5	7
626	 It's true.	51	5	7
627	 He has.	51	5	7
628	 Who are you?	51	5	7
629	 I am the gift.	51	5	7
630	 It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace.	51	5	7
631	 My name is Tyrion Lannister.	51	5	7
632	 This is horrible.	52	5	7
633	 Unacceptable.	52	5	7
634	 Are they feeding you enough at least?	52	5	7
635	 I brought you this. Venison.	52	5	7
636	 It's quite good.	52	5	7
637	 I had it myself for supper only last night.	52	5	7
638	 We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother.	52	5	7
639	 Tommen even went to the sept himself	52	5	7
640	 to confront the High Sparrow.	52	5	7
641	 But I fear the Faith has left reason behind.	53	5	7
642	 I know you did this.	53	5	7
643	 We are making every effort on your behalf.	53	5	7
644	 I swear to you by all the seven gods.	53	5	7
645	 Lies come easily to you.	53	5	7
646	 Everyone knows that.	53	5	7
647	 But innocence,	53	5	7
648	 decency, concern,	53	5	7
649	 you're not very good at those, I'm afraid.	53	5	7
650	 Perhaps that's why your son was so eager	53	5	7
651	 to cast you aside for me.	53	5	7
652	 You're upset.	53	5	7
653	 You're not thinking clearly.	53	5	7
654	 I'll visit again when you've had a chance to calm down.	53	5	7
655	 I don't want to see you again.	53	5	7
656	 I do hope you change your mind about that.	53	5	7
657	 I've been told men often go mad	53	5	7
658	 in the Black Cells beneath the Red Keep.	53	5	7
659	 Though I suppose your isolation will end	53	5	7
660	 when your trial begins.	53	5	7
661	 Leave.	53	5	7
662	 Yes.	53	5	7
663	 I'm afraid I must.	54	5	7
664	 My son needs me now more than ever.	54	5	7
665	 Get out, you hateful bitch!	54	5	7
666	 Sleep well, sister.	54	5	7
667	 Thank you, Boake.	54	5	7
668	 - You saw her? - Yes.	54	5	7
669	 - And? - Her accommodations seem sufficient.	55	5	7
670	 What happens to her now?	55	5	7
671	 Well, she and her brother are both being held	55	5	7
672	 under fair suspicion.	55	5	7
673	 A trial will be held for each of them	55	5	7
674	 to determine if they're guilty of any acts	55	5	7
675	 that might constitute a violation of the tenets of the faith.	55	5	7
676	 Who will stand judge?	55	5	7
677	 Seven septons as it was in all trials before the Targaryens.	55	5	7
678	 Will you be one of them?	55	5	7
679	 I will.	55	5	7
680	 If one or both of them	55	5	7
681	 were to confess before the trial...	55	5	7
682	 Then they will be shown the Mother's mercy.	55	5	7
683	 And what does the Mother's mercy entail?	55	5	7
684	 It depends upon the situation.	55	5	7
685	 The acts themselves, the degree of contrition.	55	5	7
686	 Thank you, High Septon,	55	5	7
687	 for bringing them whatever justice they deserve	55	5	7
688	 in the eyes of the Seven.	55	5	7
689	 Did you know this chapel	56	5	7
690	 is one of the oldest structures in King's Landing?	56	5	7
691	 I think I may have heard at one point.	56	5	7
692	 Baelor built his sept around it.	56	5	7
693	 But men worshipped here long before him.	56	5	7
694	 Who carved this altar?	56	5	7
695	 - Do you know? - I'm afraid I don't.	56	5	7
696	 No one does.	56	5	7
697	 There's no name on it or anywhere else in the chapel.	56	5	7
698	 No, the people who built this place	56	5	7
699	 didn't inflict their vanity on those who came after them	56	5	7
700	 the way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity up there.	56	5	7
701	 Hmm.	56	5	7
702	 Their faith was clean.	56	5	7
703	 Strip away the gold and the ornaments,	56	5	7
704	 knock down the statues and the pillars,	56	5	7
705	 and this is what remains.	56	5	7
706	 Something simple...	56	5	7
707	 and solid and true.	57	5	7
708	 The Tyrells' finery will be stripped away.	57	5	7
709	 Their lies knocked down.	57	5	7
710	 Their true hearts laid bare for all to see.	57	5	7
711	 And so it will be for all of us.	57	5	7
712	 High and low alike.	57	5	7
713	 What will we find	57	5	7
714	 when we strip away your finery?	57	5	7
715	 A young man came to us not long ago.	57	5	7
716	 Broken in body and spirit.	57	5	7
717	 He had so much to strip away.	57	5	7
718	 So much weighing him down.	57	5	7
719	 But piece by piece, he unburdened himself.	57	5	7
720	 Let go of vanity,	58	5	7
721	 pride, sin.	58	5	7
722	 Now his soul is so light,	58	5	7
723	 he will float through the Seven Heavens like a bird.	58	5	7
724	 Hmm.	58	5	7
725	 And he has much to say about you.	58	5	7
726	 Move.	58	5	7
727	 Let me go immediately.	58	5	7
728	 You will order her to let me go.	58	5	7
729	 I am the queen! I am the queen!	58	5	7
730	 Have you lost your mind?	59	5	7
731	 Let me go!	59	5	7
732	 Get your filthy hands off me!	59	5	7
733	 Have you lost your mind?	59	5	7
734	 I am the queen! Let me go!	59	5	7
735	 Look at me.	59	5	7
736	 Look at my face.	59	5	7
737	 It's the last thing you'll see before you die.	59	5	7

2	 The Lannisters aren't the only ones that pay their debts.	0	4	2
3	 Ser Dontos...	0	4	2
4	 Once I was a knight, now I am only a fool. But a living fool, thanks to you.	0	4	2
5	  It's not a good time.  It's never a good time.	0	4	2
6	 You have your child bride. If you want me to leave, just say it.	0	4	2
7	 You told me to come at once if there was anything important.	0	4	2
8	 I'm Jojen Reed. This is my sister, Meera.	0	4	2
9	 We've come a long way to find you, Brandon.	0	4	2
10	 You're a warg. It's in your blood.	0	4	2
11	 I don't want you talking to me anymore, until we get to Castle Black.	0	4	2
12	 We're not going to Castle Black.	0	4	2
13	 Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.	0	4	2
14	 I thank God for bringing Melisandre to us.	0	4	2
15	 She gave you a son.	0	4	2
16	 I gave you nothing.	0	4	2
17	 That's not true. I want to see my daughter.	1	4	2
18	 I am marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden.	1	4	2
19	 You don't really plan on staying in the King's Guard, do you?	1	4	2
20	 Ser Jaime Lannister, a 40 year old knight with one hand.	1	4	2
21	 I use my left hand now, Your Grace. Makes it more of a contest.	1	4	2
22	  Winterfell is in ruins.  What happened out there?	1	4	2
23	 I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place.	1	4	2
24	 I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.	1	4	2
25	  Please...  What is your name?	1	4	2
26	 Reek...	1	4	2
27		1	4	2
28	  ( woman laughing )   Tansy!	3	4	2
29	   Tansy! Tansy!	3	4	2
30	   Tansy!  ( dogs barking )	3	4	2
31	 ( growling )	3	4	2
32	 ( laughing )	3	4	2
33	 ( laughing )	4	4	2
34	   Tansy!	4	4	2
35	  ( screams )  There you are.	4	4	2
36	 ( barking )	4	4	2
37	 ( screaming )	4	4	2
38	 I can't see her, Ramsay.	4	4	2
39	 ( panting )	4	4	2
40	 Tansy!	4	4	2
41	 ( whimpering )	4	4	2
42	 If you make it out of the woods, you win!	4	4	2
43	 Run, Tansy, run!	4	4	2
44	 ( screams )	4	4	2
45	 ( whimpering )	4	4	2
46	 ( panting, crying )	4	4	2
47	   Tansy.   Where is she?	4	4	2
48	   Tansy, Tansy, Tansy! ( barking )	4	4	2
49	 ( whimpering )	4	4	2
50	 ( screams )	5	4	2
51	 ( crying )	5	4	2
52	 Good girls. Down, girls.	5	4	2
53	 Down.	5	4	2
54	 Well done. You, too.	5	4	2
55	  I only wounded her.  You brought her down. That's what matters.	5	4	2
56	 A fine shot. Wasn't it, Reek?	5	4	2
57	 A fine shot, master. My lady.	5	4	2
58	 Please, my lord. It hurts.	5	4	2
59	 Oh, sweet. Don't cry.	5	4	2
60	 It will be over soon.	5	4	2
61	 She thinks she's pretty.	5	4	2
62	 Let me put one through her face.	5	4	2
63	 We have to reward the hounds, love.	5	4	2
64	 They did all the hard work.	5	4	2
65	 Why? I did whatever you asked.	5	4	2
66	 But you made Myranda feel jealous.	5	4	2
67	  Me jealous of her?   My lord, please.	5	4	2
68	 You can see that your presence has become a bit of a problem.	5	4	2
69	  ( crying )  ( dogs snarling, barking )	6	4	2
70	 Rip her! Rip her!	6	4	2
71	  Rip her!   ( Tansy screaming )	6	4	2
72	 ( tearing )	6	4	2
73	 Not so pretty now.	6	4	2
74	   Your new hand, it's nicer than the old one.	6	4	2
75	 Wouldn't you agree, Pod?	6	4	2
76	 Is it solid gold?	6	4	2
77	 Gilded steel. You're not eating.	6	4	2
78	 Why is no one eating?	6	4	2
79	 My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself.	6	4	2
80	  I'm not hungry.  You lost a hand,	6	4	2
81	 not a stomach.	6	4	2
82	 Try the boar.	6	4	2
83	 Cersei can't get enough of it since one killed Robert for her.	6	4	2
84	 A toast.	6	4	2
85	 To the proud Lannister children.	6	4	2
86	 The dwarf, the cripple, and the mother of madness.	7	4	2
87	  Oh!  I'll clean it up.	7	4	2
88	 No, I'll do it. Leave us.	7	4	2
89	 It's only wine.	7	4	2
90	 I can't fight anymore.	7	4	2
91	 What about your left?	7	4	2
92	 I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong.	7	4	2
93	 How can I protect the king	7	4	2
94	 when I can hardly wipe my own ass?	7	4	2
95	 You're the Lord Commander now. Command.	7	4	2
96	 Let others do the fighting.	7	4	2
97	 When was the last time Father used a sword?	7	4	2
98	 I'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer.	7	4	2
99	 When people find out I can't slay a pigeon...	7	4	2
100	 Train, then. Learn to fight with your other hand.	7	4	2
101	 With whom? You? Men talk.	7	4	2
102	 Soon as someone discovers I can't fight, he'll tell everyone.	8	4	2
103	 You need a proper, discreet swordsman.	8	4	2
104	 As it happens, I have just the one.	8	4	2
105	 My brother tells me you can keep your mouth shut.	8	4	2
106	 Unusual talent for a sellsword.	8	4	2
107	 He tells me you shit gold	8	4	2
108	 just like your father.	8	4	2
109	 Is this place safe?	8	4	2
110	 There's this knight, Leygood,	8	4	2
111	  got thunderbolts on his shield.  Uhhuh.	8	4	2
112	 Right here is where I fuck his wife.	8	4	2
113	 She's a screamer, that one.	8	4	2
114	 If they don't hear her, they won't hear us.	8	4	2
115	 ( whistles ) I've never seen Valyrian steel before.	8	4	2
116	 She's a beauty. The problem is,	8	4	2
117	 if you fight with an edged blade,	9	4	2
118	 I'll have to.	9	4	2
119	 And if I fight with an edged blade,	9	4	2
120	 I'll have no one left to pay me.	9	4	2
121	 ( blade clatters )	9	4	2
122	 I haven't used a sparring sword since I was nine.	9	4	2
123	 Ah!	9	4	2
124	 Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guard's down.	9	4	2
125	 Best time to attack a man.	9	4	2
126	 Mind yourself.	9	4	2
127	  If I still had my right hand...  Plan on growing it back?	9	4	2
128	 Come on, then.	9	4	2
129	  Open the gates!	10	4	2
130	 Riders coming in!	10	4	2
131	 ( horse whinnies )	10	4	2
132	   Let's get these horses seen to!	10	4	2
133	 Father. Welcome home.	10	4	2
134	 Walda, this is Ramsay Snow, my bastard.	10	4	2
135	 A pleasure, Mother.	10	4	2
136	 Hello.	10	4	2
137	   See that the horses are fed, watered, and rubbed down.	10	4	2
138	 And take Lady Walda to her chambers.	10	4	2
139	 This way, my lady.	10	4	2
140	 Where is your prize?	11	4	2
141	 With the hounds.	11	4	2
142	 I'll have a look at him.	11	4	2
143	 I hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer.	11	4	2
144	 Word travels. How he screamed.	11	4	2
145	  You would have loved it.  ( laughs )	11	4	2
146	 Father.	11	4	2
147	 What did you do to him?	11	4	2
148	 I trained him. He was a slow learner, but he learned.	11	4	2
149	 You flayed him.	11	4	2
150	 Peeled a few bits.	11	4	2
151	 Removed a few others.	11	4	2
152	 This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.	12	4	2
153	 We've been flaying our enemies for 1,000 years.	12	4	2
154	 The flayed man is on our banners.	12	4	2
155	 My banners, not yours.	12	4	2
156	 You're not a Bolton. You're a Snow.	12	4	2
157	 Tywin Lannister has given me the North.	12	4	2
158	 But he won't lift a finger to help me take it.	12	4	2
159	 As long as the ironborn hold Moat Cailin,	12	4	2
160	 our armies are trapped south of the Neck.	12	4	2
161	 Theon was a valuable hostage, not your plaything.	12	4	2
162	 I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin.	12	4	2
163	 I already asked.	12	4	2
164	 Lord Greyjoy refused. Savages have no	12	4	2
165	 You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent?	12	4	2
166	 You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort.	12	4	2
167	 I acted.	12	4	2
168	 I had to smuggle myself into my own lands	12	4	2
169	 thanks to the Greyjoys.	12	4	2
170	 I needed Theon.	13	4	2
171	 I needed him whole.	13	4	2
172	 Theon was our enemy.	13	4	2
173	 But Reek,	13	4	2
174	 Reek will never betray us.	13	4	2
175	 I placed far too much trust in you.	13	4	2
176	 Reek, how could you let me stand before my father unshaven?	13	4	2
177	   It's disrespectful.  I'm sorry, my lord.	13	4	2
178	 Give him the razor.	13	4	2
179	 If I'm not a Bolton, Father, what does it matter?	13	4	2
180	 Go on, Reek.	14	4	2
181	 A nice close shave.	14	4	2
182	 Reek, tell Father	14	4	2
183	 where are Bran and Rickon Stark?	14	4	2
184	 I don't know, my lord.	14	4	2
185	 You murdered them	14	4	2
186	 and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.	14	4	2
187	   Reek,	14	4	2
188	 did you murder the Stark boys?	14	4	2
189	 No, my lord.	14	4	2
190	 Just two farm boys.	14	4	2
191	   And crisped them so no one would know.	14	4	2
192	  Yes, my lord.	14	4	2
193	 The Starks have always ruled the North.	15	4	2
194	 If Bran and Rickon are alive,	15	4	2
195	 the country will rally to their side	15	4	2
196	 now that Robb Stark is gone.	15	4	2
197	 Oh, that's right, Reek.	15	4	2
198	 Robb Stark is dead.	15	4	2
199	 Sorry.	15	4	2
200	 I know he was like a brother to you.	15	4	2
201	 But my father put a knife through his heart.	15	4	2
202	 How do you feel about that?	15	4	2
203	  You ready for a hunt?  Always.	15	4	2
204	 Find those boys and I'll give you 1,000 acres and a holdfast.	15	4	2
205	 Your pet rat have any thoughts	16	4	2
206	 on which way they went after Winterfell?	16	4	2
207	 Jon Snow is at Castle Black.	16	4	2
208	 Who the fuck is Jon Snow?	16	4	2
209	 Their bastard brother.	16	4	2
210	 He could be sheltering them.	16	4	2
211	 He may know where they are.	16	4	2
212	 Even if he doesn't, he's half Stark himself.	16	4	2
213	 Could be a threat.	16	4	2
214	 You want to prove yourself a Bolton?	16	4	2
215	 Gather whatever men you can and ride for Moat Cailin.	16	4	2
216	 Bring this creature of yours.	16	4	2
217	 Maybe he'll be of some use.	16	4	2
218	 Take the Moat for the family,	16	4	2
219	 for our family,	16	4	2
220	 and I'll reconsider your position.	16	4	2
221	 Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the king?	16	4	2
222	 I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome at such exclusive affairs.	16	4	2
223	  Oh, to be foreign.  Ahem.	17	4	2
224	 Shae has been noticed.	17	4	2
225	 Sansa's maid saw you with her.	17	4	2
226	 She already told your sister.	17	4	2
227	 It's only a matter of time before your father hears.	17	4	2
228	 So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden.	17	4	2
229	 My father will ask you if there's anything more	17	4	2
230	 and you'll tell him some clever lie.	17	4	2
231	 No, I will not.	17	4	2
232	 How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live	17	4	2
233	 if they suspected me of lying?	17	4	2
234	 I have no pet sellsword to protect me.	17	4	2
235	 No legendary brother to avenge me.	17	4	2
236	 Only little birds who whisper in my ear.	17	4	2
237	 Forgive me if I don't weep for you.	17	4	2
238	 No one weeps for spiders or whores.	17	4	2
239	 I have friends across the sea who could help her.	17	4	2
240	 She won't leave.	17	4	2
241	 I've told her this is a dangerous place	17	4	2
242	 so many times, she no longer believes it.	17	4	2
243	 Your father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with.	17	4	2
244	 Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat?	17	4	2
245	 From House Tyrell and the people of the Reach,	18	4	2
246	 Your Grace, it is my honor to present you with this wedding cup.	18	4	2
247	 May you and my daughter Margaery	18	4	2
248	 drink deep and live long.	18	4	2
249	 A handsome goblet, my lord.	18	4	2
250	 Or shall I call you Father?	18	4	2
251	 I shall be honored, Your Grace.	18	4	2
252	 She's the whore I told you about.	18	4	2
253	 The dark-haired one.	18	4	2
254	 Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding.	18	4	2
255	 A book?	18	4	2
256	 The Lives of Four Kings. Grand Maester Kaeth's history	18	4	2
257	 of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon,	18	4	2
258	 Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good.	18	4	2
259	 A book every king should read.	19	4	2
260	 Now that the war is won,	19	4	2
261	 we should all find time for wisdom.	19	4	2
262	 Thank you, Uncle.	19	4	2
263	 One of only two Valyrian steel swords in the capital,	19	4	2
264	 Your Grace, freshly forged in your honor.	19	4	2
265	 Careful, Your Grace. Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel.	20	4	2
266	 So they say.	20	4	2
267	 ( panting )	20	4	2
268	 Such a great sword should have a name.	20	4	2
269	  What shall I call her?   Stormbringer.	20	4	2
270	  Man #2: Terminus.  Man #3: Widow's Wail.	20	4	2
271	  Man #4: Wolfsbane.  Widow's Wail. I like that.	20	4	2
272	 ( chuckles )	20	4	2
273	 Every time I use it, it'll be like cutting off	20	4	2
274	 Ned Stark's head all over again.	20	4	2
275	 ( door opens )	21	4	2
276	 Don't.	21	4	2
277	 You want me on the desk?	21	4	2
278	   What's wrong, my lion?  Don't call me that.	21	4	2
279	 What should I call you?	21	4	2
280	 I'm afraid our friendship can't continue.	21	4	2
281	 Our friendship?	21	4	2
282	 There's a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos.	21	4	2
283	 What?	21	4	2
284	 You'll have your own cabin, of course,	21	4	2
285	 and across the Narrow Sea a house, servants.	21	4	2
286	 What is this?	21	4	2
287	 I'm a married man.	21	4	2
288	 My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know.	21	4	2
289	 I don't want her to suffer anymore on my account.	21	4	2
290	 I need to uphold my vows.	21	4	2
291	 She doesn't want you.	21	4	2
292	   I need to do right by her.  You don't want her.	21	4	2
293	 By our children.	22	4	2
294	  What are you afraid of?  I'm not afraid.	22	4	2
295	 You are. You are afraid of your father and your sister.	22	4	2
296	  You're going to run from them all your life?  I need you to leave.	22	4	2
297	 I'm not afraid of them. I'm not going to run.	22	4	2
298	  Shae.  We will fight them together.	22	4	2
299	 It's like you said, I am yours and you are mine.	22	4	2
300	 You're a whore!	22	4	2
301	 Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not.	22	4	2
302	 I can't be in love with a whore.	22	4	2
303	 I can't have children with a whore.	22	4	2
304	 How many men have you been with?	22	4	2
305	 500? 5,000?	22	4	2
306	 How many whores have you been with?	22	4	2
307	 I have enjoyed my time with all of them	22	4	2
308	 and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all.	22	4	2
309	 But now that time is over.	22	4	2
310	 ( Shae crying )	23	4	2
311	 You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos.	23	4	2
312	 Bronn will escort you to your ship.	23	4	2
313	 ( door closes )	23	4	2
314	  ( woman screaming )   Hear us now.	23	4	2
315	 Accept these tokens of our faith, my lord,	23	4	2
316	 and lead us from the darkness.	24	4	2
317	 ( crying )	24	4	2
318	 Sire, I served you well.	24	4	2
319	 ( crowd chanting ) Lord of Light, show us the way...	24	4	2
320	 Selyse, you're my sister!	24	4	2
321	 Yours are the stars that guide us.	24	4	2
322	 Tell him! Tell him!	24	4	2
323	   Lord of Light, protect us,	24	4	2
324	 for the night is dark and full of terrors.	24	4	2
325	 ( screaming )	24	4	2
326	 Did you see? Their souls.	24	4	2
327	 It was their souls.	24	4	2
328	 Our lord took them. Did you see?	24	4	2
329	 Lord Florent was your brother by law.	24	4	2
330	 He was an infidel.	24	4	2
331	 He worshipped the gods of his fathers	25	4	2
332	 and their fathers before him.	25	4	2
333	 They were the gods of your fathers, too.	25	4	2
334	 I ordered him to tear down his idols.	25	4	2
335	 He disobeyed.	25	4	2
336	 How many ships did he bring to your cause?	25	4	2
337	 How many men?	25	4	2
338	 A good deal more than you.	25	4	2
339	 Did you see, Ser Davos?	25	4	2
340	 They're with our lord now.	25	4	2
341	 Their sins all burned away. Did you see?	25	4	2
342	 I'm sure they're more than grateful, my queen.	25	4	2
343	 ( sniffs )	25	4	2
344	 Meat's off.	25	4	2
345	 Our larders are almost empty.	25	4	2
346	 Serve fish, then. We're on an island.	25	4	2
347	 You hate fish.	25	4	2
348	 I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same.	25	4	2
349	 When Storm's End was under siege and I was starving,	26	4	2
350	 Stannis boiled soup for me from books.	26	4	2
351	 The binding glue is made from horses.	26	4	2
352	 One morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach.	26	4	2
353	 I've never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull.	26	4	2
354	  Do you remember?  Of course I remember.	26	4	2
355	 Have you ever known true hunger, my lady?	26	4	2
356	 It's all I knew when I was a child.	26	4	2
357	 Until you found the Lord of Light?	26	4	2
358	 Until he found me.	26	4	2
359	 I fear for our daughter's soul.	26	4	2
360	 Every mother should fear for her child's soul.	26	4	2
361	  She's a stubborn little beast.  She's a child.	26	4	2
362	 You barely know her.	27	4	2
363	 You think she's sweet because she smiles when you visit.	27	4	2
364	 She's sullen and stubborn and sinful.	27	4	2
365	 Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face?	27	4	2
366	 She needs the rod.	27	4	2
367	 She's my daughter. You will not strike her.	27	4	2
368	 As you command.	27	4	2
369	 Perhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her.	27	4	2
370	 ( knocks )	27	4	2
371	 Come in.	27	4	2
372	 Were you sleeping, Princess?	27	4	2
373	 Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?	27	4	2
374	 I heard it.	27	4	2
375	 And it frightened you?	27	4	2
376	 Ser Axel was my uncle.	27	4	2
377	 He was always kind to me.	27	4	2
378	 They're in a better place now, Princess.	27	4	2
379	 The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world.	28	4	2
380	 But they screamed.	28	4	2
381	 Women scream when they give birth.	28	4	2
382	 Afterward they are filled with joy.	28	4	2
383	 Afterward they aren't ash and bone.	28	4	2
384	 You have so many questions, don't you?	28	4	2
385	 So did I when I was a child.	28	4	2
386	 I was much like you.	28	4	2
387	 Only I wasn't a princess.	28	4	2
388	 And you didn't have this.	28	4	2
389	 No.	28	4	2
390	 But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me.	28	4	2
391	 What do you know of the gods?	28	4	2
392	 I read The Seven-Pointed Star.	28	4	2
393	 Lies and fables.	28	4	2
394	 Septons speak of seven gods.	28	4	2
395	 There are but two	28	4	2
396	 a god of light and love and joy	28	4	2
397	 and a god of darkness, evil, and fear.	28	4	2
398	 Eternally at war.	28	4	2
399	 There are no seven heavens and no seven hells?	28	4	2
400	 There's only one hell, Princess.	28	4	2
401	 The one we live in now.	29	4	2
402	 ( heavy breathing )	29	4	2
403	 ( growls )	29	4	2
404	   Hodor.  ( breathing heavily )	29	4	2
405	 Why did you wake me?	29	4	2
406	 You've been gone for hours.	29	4	2
407	 I was hungry.	29	4	2
408	 We're all hungry.	29	4	2
409	 I was just eating.	30	4	2
410	 Summer was eating.	30	4	2
411	 Your body can't live on the food your wolf consumes.	30	4	2
412	 Spending too much time in Summer's skin is dangerous.	30	4	2
413	 You're not a direwolf, Bran.	30	4	2
414	 Must be glorious, though.	30	4	2
415	 To run, to leap, to hunt.	30	4	2
416	 To be whole.	30	4	2
417	 I know that's tempting,	30	4	2
418	 but if you're trapped in Summer for too long,	30	4	2
419	 you'll forget what it was to be human.	30	4	2
420	 You'd forget us, Bran.	30	4	2
421	 You'd forget your mother and father.	30	4	2
422	 You'd forget your brothers and sisters.	30	4	2
423	 You'd forget Winterfell.	30	4	2
424	 You'd forget you.	30	4	2
425	 And if we lose you, we lose everything.	30	4	2
426	 ( wind blowing )	31	4	2
427	 ( wolf barks )	31	4	2
428	 Hodor, take me to the tree.	31	4	2
429	 ( caws )	32	4	2
430	  Look for me...	32	4	2
431	 ( cawing )	32	4	2
432	  ...beneath the tree.	32	4	2
433	   He saw us.  ( screaming )	32	4	2
434	 ( dragon roaring )	32	4	2
435	  North.	32	4	2
436	 ( gasps )	32	4	2
437	 I know where we have to go.	33	4	2
438	 ( bells tolling )	33	4	2
439	 Let it be known that Margaery of House Tyrell	33	4	2
440	 and Joffrey of the Houses Lannister and Baratheon	34	4	2
441	 are one heart, one flesh, one soul.	34	4	2
442	 Cursed be he	34	4	2
443	 who would seek to tear them asunder.	34	4	2
444	 With this kiss, I pledge my love.	34	4	2
445	 ( applause )	34	4	2
446	 We have a new queen.	34	4	2
447	 Better her than you.	34	4	2
448	  Bit much, wouldn't you say?  It feels proportionate.	35	4	2
449	  Proportionate to what?  The expected extravagance.	35	4	2
450	 People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense	35	4	2
451	 tend not to have it for long.	35	4	2
452	 You ought to try enjoying something before you die.	35	4	2
453	 You might find it suits you.	35	4	2
454	 Not now, Mace. Lord Tywin and I are speaking.	35	4	2
455	 Anyway, I don't know what you're complaining about.	35	4	2
456	 I'm paying my share.	35	4	2
457	 Shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies	35	4	2
458	 to commemorate your generosity?	35	4	2
459	 No, your heartfelt thank-you is its own reward.	35	4	2
460	 I would imagine I'd be hearing it again before long.	35	4	2
461	 Wars are rather expensive.	35	4	2
462	 The Iron Bank will have its due.	35	4	2
463	 How they love to remind everyone.	35	4	2
464	 Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts.	35	4	2
465	 I'm not worried about the Iron Bank.	35	4	2
466	 We both know you're smarter than that.	35	4	2
467	 Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love.	36	4	2
468	   ( music playing )  ( people laughing, chatting )	36	4	2
469	 All taken care of.	36	4	2
470	  You saw her board the ship?  Aye, she's on it.	36	4	2
471	 You saw the ship sail away?	36	4	2
472	 No one knows she's there but you, me, and Varys.	36	4	2
473	 How do you know?	36	4	2
474	 Because if someone follows me without an invitation,	36	4	2
475	 I'm the last person they ever follow.	36	4	2
476	 There's someone following you?	36	4	2
477	 She's gone.	36	4	2
478	 I know you don't want to believe it, but she is.	36	4	2
479	 Now, go drink till it feels like you did the right thing.	36	4	2
480	 Hello.	36	4	2
481	  Hello.  Not you.	36	4	2
482	 You look exquisite, child.	37	4	2
483	 The wind has been at you, though.	37	4	2
484	 I haven't had the opportunity to tell you	37	4	2
485	 how sorry I was to hear about your brother.	37	4	2
486	 War is war, but killing a man at a wedding,	37	4	2
487	 horrid.	37	4	2
488	 What sort of monster would do such a thing?	37	4	2
489	 As if men need more reasons to fear marriage.	37	4	2
490	 My lady. My lady.	37	4	2
491	 Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that.	37	4	2
492	 Perhaps if your pauper husband	37	4	2
493	 were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes,	37	4	2
494	 he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit.	37	4	2
495	 Now that peace has come and all is right with the world,	37	4	2
496	 it would do you good to see some of it.	38	4	2
497	 You must excuse me. It's time I ate	38	4	2
498	 some of this food I paid for.	38	4	2
499	    A coat of gold   	38	4	2
500	    Or a coat of red   	38	4	2
501	    A lion still has claws   	38	4	2
502	    And mine, my lord...   	38	4	2
503	 Very good. Very good. Off you go.	38	4	2
504	  ( coins clatter )  ( crowd laughs )	38	4	2
505	 My love, why don't we make the announcement?	38	4	2
506	 ( taps goblet )	38	4	2
507	 Everyone.	38	4	2
508	 The queen would like to say a few words.	38	4	2
509	 ( applause )	39	4	2
510	 We are so fortunate	39	4	2
511	 to enjoy this marvelous food and drink.	39	4	2
512	 Not all among us are so lucky.	39	4	2
513	 To thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end,	39	4	2
514	 King Joffrey has decreed that the leftovers	39	4	2
515	 from our feast be given to the poorest in his city.	39	4	2
516	  ( applause )   ( music playing )	39	4	2
517	 You're an example to us all.	39	4	2
518	 Ser Jaime, I'm very sorry.	40	4	2
519	 Ser Loras, it's quite all right.	40	4	2
520	 Your sister looks very beautiful.	40	4	2
521	  As does yours.	40	4	2
522	 So, looking forward to your wedding?	40	4	2
523	 Yes, very much.	40	4	2
524	 Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.	40	4	2
525	 They certainly are.	40	4	2
526	 Perhaps they should get married.	40	4	2
527	 ( laughs )	40	4	2
528	 If you were to marry Cersei,	40	4	2
529	 she'd murder you in your sleep.	40	4	2
530	 If you somehow managed to put a child in her first,	40	4	2
531	 she'd murder him, too,	40	4	2
532	 long before he drew his first breath.	40	4	2
533	 Luckily for you, none of this will happen	40	4	2
534	 because you'll never marry her.	40	4	2
535	 And neither will you.	40	4	2
536	 Your Grace. My king.	41	4	2
537	  My queen.  Lady Brienne.	41	4	2
538	 So good of you to come.	41	4	2
539	 I'm no lady, Your Grace.	41	4	2
540	 Did you just bow?	41	4	2
541	 Apologies, Your Grace.	41	4	2
542	 I never did master the curtsy.	41	4	2
543	 You're the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon.	41	4	2
544	 That's not true, my love. Brienne had nothing to do with it.	41	4	2
545	 A shame.	41	4	2
546	 I'd knight the man that put an end to that deviant's life.	41	4	2
547	 I just wanted to congratulate you both	41	4	2
548	 and wish you good fortune.	41	4	2
549	 The country has been at war too long.	41	4	2
550	 I hope your reign is long and peaceful.	41	4	2
551	  Yes, yes.  Thank you.	41	4	2
552	 I hope we see more of you.	41	4	2
553	 Lady Brienne.	42	4	2
554	 You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter.	42	4	2
555	 That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not.	42	4	2
556	 As you say, Your Grace.	42	4	2
557	 I owe you my gratitude.	42	4	2
558	 You returned my brother safely to King's Landing.	42	4	2
559	 In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace.	42	4	2
560	 More than once.	42	4	2
561	 Did he?	42	4	2
562	 Haven't heard that story before.	42	4	2
563	 Not such a fascinating story, I'm afraid.	42	4	2
564	 I'm sure you have many fascinating stories.	42	4	2
565	 Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother.	42	4	2
566	 Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next	42	4	2
567	 serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.	42	4	2
568	 I don't serve your brother, Your Grace.	42	4	2
569	 But you love him.	42	4	2
570	 Your Grace.	43	4	2
571	 No, no, come to my chambers and I will examine you personally.	43	4	2
572	  She'll do no such thing.  Oh, Your Grace.	43	4	2
573	 Yes, well, this young lady sought my advice	43	4	2
574	 You should see Qyburn. He's quite good.	43	4	2
575	  Your Grace.  Qyburn? Deplorable man.	43	4	2
576	 Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments.	43	4	2
577	 More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?	43	4	2
578	 Your Grace, I am a man of learning.	43	4	2
579	 My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him.	43	4	2
580	 What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me?	43	4	2
581	 I never meant to annoy anyone.	43	4	2
582	 But you are. You annoy me right now.	43	4	2
583	 Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me.	43	4	2
584	 So here's what I want you to do.	43	4	2
585	 I want you to leave my presence.	43	4	2
586	 Leave this wedding right now.	43	4	2
587	 Go to the kitchens and instruct them	43	4	2
588	 that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.	44	4	2
589	 Your Grace, Queen Margaery	44	4	2
590	 The queen is telling you	44	4	2
591	 the leftovers will feed the dogs	44	4	2
592	 or you will.	44	4	2
593	 A gold dragon to whoever knocks my fool's hat off.	44	4	2
594	 ( crowd laughing )	44	4	2
595	 You're in rather a good mood.	44	4	2
596	  I suppose I am.  I won't ask why.	44	4	2
597	  Small pleasures.  Your Grace. Lord Tywin.	44	4	2
598	 Prince Oberyn.	45	4	2
599	 I don't believe you have met Ellaria.	45	4	2
600	 This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister	45	4	2
601	 and Cersei Lannister the Queen Regent.	45	4	2
602	 I suppose it is former Queen Regent now.	45	4	2
603	 Lord Hand and Lady Cersei,	45	4	2
604	  Ellaria Sand.  My lord. My lady.	45	4	2
605	 Charmed.	45	4	2
606	 Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.	45	4	2
607	 We are everywhere in Dorne.	45	4	2
608	 I have 10,000 brothers and sisters.	45	4	2
609	 Bastards are born of passion, aren't they?	45	4	2
610	 We don't despise them in Dorne.	45	4	2
611	 No? How tolerant of you.	45	4	2
612	 I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei,	45	4	2
613	 giving up your regal responsibilities.	45	4	2
614	 Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked.	45	4	2
615	 I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn.	45	4	2
616	 It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding.	45	4	2
617	 Please give him our regards.	45	4	2
618	 With any luck, the gout will abate	45	4	2
619	 with time and he will be able to walk again.	45	4	2
620	 They call it the rich man's disease.	45	4	2
621	 A wonder you don't have it.	46	4	2
622	 Noblemen in my part of the country	46	4	2
623	 don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.	46	4	2
624	 People everywhere have their differences.	46	4	2
625	 In some places the highborn frown upon those of low birth.	46	4	2
626	 In other places the rape and murder of women and children	46	4	2
627	 is considered distasteful.	46	4	2
628	 What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent,	46	4	2
629	 that your daughter Myrcella has been sent	46	4	2
630	 to live in the latter sort of place.	46	4	2
631	 ( taps goblet )	46	4	2
632	 Everyone, silence! Clear the floor.	46	4	2
633	 There's been too much amusement here today.	46	4	2
634	 A royal wedding is not an amusement.	46	4	2
635	 A royal wedding is history.	46	4	2
636	 The time has come for all of us	46	4	2
637	 to contemplate our history.	46	4	2
638	 My lords...	46	4	2
639	 my ladies...	47	4	2
640	 I give you	47	4	2
641	  King Joffrey...  ( shouting )	47	4	2
642	 ...Renly, Stannis,	47	4	2
643	 Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy.	47	4	2
644	 The War of the Five Kings.	47	4	2
645	 ( applause, laughter )	47	4	2
646	 I'm the rightful king.	47	4	2
647	  King in the North!  Yes!	47	4	2
648	   Traitor. You're a traitor.  ( laughing )	47	4	2
649	 For the Seven Kingdoms!	47	4	2
650	 Let the war begin.	47	4	2
651	  ( laughing )  ( howls )	47	4	2
652	 Renly, you're no king.	47	4	2
653	 Away, degenerate. Away. Away.	47	4	2
654	 Ooh, careful. ( squeals )	47	4	2
655	  Go on.  I want you to be my prince.	48	4	2
656	 ( laughing )	48	4	2
657	 Stannis!	48	4	2
658	 Who's got the gold now, Stark?	48	4	2
659	 I am the rightful king. Challenge me, ruffian.	48	4	2
660	  Take that.  I'm drowning. I'm drowning.	48	4	2
661	 I am the King in the North!	48	4	2
662	 Not wildfire!	48	4	2
663	  ( laughing )  ( crying )	48	4	2
664	 Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done.	48	4	2
665	  Yes, my lord.	48	4	2
666	 We'll have to find another way to thank the king.	48	4	2
667	 Charge!	48	4	2
668	 Ready, again.	49	4	2
669	 I am the King in the North!	49	4	2
670	  Charge!  Charge!	49	4	2
671	  Yes!   ( crowd cheers )	49	4	2
672	   Your head!  ( laughing )	49	4	2
673	 ( laughing )	49	4	2
674	 ( grunting )	49	4	2
675	 ( laughing )	49	4	2
676	 Fine gentlemen.	49	4	2
677	 ( applause )	50	4	2
678	 Well fought. Well fought.	50	4	2
679	 Here you are. Champion's purse.	50	4	2
680	 Though you're not the champion yet, are you?	50	4	2
681	 A true champion defeats all the challengers.	50	4	2
682	 Surely there are others out there	50	4	2
683	 who still dare to challenge my reign.	50	4	2
684	 Uncle.	50	4	2
685	 How about you? I'm sure they have a spare costume.	50	4	2
686	 ( crowd laughs )	50	4	2
687	 One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace.	50	4	2
688	 I would like to keep what remains of my face.	50	4	2
689	 I think you should fight him.	50	4	2
690	 This was but a poor imitation	50	4	2
691	 of your own bravery on the field of battle.	50	4	2
692	 I speak as a firsthand witness.	50	4	2
693	 Climb down from the high table	51	4	2
694	 with your new Valyrian sword	51	4	2
695	 and show everyone how a true king wins his throne.	51	4	2
696	 Be careful, though.	51	4	2
697	 This one is clearly mad with lust.	51	4	2
698	 It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue	51	4	2
699	 hours before his wedding night.	51	4	2
700	 ( light laughter )	51	4	2
701	 A fine vintage.	51	4	2
702	 Shame that it spilled.	51	4	2
703	 It did not spill.	52	4	2
704	 My love, come back to me.	52	4	2
705	 It's time for my father's toast.	52	4	2
706	 ( applause )	52	4	2
707	 Well, how does he expect me to toast without wine?	52	4	2
708	 Uncle, you can be my cupbearer	52	4	2
709	 seeing as you're too cowardly to fight.	52	4	2
710	 Your Grace does me a great honor.	52	4	2
711	 It's not meant as an honor.	52	4	2
712	 Bring me my goblet.	53	4	2
713	 What good is an empty cup?	53	4	2
714	 Fill it.	53	4	2
715	 Kneel.	53	4	2
716	 Kneel before your king.	53	4	2
717	 Kneel.	54	4	2
718	 I said...	54	4	2
719	 kneel!	54	4	2
720	 Look, the pie.	54	4	2
721	 ( applause )	54	4	2
722	 My queen.	54	4	2
723	  ( gasps )  ( applause )	54	4	2
724	  Wonderful.	54	4	2
725	 Wonderful.	54	4	2
726	 My hero.	55	4	2
727	  Can we leave now?  Let's find out.	55	4	2
728	 Uncle.	55	4	2
729	 Where are you going?	55	4	2
730	 You're my cupbearer, remember?	55	4	2
731	 I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace.	55	4	2
732	 No, no, no. No, you're perfect the way you are.	55	4	2
733	 Serve me my wine.	55	4	2
734	 Well, hurry up. This pie is dry.	55	4	2
735	 Mm, good.	55	4	2
736	 Needs washing down.	55	4	2
737	 If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired.	56	4	2
738	 No. ( coughs )	56	4	2
739	 No, you'll wait here...	56	4	2
740	 ( coughs )	56	4	2
741	 un-- ( coughs )	56	4	2
742	  ( coughing )  Your Grace?	56	4	2
743	 ( coughing ) It's nothing.	56	4	2
744	 ( gasping )	56	4	2
745	  He's choking!  Help the poor boy.	56	4	2
746	 ( gasping )	56	4	2
747	  Idiots, help your king.  Move away!	56	4	2
748	 ( choking )	56	4	2
749	  Joffrey! Joffrey!   Help him!	56	4	2
750	  Someone help him!  Joffrey!	56	4	2
751	 ( gagging )	56	4	2
752	  Come with me now.   Joffrey! Joffrey!	56	4	2
753	 If you want to live, we have to leave.	56	4	2
754	 Don't touch him!	56	4	2
755	 ( gurgling )	56	4	2
756	  Joffrey.  ( gasping )	57	4	2
757	 Please, Joffrey.	57	4	2
758	 Joffrey, what is it?	57	4	2
759	 Help him!	57	4	2
760	 ( gasps )	57	4	2
761	 ( crying ) My son.	57	4	2
762	 ( crowd sobbing )	57	4	2
763	  He's gone. Our king is gone.	57	4	2
764	 He did this.	58	4	2
765	 He poisoned my son,	58	4	2
766	 your king.	58	4	2
767	 Take him. Take him!	58	4	2
768	 Take him!	58	4	2
769	 Take him!	58	4	2

773	    Or a coat of red   	58	4	2
774	    A lion still has claws   	58	4	2
775	    And mine are long   	59	4	2
776	    And sharp, my lord   	59	4	2
777	    As long and sharp as yours   	59	4	2
778	    And so he spoke and so he spoke   	59	4	2
779	    That Lord of Castamere   	59	4	2
780	    And now the rains   	59	4	2
781	    Weep o'er his hall   	59	4	2
782	    With no one there to hear   	59	4	2
783	    Yes, now the rains   	59	4	2
784	    Weep o'er his hall   	59	4	2
785	    And not a soul to hear.   	59	4	2

0	 3 Your pardon, Your Grace.	2	1	6
1	 I would rise, but...	2	1	6
2	 Do you know what your wife has done?	2	1	6
3	 She did nothing I did not command.	2	1	6
4	 Who'd have thought she had it in her?	2	1	6
5	 By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?	3	1	6
6	 I am the King's Hand, charged with keeping the peace...	3	1	6
7	 You were the King's Hand.	3	1	6
8	 You shall now be held accountable.	3	1	6
9	 Oh, will both of you shut your mouths?!	3	1	6
10	 Catelyn will release Tyrion and you'll make your peace with Jaime.	3	1	6
11	 He butchered my men--	3	1	6
12	 Lord Stark was returning drunk	3	1	6
13	 from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.	3	1	6
14	 - Quiet, woman. - Jaime has fled the city.	3	1	6
15	 Give me leave to bring him back to justice.	3	1	6
16	 I took you for a King.	3	1	6
17	 - Hold your tongue. - He's attacked	3	1	6
18	 one of my brothers and abducted the other.	3	1	6
19	 I should wear the armor and you the gown.	3	1	6
20	 I shall wear this like a badge of honor.	3	1	6
21	 Wear it in silence or I'll honor you again.	4	1	6
22	 See what she does to me?	4	1	6
23	 My loving wife.	4	1	6
24	 I should not have hit her.	4	1	6
25	 That was not...	4	1	6
26	 That was not Kingly.	4	1	6
27	 If we don't act,	4	1	6
28	 there will be a war.	4	1	6
29	 So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp	4	1	6
30	 to King's Landing.	4	1	6
31	 She's had her fun, now put an end to it.	5	1	6
32	 You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it.	5	1	6
33	 And what about Jaime Lannister?	5	1	6
34	 - What about Jaime? - I'm half a Kingdom in debt	5	1	6
35	 to his bloody father.	5	1	6
36	 I don't know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits.	5	1	6
37	 I don't want to know. This is what matters--	5	1	6
38	 I can't rule the Kingdoms	5	1	6
39	 if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other's throats.	5	1	6
40	 So enough.	5	1	6
41	 As you command, Your Grace.	5	1	6
42	 With your leave,	5	1	6
43	 I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight.	5	1	6
44	 Piss on that. Send a raven.	5	1	6
45	 I want you to stay.	5	1	6
46	 I'm the King. I get what I want.	5	1	6
47	 I never loved my brothers.	6	1	6
48	 A sad thing for a man to admit, but it's true.	6	1	6
49	 You were the brother I chose.	6	1	6
50	 We'll talk when I return from the hunt.	6	1	6
51	 The hunt?	6	1	6
52	 Killing things clears my head.	6	1	6
53	 You'll have to sit on the throne while I'm away.	6	1	6
54	 You'll hate it more than I do.	6	1	6
55	 The Targaryen girl--	6	1	6
56	 seven hells, don't start with her again.	6	1	6
57	 The girl will die and I'll hear no more of it.	6	1	6
58	 Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again,	6	1	6
59	 I swear to the mother I'll pin the damned thing on Jaime Lannister.	6	1	6
60	 Khaleesi?	8	1	6
61	 Oh, Khaleesi!	8	1	6
62	 You're hurt.	8	1	6
63	 - Not too fast. - Come on, Dancer.	9	1	6
64	 When are you gonna tell him?	10	1	6
65	 Not now.	10	1	6
66	 - Blood for blood. -  Come on!	10	1	6
67	 You need to make the Lannisters pay for Jory and the others.	10	1	6
68	 -  You're talking about war. - I'm talking about justice.	10	1	6
69	 Only the Lord of Winterfell	10	1	6
70	 can call in the bannermen and raise an army.	10	1	6
71	 A Lannister put his spear through your father's leg.	10	1	6
72	 The Kingslayer rides for Casterly Rock where no one can touch him--	10	1	6
73	 you want me to march on Casterly Rock?	10	1	6
74	 - You're not a boy anymore. -  Come on.	10	1	6
75	 They attacked your father. They've already started the war.	10	1	6
76	 It's your duty to represent your House when your father can't.	10	1	6
77	 And it's not your duty, because it's not your House.	10	1	6
78	 Where's Bran?	10	1	6
79	 I don't know. It's not my House.	11	1	6
80	 Robb?	11	1	6
81	 All alone in the deep, dark woods.	11	1	6
82	 I'm not alone. My brother is with me.	11	1	6
83	 I don't see him.	11	1	6
84	 Got him hidden under your cloak?	11	1	6
85	 Ooh, that's a pretty pin.	11	1	6
86	 - Silver. - We'll take the pin	12	1	6
87	 and the horse. Get down.	12	1	6
88	 Be quick about it.	12	1	6
89	 I can't.	12	1	6
90	 The saddle-- the straps.	12	1	6
91	 What's wrong with you? You some kind of cripple?	12	1	6
92	 I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.	12	1	6
93	 If you don't let me be, I'll have you all killed!	12	1	6
94	 Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.	12	1	6
95	 The boy's worth nothing dead.	12	1	6
96	 Benjen Stark's own blood?	12	1	6
97	 Think what Mance would give us.	12	1	6
98	 Piss on Mance Rayder and piss on the North.	12	1	6
99	 We're going as far South as South goes.	12	1	6
100	 There ain't no White Walkers down in Dorne.	12	1	6
101	 Drop the knife!	12	1	6
102	 Let him go and I'll let you live.	12	1	6
103	 Robb.	13	1	6
104	 - Robb. - Shut up.	13	1	6
105	 Drop the blade!	13	1	6
106	 - No, don't. - Do it.	13	1	6
107	 Are you all right?	14	1	6
108	 Yes. It doesn't hurt.	14	1	6
109	 Tough little lad.	14	1	6
110	 In the Iron Islands, you're not a man until you've killed your first enemy.	14	1	6
111	 Well done.	14	1	6
112	 Have you lost your mind?	14	1	6
113	 What if you'd missed?	14	1	6
114	 He would have killed you and cut Bran's throat.	14	1	6
115	 - You don't have the right-- - To what, to save your brother's life?	14	1	6
116	 It was the only thing to do, so I did it.	14	1	6
117	 What about her?	14	1	6
118	 Give me my life, My Lord, and I'm yours.	14	1	6
119	 We'll keep her alive.	15	1	6
120	 Mord!	15	1	6
121	 Turnkey! Mord!	15	1	6
122	 Mord!	15	1	6
123	 Dwarf man making noise!	15	1	6
124	 How would you like to be rich?	15	1	6
125	 Dwarf man still making noise.	15	1	6
126	 My family is rich.	15	1	6
127	 We have gold, lots of gold.	16	1	6
128	 I'm prepared to give you lots of gold in--	16	1	6
129	 No gold!	16	1	6
130	 Well, I don't have it here.	16	1	6
131	 No gold.	16	1	6
132	 Fuck off.	16	1	6
133	 I don't want to practice today.	16	1	6
134	 No?	16	1	6
135	 They killed Jory.	16	1	6
136	 My father is hurt.	16	1	6
137	 I don't care about stupid wooden swords.	16	1	6
138	 You are troubled.	17	1	6
139	 - Yes. - Good!	17	1	6
140	 Trouble is the perfect time for training.	17	1	6
141	 When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens,	17	1	6
142	 this is not when fighting happens.	17	1	6
143	 I don't like dolls and k--	17	1	6
144	 You're not here.	17	1	6
145	 You're with your trouble.	17	1	6
146	 If you are with your trouble when fighting happens--	17	1	6
147	 --More trouble for you.	17	1	6
148	 Just so.	17	1	6
149	 How can you be quick as a snake...	17	1	6
150	 ...Or as quiet as a shadow...	17	1	6
151	 ...When you are somewhere else?	17	1	6
152	 You are fearing for your father, hmm?	18	1	6
153	 That is right.	18	1	6
154	 - Do you pray to the gods? - The old and the new.	18	1	6
155	 There is only one God	18	1	6
156	 and his name is Death.	18	1	6
157	 And there is only one thing we say to 	18	1	6

248	 I am a Lannister.	26	1	6
249	 Tyrion, son of Tywin!	26	1	6
250	 And of course, you have also heard the phrase,	26	1	6
251	" ""a Lannister always pays his debts."""	26	1	6
252	 If you deliver a message from me...	26	1	6
253	 to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt.	26	1	6
254	 I will owe you gold.	27	1	6
255	 If you deliver the message	27	1	6
256	 and I live, which I very much intend to do.	27	1	6
257	 What message?	27	1	6
258	 Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.	27	1	6
259	 You wish to confess your crimes?	27	1	6
260	 Yes, My Lady.	27	1	6
261	 I do, My Lady.	27	1	6
262	 The sky cells always break them.	27	1	6
263	 Speak, Imp.	27	1	6
264	 Meet your gods as an honest man.	27	1	6
265	 Where do I begin, my lords and ladies?	27	1	6
266	 I'm a vile man,	28	1	6
267	 I confess it.	28	1	6
268	 My crimes and sins are beyond counting.	28	1	6
269	 I have lied and cheated...	28	1	6
270	 gambled and whored.	28	1	6
271	 I'm not particularly good at violence,	28	1	6
272	 but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me.	28	1	6
273	 You want specifics, I suppose.	28	1	6
274	 When I was seven I saw a servant girl	28	1	6
275	 bathing in the river.	28	1	6
276	 I stole her robe.	28	1	6
277	 She was forced to return to the castle	28	1	6
278	 naked and in tears.	28	1	6
279	 If I close my eyes,	28	1	6
280	 I can still see her tits bouncing.	28	1	6
281	 When I was 10 I stuffed my Uncle's boots with goatshit.	28	1	6
282	 When confronted with my crime,	29	1	6
283	 I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged	29	1	6
284	 and I escaped justice.	29	1	6
285	 When I was 12	29	1	6
286	 I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew.	29	1	6
287	 I flogged the one-eyed snake.	29	1	6
288	 I skinned my sausage.	29	1	6
289	 I made the bald man cry	29	1	6
290	 into the turtle stew,	29	1	6
291	 which I do believe my sister ate.	29	1	6
292	 At least I hope she did.	29	1	6
293	 Once I brought a jackass and a honeycomb	29	1	6
294	 - into a brothel-- - Silence!	29	1	6
295	 What happened next?	29	1	6
296	 What do you think you're doing?	29	1	6
297	 Confessing my crimes.	29	1	6
298	 Lord Tyrion, you are accused	29	1	6
299	 of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed,	29	1	6
300	 and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband	29	1	6
301	 Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.	29	1	6
302	 Oh, I'm very sorry.	30	1	6
303	 I don't know anything about all that.	30	1	6
304	 You've had your little joke.	30	1	6
305	 I trust you enjoyed it.	30	1	6
306	 Mord, take him back to the dungeon.	30	1	6
307	 But this time find a smaller cell...	30	1	6
308	 With a steeper floor.	30	1	6
309	 Is this how justice	30	1	6
310	 is done in the Vale?	30	1	6
311	 You accuse me of crimes,	30	1	6
312	 I deny them, so you throw me into a cell	30	1	6
313	 to freeze and starve?	30	1	6
314	 Where is the King's Justice?	30	1	6
315	 I am accused and demand a trial!	30	1	6
316	 If you're tried and found guilty,	30	1	6
317	 then by the King's own laws you will pay with your life.	30	1	6
318	 I understand the law.	30	1	6
319	 We have no executioner in the Eyrie.	30	1	6
320	 Life is more elegant here.	31	1	6
321	 Open the moon door.	31	1	6
322	 You want a trial, My Lord Lannister.	31	1	6
323	 Very well.	31	1	6
324	 My son will listen to whatever you have to say,	31	1	6
325	 and you will hear his judgment.	31	1	6
326	 Then you will leave...	31	1	6
327	 By one door or the other.	31	1	6
328	 No need to bother Lord Robin.	31	1	6
329	 I demand a trial by combat.	31	1	6
330	 You have that right.	32	1	6
331	 My Lady, I beg the honor.	32	1	6
332	 Let me be your champion.	32	1	6
333	 The honor should be mine.	32	1	6
334	 For the love I bore your Lord husband,	32	1	6
335	 let me avenge his death.	32	1	6
336	 - I'll fight for you, My Lady. - It'll be my honor.	32	1	6
337	 - The honor should be mine. - Make the bad man fly!	32	1	6
338	 Ser Vardis...	32	1	6
339	 You're quiet.	32	1	6
340	 Don't you want to avenge my husband?	32	1	6
341	 With all my heart, My Lady.	32	1	6
342	 But the Imp is half my size.	32	1	6
343	 It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.	32	1	6
344	 Agreed.	32	1	6
345	 You demanded a trial by combat.	32	1	6
346	 Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you.	32	1	6
347	 My Lady,	32	1	6
348	 I will gladly fight the Imp's champion for you.	33	1	6
349	 I wouldn't be too glad, Ser.	33	1	6
350	 I name my brother Jaime Lannister.	33	1	6
351	 The Kingslayer	33	1	6
352	 is hundreds of miles from here.	33	1	6
353	 Send a raven for him. I'm happy to wait.	33	1	6
354	 The trial will be today.	33	1	6
355	 Do I have a volunteer?	33	1	6
356	 Anyone?	33	1	6
357	 Anyone?	33	1	6
358	 I think we can assume that no one is willing--	33	1	6
359	 I'll stand for the dwarf.	33	1	6
360	 More wine, Your Grace?	34	1	6
361	 - What was I saying? -  Simpler time.	34	1	6
362	 It was! It was. You're too young to remember.	34	1	6
363	 Wasn't it simpler, Selmy?	34	1	6
364	 - It was, Your Grace. - The enemy was right  in the open,	34	1	6
365	 vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation.	34	1	6
366	 Nothing like today.	34	1	6
367	 - It sounds exhilarating. - Exhilarating, yes.	34	1	6
368	 Not as exhilarating as those balls	34	1	6
369	 and masquerades you like to throw.	34	1	6
370	 You ever fuck a Riverlands girl?	34	1	6
371	 Once. I think.	34	1	6
372	 You think? I think you'd remember.	34	1	6
373	 Back in our day, you weren't a real man	34	1	6
374	 until you'd fucked one girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms	34	1	6
375	 and the Riverlands.	34	1	6
376	" - We used to call it ""making the eight."" - Those were some lucky girls."	35	1	6
377	 You ever make the eight, Barristan?	35	1	6
378	 I don't believe so, Your Grace.	35	1	6
379	 Those were the days.	35	1	6
380	 Which days, exactly?	35	1	6
381	 The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died?	35	1	6
382	 Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies	35	1	6
383	 because the voices in his head told him they deserved it?	35	1	6
384	 Or way before that, when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?	35	1	6
385	 Easy, boy.	35	1	6
386	 You might be my brother, but you're speaking to the King.	35	1	6
387	 I suppose it was all rather heroic...	35	1	6
388	 If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore	35	1	6
389	 to shove your prick inside and make the eight.	35	1	6
390	 More wine, Your Grace?	35	1	6
391	 They burned most everything in the 	36	1	6
392	 Our fields; Our granaries;	36	1	6
393	 our homes.	36	1	6
394	 They took our women, then they took 'em again.	36	1	6
395	 When they was done, they butchered them	36	1	6
396	 as if they was animals.	36	1	6
397	 They covered our children	36	1	6
398	 in pitch	36	1	6
399	 and lit them on fire.	36	1	6
400	 Brigands, most likely.	36	1	6
401	 They weren't thieves.	36	1	6
402	 They didn't steal nothing.	36	1	6
403	 They even left something behind, Your Grace.	36	1	6
404	 It's the King's Hand you're addressing, not the King.	36	1	6
405	 The King is hunting.	36	1	6
406	 Fish. The Sigil of House Tully.	37	1	6
407	 Isn't that your wife's house-- Tully, My Lord Hand?	37	1	6
408	 These men, were they flying a Sigil?	37	1	6
409	 - A banner? - None, your--	37	1	6
410	 Hand.	37	1	6
411	 The one who was leading them...	37	1	6
412	 Taller by a foot than any man I've ever met,	37	1	6
413	 saw him cut the blacksmith in two,	37	1	6
414	 saw him take the head off a horse	37	1	6
415	 with a single swing of his sword.	37	1	6
416	 That sounds like someone we know.	37	1	6
417	 The Mountain.	37	1	6
418	 You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.	37	1	6
419	 Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand?	37	1	6
420	 The man is an anointed knight.	37	1	6
421	 I've heard him called Tywin Lannister's mad dog.	38	1	6
422	 I'm sure you have as well.	38	1	6
423	 Can you think of any reason	38	1	6
424	 the Lannisters might possibly have	38	1	6
425	 for being angry with your wife?	38	1	6
426	 Maester  If the Lannisters	38	1	6
427	 were to order attacks on villages	38	1	6
428	 under the King's protection,	38	1	6
429	 - it would be-- - That would be almost as brazen	38	1	6
430	 as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.	38	1	6
431	 Well...	38	1	6
432	 I cannot give you back your homes	38	1	6
433	 or restore your dead to life,	38	1	6
434	 but perhaps I can give you justice	38	1	6
435	 in the name of our King, Robert.	38	1	6
436	 Lord Beric Dondarrion.	38	1	6
437	 You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men	38	1	6
438	 - and ride to Ser Gregor's keep. - As you command.	38	1	6
439	 In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon,	39	1	6
440	 the first of his name,	39	1	6
441	 King of the Andals and the first men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms	39	1	6
442	 and protector of the realm,	39	1	6
443	 I charge you to bring the King's Justice	39	1	6
444	 to the false knight Gregor Clegane	39	1	6
445	 and all those who shared in his crimes.	39	1	6
446	 I denounce him	39	1	6
447	 and attaint him.	39	1	6
448	 I strip him of all ranks and titles,	39	1	6
449	 of all lands and holdings,	39	1	6
450	 - and sentence him to death. - My Lord...	39	1	6
451	 This-- this is a drastic action.	39	1	6
452	 It would be better to wait for King Robert's return.	39	1	6
453	 - Grand Maester Pycelle. - My Lord.	39	1	6
454	 Send a raven to Casterly Rock.	39	1	6
455	 Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court	39	1	6
456	 to answer for the crimes of his bannermen.	40	1	6
457	 He will arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the crown	40	1	6
458	 and a traitor to the realm.	40	1	6
459	 A bold move, My Lord, and admirable.	40	1	6
460	 But is it wise to yank the lion's tail?	40	1	6
461	 Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms.	40	1	6
462	 Gold wins wars, not soldiers.	40	1	6
463	 Then how come Robert is King	40	1	6
464	 and not Tywin Lannister?	40	1	6
465	 Hold!	41	1	6
466	 - Attack attack! - Come on, Ser Vardis!	41	1	6
467	 Attack!	41	1	6
468	 Stand and fight, coward!	41	1	6
469	 Yes!	42	1	6
470	 Enough, Ser Vardis! Finish him.	43	1	6
471	 What are you doing? Get up!	43	1	6
472	 Get up, get up, get up!	43	1	6
473	 Raise your sword. Raise it!	43	1	6
474	 Get up, man!	43	1	6
475	 - On your feet! - Get up!	43	1	6
476	 Get up and fight, Ser Vardis!	43	1	6
477	 No! Have mercy!	44	1	6
478	 Is it over?	44	1	6
479	 You don't fight with honor!	44	1	6
480	 No.	44	1	6
481	 He did.	44	1	6
482	 Can I make the little man fly now?	45	1	6
483	 Not this little man.	45	1	6
484	 This little man is going home.	45	1	6
485	 I believe you have something of mine.	45	1	6
486	 A Lannister always pays his debts.	45	1	6
487	 You wear your hair like a real southern lady now.	46	1	6
488	 Well, why shouldn't I? We're in the South.	46	1	6
489	 It's important to remember where you come from.	46	1	6
490	 I'm not sure your mother would like these new styles.	46	1	6
491	 My mother isn't from the North.	46	1	6
492	 I'm aware of that.	46	1	6
493	 Why do you care?	46	1	6
494	 Do you even have hair under there?	46	1	6
495	 Yes. I have hair.	46	1	6
496	 I've never seen it.	46	1	6
497	 Would you like to?	46	1	6
498	 No.	46	1	6
499	 Where are you from anyway? The North or the South?	46	1	6
500	 I come from a very small village in--	46	1	6
501	 Oh, wait.	47	1	6
502	 I just realized I don't care.	47	1	6
503	 - Sansa-- - Septa.	47	1	6
504	 Now you are being rude.	47	1	6
505	 My prince.	47	1	6
506	 My prince.	47	1	6
507	 My Lady.	47	1	6
508	 I fear I have behaved monstrously	47	1	6
509	 the past few weeks.	47	1	6
510	 With your permission?	47	1	6
511	 It's beautiful,	47	1	6
512	 like the one your mother wears.	47	1	6
513	 You'll be queen someday.	47	1	6
514	 It's only fitting you should look the part.	48	1	6
515	 Will you forgive me for my rudeness?	48	1	6
516	 There's nothing to forgive.	48	1	6
517	 You're My Lady.	48	1	6
518	 One day we'll be married in the throne room.	48	1	6
519	 Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come,	48	1	6
520	 from the last hearth in the North	48	1	6
521	 to the Salt Shore in the South,	48	1	6
522	 and you will be Queen over all of them.	48	1	6
523	 I'll never disrespect you again.	48	1	6
524	 I'll never be cruel to you again.	48	1	6
525	 Do you understand me?	48	1	6
526	 You're My Lady now,	48	1	6
527	 from this day	48	1	6
528	 until my last day.	49	1	6
529	 Stop.	49	1	6
530	 - Stop! - Whoa.	49	1	6
531	 - What are you doing? - Going to King's Landing.	49	1	6
532	 In a turnip cart?	49	1	6
533	 I'll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.	49	1	6
534	 And you can afford that?	49	1	6
535	 Some of my friends are more generous than others.	49	1	6
536	 There's a thousand girls like you in King's Landing.	49	1	6
537	 So I'll have lots of company.	49	1	6
538	 Yes, you'll be very popular...	49	1	6
539	 Until some fat lord comes to visit	50	1	6
540	 with a big belly and a little prick	50	1	6
541	 and he can't get it up so he knocks all your teeth out.	50	1	6
542	 And what will happen to me if I stay here?	50	1	6
543	 Will I become Lady Greyjoy,	50	1	6
544	 - mistress of the Iron Islands? - Don't be a fool.	50	1	6
545	 I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark	50	1	6
546	 in the streets of King's Landing.	50	1	6
547	 Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon	50	1	6
548	 and most of them will never come back.	50	1	6
549	 There's nothing left for me here.	50	1	6
550	 Let's go, Stefon.	50	1	6
551	 Giddyup.	50	1	6
552	 Let me see it one more time!	50	1	6
553	 See what?	50	1	6
554	 I'm going to miss you.	50	1	6
555	 I know.	50	1	6
556	 I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.	51	1	6
557	 - What?! - Listen--	51	1	6
558	 - What about Joffrey? - Are you dying because of your leg?	51	1	6
559	 Is that why you're sending us home?	51	1	6
560	 What? No.	51	1	6
561	 Please, father. Please don't.	51	1	6
562	 You can't. I've got my lessons with Syrio.	51	1	6
563	 I'm finally getting good.	51	1	6
564	 This isn't a punishment.	51	1	6
565	 I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.	51	1	6
566	 Can we take Syrio back with us?	51	1	6
567	 Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher?	51	1	6
568	 I can't go.	51	1	6
569	 I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey.	51	1	6
570	 I love him and I'm meant to be his Queen	51	1	6
571	 - and have his babies. - Seven hells.	51	1	6
572	 When you're old enough,	51	1	6
573	 I'll make you a match with someone who's worthy of you,	51	1	6
574	 someone who's brave and gentle and strong--	51	1	6
575	 I don't want someone brave and gentle and strong. I want him!	51	1	6
576	 He'll be the greatest King that ever was, a golden lion,	52	1	6
577	 and I'll give him sons with beautiful blond hair.	52	1	6
578	 The lion'sot s Sigil, idiot.	52	1	6
579	 He's a stag, like his father.	52	1	6
580	 He is not. He's nothing like that old drunk King.	52	1	6
581	 Go on, girls. Get your Septa and start packing your things.	52	1	6
582	 - Wait! - Come on.	52	1	6
583	 But it's not fair!	52	1	6

0	 Your Grace.	3	6	10
1	 The trial will be getting under way soon.	3	6	10
2	 You got my money?	4	6	10
3	 Later. Go away.	4	6	10
4	 Grand Maester.	4	6	10
5	 Ser Loras Tyrell.	5	6	10
6	 Are you prepared to stand trial	5	6	10
7	 and profess your guilt or innocence before the Seven?	5	6	10
8	 There'll be no need for a trial.	5	6	10
9	 I confess before the Seven	5	6	10
10	 and freely admit to my crimes.	5	6	10
11	 To which crimes will you be confessing?	5	6	10
12	 All of them.	5	6	10
13	 I lay with other men	5	6	10
14	 including the traitor Renly Baratheon.	5	6	10
15	 I perjured myself before the gods.	5	6	10
16	 I am guilty of depravity...	5	6	10
17	 dishonesty,	5	6	10
18	 profligacy,	5	6	10
19	 and arrogance.	5	6	10
20	 I see that now.	5	6	10
21	 I humble myself before the Seven	5	6	10
22	 and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just.	5	6	10
23	 The gods' judgment is fierce,	6	6	10
24	 but also fair.	6	6	10
25	 The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves	6	6	10
26	 beyond the reach of justice.	6	6	10
27	 But the Mother shows her mercy	6	6	10
28	 to those who kneel before her.	6	6	10
29	 I take full responsibility for my many sins	6	6	10
30	 and unburden myself of my desires.	6	6	10
31	 My only remaining wish	6	6	10
32	 is to devote my life to the Seven.	6	6	10
33	 May I be a living example of their grace	6	6	10
34	 for others to witness.	6	6	10
35	 You understand fully	6	6	10
36	 what this means?	6	6	10
37	 I do.	6	6	10
38	 I will abandon the Tyrell name	6	6	10
39	 and all that goes with it.	6	6	10
40	 I will renounce my lordship and my claims on Highgarden.	7	6	10
41	 I will never marry	7	6	10
42	 and I will never father children.	7	6	10
43	 Brother Loras...	7	6	10
44	 ...I ask you to dedicate your life to the seven gods.	7	6	10
45	 Will you fight to defend your faith	7	6	10
46	 against heretics and apostates?	7	6	10
47	 I will.	7	6	10
48	 No, I can't let them...	7	6	10
49	 Faith is the way, Father.	7	6	10
50	 All right.	8	6	10
51	 I'm ready.	8	6	10
52	 I have to go. I'm...	8	6	10
53	 I'm late for the trial.	8	6	10
54	 You mutilated him.	8	6	10
55	 You gave me your word.	8	6	10
56	 And I have kept my word.	8	6	10
57	 Once the queen mother's trial is concluded,	8	6	10
58	 Brother Loras is free to leave.	8	6	10
59	 And where is the queen mother?	8	6	10
60	 Her litter never left the Red Keep.	8	6	10
61	 It appears the queen mother doesn't wish to attend her own trial.	8	6	10
62	 Go to the Red Keep and show her the way.	9	6	10
63	 Get the others.	9	6	10
64	 Where's the king?	10	6	10
65	 Elsewhere, I'm afraid.	10	6	10
66	 What's the meaning of this?	10	6	10
67	 I was told that...	10	6	10
68	 I have more important things to do with my time	10	6	10
69	 than waste them in the presence...	10	6	10
70	 Please, Grand Maester. I bear you no ill will.	10	6	10
71	 Please forgive me if you can.	10	6	10
72	 This pains me, my lord.	10	6	10
73	 Whatever your faults, you do not deserve	10	6	10
74	 to die alone in such a cold, dark place.	10	6	10
75	 But sometimes before we can usher in the new,	11	6	10
76	 the old must be put to rest.	11	6	10
77	 The longer you wait, the worse it'll be for you.	11	6	10
78	 What are you doing?	12	6	10
79	 There's something wrong.	13	6	10
80	 You have nothing to fear, Your Grace.	13	6	10
81	 The trial will begin shortly.	13	6	10
82	 Cersei is not here. Tommen is not here.	13	6	10
83	 Why do you think they're not here?	13	6	10
84	 If the accused is not here,	13	6	10
85	 she will be tried regardless.	13	6	10
86	 We cannot escape the justice of the gods...	13	6	10
87	 Forget about the bloody gods and listen to what I'm telling you!	13	6	10
88	 Cersei understands the consequences of her absence	13	6	10
89	 and she is absent anyway,	13	6	10
90	 which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences.	13	6	10
91	 The trial can wait. We all need to leave.	13	6	10
92	 We all need to leave now!	14	6	10
93	 Loras.	14	6	10
94	 Stay with me.	14	6	10
95	 Let me through. Let me through.	14	6	10
96	 Get out of my way.	14	6	10
97	 Let us through.	14	6	10
98	 Confess.	15	6	10
99	 Confess.	16	6	10
100	 - No. - Confess.	16	6	10
101	 Confess. It felt good.	16	6	10
102	 Beating me, starving me,	16	6	10
103	 frightening me, humiliating me.	16	6	10
104	 You didn't do it because you cared about my atonement.	16	6	10
105	 You did it because it felt good.	16	6	10
106	 I understand.	16	6	10
107	 I do things because they feel good.	16	6	10
108	 I drink because it feels good.	16	6	10
109	 I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him.	16	6	10
110	 I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me.	16	6	10
111	 I lie about fucking my brother...	16	6	10
112	 because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites.	16	6	10
113	 I killed your High Sparrow...	17	6	10
114	 and all his little sparrows...	17	6	10
115	 all his septons, all his septas,	17	6	10
116	 all his filthy soldiers,	17	6	10
117	 because it felt good to watch them burn.	17	6	10
118	 It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain.	17	6	10
119	 No thought has ever given me greater joy.	17	6	10
120	 Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances.	17	6	10
121	 You've always been quiet.	17	6	10
122	 I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died.	17	6	10
123	 Do you remember?	17	6	10
124	 Good.	17	6	10
125	 I'm glad to see your face.	17	6	10
126	 I'm ready to meet the gods.	18	6	10
127	 What?	18	6	10
128	 Now?	18	6	10
129	 Today?	18	6	10
130	 You're not going to die today.	18	6	10
131	 You're not going to die for quite a while.	18	6	10
132	 Ser Gregor.	18	6	10
133	 This is Ser Gregor Clegane.	18	6	10
134	 He's quiet, too.	18	6	10
135	 Your gods have forsaken you.	18	6	10
136	 This is your god now.	18	6	10
137	 No.	18	6	10
138	 No.	18	6	10
139	 Shame.	18	6	10
140	 Shame.	19	6	10
141	 Shame.	19	6	10
142	 I'm very sorry, Your Grace.	19	6	10
143	 Very sorry.	19	6	10
144	 For House Lannister!	19	6	10
145	 Hear me roar!	19	6	10
146	 For House Frey!	20	6	10
147	 We stand together!	20	6	10
148	 May we stand together through the centuries,	20	6	10
149	 good friends to the last.	20	6	10
150	 And when we drive our swords through our enemies' hearts,	20	6	10
151	 may we speak the words of our alliance,	20	6	10
152	" ""The Freys and the Lannisters"	20	6	10
153	" send their regards."""	20	6	10
154	 You don't even have to do anything, do you?	20	6	10
155	 You just sit there, a rich slab of beef,	20	6	10
156	 and all the birds come pecking.	20	6	10
157	 - You're welcome to her. - She doesn't want me.	20	6	10
158	 She wants your golden fingers up her twat.	20	6	10
159	 Those two have their eyes on you.	20	6	10
160	 They have their eyes on you, cunt.	20	6	10
161	 Not my type.	20	6	10
162	 Not blonde enough?	20	6	10
163	 Ladies, have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,	21	6	10
164	 hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay?	21	6	10
165	 - There you go. - Maybe I'm not in the mood.	21	6	10
166	 Fuck it.	21	6	10
167	 No need to call me ser just because I'm an anointed knight.	21	6	10
168	 This came together rather well.	21	6	10
169	 Your father would be pleased.	21	6	10
170	 I'm sure he would be.	21	6	10
171	 Edmure is back in a cell.	21	6	10
172	 Can't go killing my son by law. It wouldn't be right.	21	6	10
173	 Give the family a bad name.	21	6	10
174	 So the famous Blackfish killed by foot soldiers, eh?	21	6	10
175	 Legendary warrior, everyone said.	21	6	10
176	 Have you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey?	21	6	10
177	 I'm a bit old for all that.	21	6	10
178	 No, but back in your day.	21	6	10
179	 The purpose of fighting	21	6	10
180	 is defeating your enemies, isn't it?	21	6	10
181	 I've defeated mine.	22	6	10
182	 Riverrun belonged to House Tully for a thousand years.	22	6	10
183	 Now it's mine.	22	6	10
184	 What do you call that?	22	6	10
185	 Victory.	22	6	10
186	 Yes, you're a great conqueror.	22	6	10
187	 Go on, mock me, boy. You think I mind?	22	6	10
188	 The Tullys mocked me for years.	22	6	10
189	 The Starks mocked me.	22	6	10
190	 Where are they now?	22	6	10
191	 You talk about war as if you're an expert,	22	6	10
192	 but the one battle I remember you fighting,	22	6	10
193	 you were captured by Robb Stark, the Young Wolf.	22	6	10
194	 But it doesn't matter.	22	6	10
195	 Here we are now, two kingslayers.	22	6	10
196	 We know what it's like to have them grovel to our faces	22	6	10
197	 and snigger behind our backs.	22	6	10
198	 We don't mind, do we?	22	6	10
199	 Fear is a marvelous thing.	22	6	10
200	 They don't fear the Freys, though.	22	6	10
201	 They fear the Lannisters.	22	6	10
202	 We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands.	22	6	10
203	 If we have to ride north and take them back for you	22	6	10
204	 every time you lose them,	22	6	10
205	 why do we need you?	22	6	10
206	 Show me.	23	6	10
207	 Your Grace, there's no need...	23	6	10
208	 Show me.	23	6	10
209	 What are your thoughts concerning the king's funeral?	23	6	10
210	 As the Sept of Baelor is no longer an option,	23	6	10
211	 perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?	23	6	10
212	 He should be with his grandfather,	23	6	10
213	 his brother, his sister.	23	6	10
214	 Burn him	23	6	10
215	 and bury his ashes where the sept once stood.	23	6	10
216	 Hello.	24	6	10
217	 From Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black.	24	6	10
218	 I'm...	25	6	10
219	 I'm to be the new maester.	25	6	10
220	 According to our records,	25	6	10
221	 Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander.	25	6	10
222	 He died.	25	6	10
223	 We received no report from the maester at Castle Black.	25	6	10
224	 Maester Aemon became quite ill shortly after the election.	25	6	10
225	 He's since passed away.	25	6	10
226	 Jon Snow will go to Uploaded By GOTA-FC Team	25	6	10
227	 Which is why I'm here.	25	6	10
228	 This is irregular.	25	6	10
229	 Yes, well...	25	6	10
230	 I suppose that life is irregular.	25	6	10
231	 The archmaester will discuss these irregularities with you.	26	6	10
232	 In the meantime, you are permitted to use the library.	26	6	10
233	 Follow me.	26	6	10
234	 No women or children.	26	6	10
235	 When we had feasts,	27	6	10
236	 our family would sit up here...	28	6	10
237	 and I'd sit down there.	28	6	10
238	 Could have been worse, Jon Snow.	28	6	10
239	 You had a family.	28	6	10
240	 You had feasts.	28	6	10
241	 Aye, you're right. I was luckier than most.	28	6	10
242	 What is that?	28	6	10
243	 Tell him.	28	6	10
244	 Tell him who it belonged to.	28	6	10
245	 The Princess Shireen.	28	6	10
246	 Tell him what you did to her.	28	6	10
247	 Tell him!	28	6	10
248	 We burned her at the stake.	28	6	10
249	 Why?	29	6	10
250	 The army was trapped. The horses were dying.	29	6	10
251	 - It was the only way. - You burned a little girl alive!	29	6	10
252	 I only do what my Lord commands.	29	6	10
253	 If he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil.	29	6	10
254	 We are standing here because of him.	29	6	10
255	 Jon Snow is alive because the Lord willed it.	29	6	10
256	 I loved that girl like she was my own.	29	6	10
257	 She was good. She was kind. And you killed her!	29	6	10
258	 So did her father.	29	6	10
259	 So did her mother.	29	6	10
260	 Her own blood knew it was the only way.	29	6	10
261	 The only way for what?	29	6	10
262	 They all died anyway.	29	6	10
263	 You told everyone Stannis was the one.	29	6	10
264	 You had him believing it, all of them fooled.	29	6	10
265	 - And you lied. - I didn't lie.	29	6	10
266	 I was wrong.	30	6	10
267	 Aye, you were wrong.	30	6	10
268	 How many died because you were wrong?	30	6	10
269	 I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder.	30	6	10
270	 She admits to the crime.	30	6	10
271	 Do you have anything to say for yourself?	30	6	10
272	 I've been ready to die for many years.	30	6	10
273	 If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he's not.	30	6	10
274	 You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow.	30	6	10
275	 You know the great war is still to come.	30	6	10
276	 You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon.	30	6	10
277	 And you know I can help you win that war.	30	6	10
278	 Ride south today.	30	6	10
279	 If you return to the North,	30	6	10
280	 I'll have you hanged as a murderer.	30	6	10
281	 If you ever come back this way,	31	6	10
282	 I will execute you myself.	31	6	10
283	 I'm having the lord's chamber prepared for you.	31	6	10
284	 Mother and Father's room?	31	6	10
285	 You should take it.	31	6	10
286	 I'm not a Stark.	31	6	10
287	 You are to me.	32	6	10
288	 You're the Lady of Winterfell.	32	6	10
289	 You deserve it. We're standing here because of you.	32	6	10
290	 The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in.	32	6	10
291	 They came because of you.	32	6	10
292	 You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.	32	6	10
293	 - He did. - And you trust him?	32	6	10
294	 Only a fool would trust Littlefinger.	32	6	10
295	 I should have told you about him,	32	6	10
296	 about the Knights of the Vale.	32	6	10
297	 I'm sorry.	32	6	10
298	 We need to trust each other.	32	6	10
299	 We can't fight a war amongst ourselves.	32	6	10
300	 We have so many enemies now.	32	6	10
301	 Jon.	33	6	10
302	 A raven came from the Citadel.	33	6	10
303	 A white raven.	33	6	10
304	 Winter is here.	33	6	10
305	 Well, Father always promised, didn't he?	33	6	10
306	 The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne,	33	6	10
307	 he was assassinated.	33	6	10
308	 100 red scorpions, was it?	33	6	10
309	 You have nothing to fear from us, Lady Olenna.	33	6	10
310	 You murder your own prince,	33	6	10
311	 but you expect me to trust you?	33	6	10
312	 We invited you to Dorne because we needed your help.	33	6	10
313	 You came to Dorne because you needed our help.	33	6	10
314	 What is your name again?	34	6	10
315	 Barbaro?	34	6	10
316	 Obara.	34	6	10
317	 Obara. You look like an angry little boy.	34	6	10
318	 Don't presume to tell me what I need.	34	6	10
319	 Forgive my sister. What she lacks in diplomacy, she makes...	34	6	10
320	 Do shut up, dear. Anything from you?	34	6	10
321	 No? Good.	34	6	10
322	 Let the grown women speak.	34	6	10
323	 The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell.	34	6	10
324	 They have declared war on Dorne.	34	6	10
325	 We must be allies now if we wish to survive.	34	6	10
326	 Cersei stole the future from me.	34	6	10
327	 She killed my son.	34	6	10
328	 She killed my grandson.	34	6	10
329	 She killed my granddaughter.	34	6	10
330	 Survival is not what I'm after now.	34	6	10
331	 You're absolutely right.	34	6	10
332	 I chose the wrong words.	34	6	10
333	 It is not survival I offer.	34	6	10
334	 It is your heart's desire.	34	6	10
335	 And what is my heart's desire?	34	6	10
336	 Vengeance.	34	6	10
337	 Justice.	34	6	10
338	 Fire and blood.	35	6	10
339	 Your ships are nearly ready.	35	6	10
340	 I saw them painting the sails.	35	6	10
341	 I'm curious to see how the Dothraki do on the poison water.	35	6	10
342	 You're not coming with us.	35	6	10
343	 New strategy?	35	6	10
344	 You want the Second Sons to attack from the west coast?	35	6	10
345	 If we take Casterly Rock,	35	6	10
346	 the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit King's Landing.	35	6	10
347	 You're not going to Westeros.	35	6	10
348	 You're staying here with the Second Sons.	35	6	10
349	 There's finally peace in Meereen.	35	6	10
350	 You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders.	35	6	10
351	 Fuck Meereen.	35	6	10
352	 Fuck the people.	35	6	10
353	 I'm here for you, not them.	35	6	10
354	 You promised me.	35	6	10
355	" ""My sword is yours. My life is yours."""	35	6	10
356	 This is what I command.	35	6	10
357	 If I'm going to rule in Westeros,	35	6	10
358	 I'll need to make alliances.	36	6	10
359	 The best way to make alliances is with marriage.	36	6	10
360	 Who are you marrying this time?	36	6	10
361	 I don't know. Maybe no one.	36	6	10
362	 But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table?	36	6	10
363	 Are you a queen or fish bait?	36	6	10
364	 I can't bring a lover to Westeros.	36	6	10
365	 A king wouldn't think twice about it.	36	6	10
366	 So that's what you want? To be my mistress?	36	6	10
367	 I'm not proud. I don't care what perfumed aristocrat	36	6	10
368	 sits beside you in the throne room.	36	6	10
369	 I don't want a crown. I want you.	36	6	10
370	 I love you.	36	6	10
371	 And I make you happy.	36	6	10
372	 You know I do.	36	6	10
373	 Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.	36	6	10
374	 I can't.	36	6	10
375	 The dwarf told you to do this?	37	6	10
376	 No one tells me to do anything.	37	6	10
377	 Clever fellow. Can't argue with his logic.	37	6	10
378	 I'm no use to you over there.	37	6	10
379	 Don't get angry.	37	6	10
380	 I'm not angry. I'm full of self-pity.	37	6	10
381	 Who comes after you?	37	6	10
382	 Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?	37	6	10
383	 A great number of women, I imagine.	37	6	10
384	 Specific orders will be left for you	37	6	10
385	 regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons.	37	6	10
386	 Bay of Dragons?	37	6	10
387	 We can't call it Slaver's Bay anymore, can we?	37	6	10
388	 You'll get that throne you want so badly, I'm sure of it.	37	6	10
389	 I hope it brings you happiness.	37	6	10
390	 I pity the lords of Westeros.	37	6	10
391	 They have no idea what's coming for them.	37	6	10
392	 Farewell, Daario Naharis.	37	6	10
393	 How did he take it?	38	6	10
394	 No tears.	38	6	10
395	 I know it was hard for you.	38	6	10
396	 You turned away a man who truly loves you	38	6	10
397	 because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms.	38	6	10
398	 That's the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler,	38	6	10
399	 if it's any consolation.	38	6	10
400	 It's not.	38	6	10
401	 No, I suppose not.	38	6	10
402	 I'm terrible at consoling.	38	6	10
403	 Yes, you really are.	38	6	10
404	 All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening?	38	6	10
405	 You have your armies, you have your ships,	38	6	10
406	 you have your dragons.	38	6	10
407	 Everything you've ever wanted	38	6	10
408	 since you were old enough to want anything,	39	6	10
409	 it's all yours for the taking.	39	6	10
410	 Are you afraid?	39	6	10
411	 Good.	39	6	10
412	 You're in the great game now.	39	6	10
413	 And the great game's terrifying.	39	6	10
414	 The only people who aren't afraid of failure	39	6	10
415	 are madmen like your father.	39	6	10
416	 Do you know what frightens me?	39	6	10
417	 I said farewell to a man who loves me.	39	6	10
418	 A man I thought I cared for.	39	6	10
419	 And I felt nothing.	39	6	10
420	 Just impatient to get on with it.	39	6	10
421	 He wasn't the first to love you	39	6	10
422	 and he won't be the last.	39	6	10
423	 Well, you have completely failed to console me.	39	6	10
424	 For what it's worth, I've been a cynic for as long as I can remember.	39	6	10
425	 Everyone's always asking me to believe in things...	40	6	10
426	 family, gods, kings, myself.	40	6	10
427	 It was often tempting	40	6	10
428	 until I saw where belief got people.	40	6	10
429	 So I said no, thank you to belief.	40	6	10
430	 And yet here I am.	40	6	10
431	 I believe in you.	40	6	10
432	 It's embarrassing, really.	40	6	10
433	 I'd swear you my sword,	40	6	10
434	 but I don't actually own a sword.	40	6	10
435	 It's your counsel I need.	40	6	10
436	 It's yours.	40	6	10
437	 Now and always.	40	6	10
438	 Good.	40	6	10
439	 I...	40	6	10
440	 I had something made for you.	40	6	10
441	 I'm not sure if it's right.	40	6	10
442	 Tyrion Lannister,	40	6	10
443	 I name you Hand of the Queen.	40	6	10
444	 You're not one of mine, are you?	41	6	10
445	 No, my lord.	41	6	10
446	 Didn't think so.	41	6	10
447	 Too pretty.	41	6	10
448	 Where are my damn moron sons?!	41	6	10
449	 Black Walder and Lothar promised to be here by midday.	41	6	10
450	 They're here, my lord.	41	6	10
451	 Well, what are they doing, trimming their cunt hairs?	41	6	10
452	 Tell them to come here now.	41	6	10
453	 But they're already here, my lord.	41	6	10
454	 Here, my lord.	41	6	10
455	 They weren't easy to carve.	42	6	10
456	 Especially Black Walder.	42	6	10
457	 What...	42	6	10
458	 My name is Arya Stark.	42	6	10
459	 I want you to know that.	42	6	10
460	 The last thing you're ever going to see	42	6	10
461	 is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.	42	6	10
462	 Forgive me, my lady...	43	6	10
463	 if you're at prayer.	43	6	10
464	 I'm done with all that.	43	6	10
465	 I came here every day when I was a girl.	43	6	10
466	 I prayed to be somewhere else.	43	6	10
467	 Back then I only thought about what I wanted, never about what I had.	43	6	10
468	 I was a stupid girl.	43	6	10
469	 You were a child.	43	6	10
470	 What do you want?	43	6	10
471	 I thought you knew what I wanted.	43	6	10
472	 I was wrong.	43	6	10
473	 No, you weren't.	43	6	10
474	 Every time I'm faced with a decision,	44	6	10
475	 I close my eyes and see the same picture.	44	6	10
476	 Whenever I consider an action, I ask myself	44	6	10
477	 will this action help to make this picture a reality?	44	6	10
478	 Pull it out of my mind	44	6	10
479	 and into the world?	44	6	10
480	 And I only act if the answer is yes.	44	6	10
481	 A picture of me...	44	6	10
482	 on the Iron Throne...	44	6	10
483	 and you by my side.	44	6	10
484	 It's a pretty picture.	44	6	10
485	 News of this battle will spread quickly through the Seven Kingdoms.	44	6	10
486	 I've declared for House Stark for all to hear.	44	6	10
487	 You've declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish.	44	6	10
488	 It's never stopped you from serving yourself.	44	6	10
489	 The past is gone for good.	45	6	10
490	 You can sit here mourning its departure	45	6	10
491	 or you can prepare for the future.	45	6	10
492	 You, my love,	45	6	10
493	 are the future of House Stark.	45	6	10
494	 Who should the North rally behind?	45	6	10
495	 A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark	45	6	10
496	 born here at Winterfell	45	6	10
497	 or a motherless bastard born in the south?	45	6	10
498	 This is where I leave you.	45	6	10
499	 You're not coming with us?	45	6	10
500	 The Wall is not just ice and stone.	45	6	10
501	 Ancient spells were carved into its foundations.	45	6	10
502	 Strong magic	45	6	10
503	 to protect men from what lies beyond.	46	6	10
504	 And while it stands, the dead cannot pass.	46	6	10
505	 I cannot pass.	46	6	10
506	 Where will you go?	46	6	10
507	 The great war is coming	46	6	10
508	 and I still fight for the living.	46	6	10
509	 I'll do what I can...	46	6	10
510	 as long as I can.	46	6	10
511	 Thank you, Uncle Benjen.	46	6	10
512	 I wish you both good fortune.	46	6	10
513	 Are you sure you're ready for this?	47	6	10
514	 I'm the Three-Eyed Raven now.	47	6	10
515	 I have to be ready for this.	47	6	10
516	 Ned?	47	6	10
517	 Lyanna.	47	6	10
518	 Is that you?	47	6	10
519	 Is that really you?	48	6	10
520	 You're not a dream?	48	6	10
521	 No, I'm not a dream.	48	6	10
522	 I'm here.	48	6	10
523	 Right here.	48	6	10
524	 I've missed you, big brother.	48	6	10
525	 I've missed you, too.	48	6	10
526	 I want to be brave.	48	6	10
527	 You are.	48	6	10
528	 I'm not.	48	6	10
529	 I don't want to die.	48	6	10
530	 You're not going to die.	48	6	10
531	 Get her some water!	48	6	10
532	 - No, no water. - Is there a maester?	48	6	10
533	 Listen to me, Ned.	48	6	10
534	 _	48	6	10
535	 If Robert finds out, he'll...	48	6	10
536	 you know he will.	49	6	10
537	 You have to protect him.	49	6	10
538	 Promise me, Ned.	49	6	10
539	 Promise me.	49	6	10
540	 Promise me, Ned.	49	6	10
541	 Promise me.	49	6	10
542	 You can't expect Knights of the Vale	49	6	10
543	 to side with wildling invaders.	49	6	10
544	 We didn't invade. We were invited.	50	6	10
545	 Not by me.	50	6	10
546	 The free folk, the northerners,	50	6	10
547	 and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely,	50	6	10
548	 fought together, and we won.	50	6	10
549	 My father used to say we find our true friends on the battlefield.	50	6	10
550	 The Boltons are defeated.	50	6	10
551	 The war is over.	50	6	10
552	 Winter has come.	50	6	10
553	 If the maesters are right, it'll be the coldest one in a thousand years.	50	6	10
554	 We should ride home and wait out the coming storms.	50	6	10
555	 The war is not over.	50	6	10
556	 And I promise you, friend,	50	6	10
557	 the true enemy won't wait out the storm.	50	6	10
558	 He brings the storm.	50	6	10
559	 Your son was butchered at the Red Wedding, Lord Manderly,	50	6	10
560	 but you refused the call.	50	6	10
561	 You swore allegiance to House Stark, Lord Glover,	51	6	10
562	 but in their hour of greatest need,	51	6	10
563	 you refused the call.	51	6	10
564	 And you, Lord Cerwyn,	51	6	10
565	 your father was skinned alive by Ramsay Bolton.	51	6	10
566	 Still you refused the call.	51	6	10
567	 But House Mormont remembers.	51	6	10
568	 The North remembers.	51	6	10
569	 We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.	51	6	10
570	 I don't care if he's a bastard.	51	6	10
571	 Ned Stark's blood runs through his veins.	51	6	10
572	 He's my king from this day until his last day.	51	6	10
573	 Lady Mormont speaks harshly	51	6	10
574	 and truly.	51	6	10
575	 My son died for Robb Stark, the Young Wolf.	52	6	10
576	 I didn't think we'd find another king in my lifetime.	52	6	10
577	 I didn't commit my men to your cause	52	6	10
578	 'cause I didn't want more Manderlys dying for nothing.	52	6	10
579	 But I was wrong.	52	6	10
580	 Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding.	52	6	10
581	 He is the White Wolf.	52	6	10
582	 The King in the North.	52	6	10
583	 I did not fight beside you on the field	52	6	10
584	 and I will regret that until my dying day.	52	6	10
585	 A man can only admit when he was wrong	52	6	10
586	 and ask forgiveness.	52	6	10
587	 There's nothing to forgive, my lord.	52	6	10
588	 There will be more fights to come.	52	6	10
589	 House Glover will stand behind House Stark	52	6	10
590	 as we have for a thousand years.	52	6	10
591	 And I will stand behind Jon Snow...	53	6	10
592	 the King in the North!	53	6	10
593	 The King in the North!	53	6	10
594	 The King in the North! The King in the North!	53	6	10
595	 Company halt!	53	6	10
596	 Halt!	53	6	10
597	 Halt!	53	6	10
598	 Come on.	54	6	10
599	 I now proclaim Cersei of the House Lannister	54	6	10
600	 First of Her Name,	55	6	10
601	 Queen of the Andals and the First Men,	55	6	10
602	 Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.	55	6	10
603	 Long may she reign.	55	6	10
604	 Long may she reign.	55	6	10
605		0	6	10
0	 ( theme music playing )	0	4	3
1		1	4	3
2	 You did this. You did this!	2	4	3
3	 - We have to leave. -  Take him! Take him!	2	4	3
4	 Where is his wife?	2	4	3
5	 Where's Sansa?	2	4	3
6	 Find her. Bar the gates of the city.	2	4	3
7	 Seize every ship in the harbor.	2	4	3
8	 - Where is she?! - No one leaves the capital!	2	4	3
9	 No one!	2	4	3
10	 ( bells tolling )	2	4	3
11	 - Get in. - Where are we going?	2	4	3
12	 Somewhere safe.	2	4	3
13	 Up you go, my lady.	3	4	3
14	 You'll be fine.	3	4	3
15	 You're stronger than you know.	3	4	3
16	 ( gasps )	4	4	3
17	 - Lord Baelish? - Petyr.	4	4	3
18	 Are you hurt, my lady?	4	4	3
19	 Good. Good.	4	4	3
20	 I'm sure you've had quite a fright. Rest easy.	4	4	3
21	 - The worst is past. -  Lord Baelish.	4	4	3
22	 - I promised I'd get her to you safely. - Softly, my friend.	4	4	3
23	 Voices carry over water.	4	4	3
24	 I should get back before someone thinks to look for me.	4	4	3
25	 First you'll want your pay.	4	4	3
26	 - 10,000 was it? - 10,000.	4	4	3
27	 ( snaps fingers )	4	4	3
28	 Wait! ( groans )	4	4	3
29	 ( screams )	4	4	3
30	   Shh.	4	4	3
31	 You don't want the queen to hear, do you?	4	4	3
32	 1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you.	4	4	3
33	 And if they found you,	4	4	3
34	 how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?	5	4	3
35	 - I didn't murder anyone. - I know. I know.	5	4	3
36	 But you must admit it looks suspicious.	5	4	3
37	 The king who executed your father,	5	4	3
38	 who tormented you for years,	5	4	3
39	 and you fled the scene of his murder.	5	4	3
40	 Why did you kill him?	5	4	3
41	 Because he was a drunk and a fool	5	4	3
42	 and I don't trust drunk fools.	5	4	3
43	 He saved me.	5	4	3
44	 Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders.	5	4	3
45	 Every one of them. And he did it all for gold.	5	4	3
46	 Money buys a man's silence for a time.	5	4	3
47	 A bolt in the heart buys it forever.	5	4	3
48	 He was helping me because I saved his life.	5	4	3
49	 Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace	5	4	3
50	 that once belonged to his grandmother.	5	4	3
51	 The last legacy of House Hollard.	5	4	3
52	 I had it made a few weeks ago.	6	4	3
53	 What did I once tell you about the capital?	6	4	3
54	 We're all liars here.	6	4	3
55	 Come, my lady.	6	4	3
56	 I know you've had a difficult day.	6	4	3
57	 But you're safe now.	6	4	3
58	 I promise you that.	6	4	3
59	 You're safe with me	6	4	3
60	 and sailing home.	6	4	3
61	 So am I the queen?	6	4	3
62	 More than you were with Renly.	6	4	3
63	 Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy	6	4	3
64	 of consummating the marriage before dying.	6	4	3
65	 In any case, this would not be an opportune moment	6	4	3
66	 to press the issue.	6	4	3
67	 Clawing at his own throat,	6	4	3
68	 looking to his mother to make it stop-- it was horrible.	6	4	3
69	 The world is overflowing with horrible things.	7	4	3
70	 But they're all a tray of cakes next to death.	7	4	3
71	 They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know?	7	4	3
72	 Made me look at it.	7	4	3
73	 What was it like?	7	4	3
74	 They took me to the Great Hall and there he was.	7	4	3
75	 The man I'd married	7	4	3
76	 and suffered to father my children.	7	4	3
77	 A great doughy lump I'd sat next to	7	4	3
78	 at endless dinners and tedious gatherings.	7	4	3
79	 There he was...	7	4	3
80	 lying on a table.	7	4	3
81	 One of my husbands preferred the company of men	7	4	3
82	 and was stabbed through the heart.	7	4	3
83	 Another was happiest torturing animals	7	4	3
84	 and was poisoned at our wedding feast.	7	4	3
85	 - I must be cursed. - Nonsense.	7	4	3
86	 Your circumstances have improved markedly.	7	4	3
87	 You may not have enjoyed watching him die,	7	4	3
88	 but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed	7	4	3
89	 being married to him, I can promise you that.	8	4	3
90	 But I would have been the queen.	8	4	3
91	 Our alliance with the Lannisters	8	4	3
92	 remains every bit as necessary to them	8	4	3
93	 as it is unpleasant for us.	8	4	3
94	 You did wonderful work on Joffrey.	8	4	3
95	 The next one should be easier.	8	4	3
96	  Your brother is dead.	8	4	3
97	 Do you know what that means?	8	4	3
98	 I'm not trying to trick you.	8	4	3
99	 It means I'll become king.	8	4	3
100	 Yes, you will become king.	8	4	3
101	 What kind of king do you think you'll be?	8	4	3
102	 A good king?	8	4	3
103	 Mm, I think so as well.	8	4	3
104	 You've got the right temperament for it.	8	4	3
105	 But what makes a good king? Hmm?	9	4	3
106	 What is a good king's single most important quality?	9	4	3
107	 This is hardly the place or the time.	9	4	3
108	 Holiness?	9	4	3
109	 Hmm.	9	4	3
110	 Baelor the Blessed was holy.	9	4	3
111	 And pious.	9	4	3
112	 He built this sept.	9	4	3
113	 He also named a six-year-old boy high septon	9	4	3
114	 because he thought the boy could work miracles.	9	4	3
115	 He ended up fasting himself into an early grave	9	4	3
116	 because food was of this world	9	4	3
117	 and this world was sinful.	9	4	3
118	 Justice.	9	4	3
119	 Yeah.	9	4	3
120	 A good king must be just.	9	4	3
121	 Orys I was just.	9	4	3
122	 Everyone applauded his reforms.	9	4	3
123	 Nobles and commoners alike.	9	4	3
124	 But he wasn't just for long.	9	4	3
125	 He was murdered in his sleep	9	4	3
126	 after less than a year by his own brother.	10	4	3
127	 Was that truly just of him?	10	4	3
128	 To abandon his subjects to an evil	10	4	3
129	 that he was too gullible to recognize?	10	4	3
130	 - No. - No.	10	4	3
131	 - What about strength? - Yes.	10	4	3
132	 Strength.	10	4	3
133	 King Robert was strong.	10	4	3
134	 He won the rebellion	10	4	3
135	 and crushed the Targaryen dynasty.	10	4	3
136	 And he attended three small council meetings	10	4	3
137	 in 17 years.	10	4	3
138	 He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking	10	4	3
139	 until the last two killed him.	10	4	3
140	 So, we have a man who starves himself to death,	10	4	3
141	 a man who lets his own brother murder him,	10	4	3
142	 and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing.	10	4	3
143	 What do they all lack?	10	4	3
144	 - Wisdom. - Yes!	11	4	3
145	 Wisdom is what makes a good king.	11	4	3
146	 Yes.	11	4	3
147	 But what is wisdom? Hmm?	11	4	3
148	 A house with great wealth and fertile lands	11	4	3
149	 asks you for your protection	11	4	3
150	 against another house with a strong navy	11	4	3
151	 that could one day oppose you.	11	4	3
152	 How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't?	11	4	3
153	 You've any experience of treasuries and granaries	11	4	3
154	 or shipyards and soldiers?	11	4	3
155	 - No. - No. Of course not.	11	4	3
156	 A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't.	11	4	3
157	 You're young.	11	4	3
158	 A wise young king listens to his counselors	11	4	3
159	 and heeds their advice until he comes of age.	11	4	3
160	 And the wisest kings	11	4	3
161	 continue to listen to them long afterwards.	11	4	3
162	 Your brother was not a wise king.	12	4	3
163	 Your brother was not a good king.	12	4	3
164	 If he had been,	12	4	3
165	 perhaps he'd still be alive.	12	4	3
166	 Now, as the king, you will have to marry.	12	4	3
167	 Do you understand why?	12	4	3
168	  A king needs a queen.	12	4	3
169	  Yes, but why?	12	4	3
170	 To further the family line.	12	4	3
171	 - Do you know how that happens? - Yes.	12	4	3
172	 Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?	12	4	3
173	 I don't think so.	12	4	3
174	 It's all relatively straightforward.	12	4	3
175	 - How are you? - I'm all right.	12	4	3
176	 You are. You will be.	12	4	3
177	 I'll see to that.	12	4	3
178	 Please give the queen a moment alone with her son.	12	4	3
179	 - Yes, my lord. - All of you.	12	4	3
180	 ( snaps fingers )	12	4	3
181	 ( doors echo shut )	13	4	3
182	 It was Tyrion.	13	4	3
183	 He killed him.	13	4	3
184	 He told me he would.	13	4	3
185	" ""A day will come when you think you are safe and happy"	13	4	3
186	" and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth."""	13	4	3
187	 That's what he said to me.	13	4	3
188	 You saw it.	13	4	3
189	 You saw Joff point at him just before he--	13	4	3
190	 I don't know what I saw.	13	4	3
191	 Avenge him.	14	4	3
192	 Avenge our son.	14	4	3
193	 Kill Tyrion.	14	4	3
194	 Tyrion's my brother.	14	4	3
195	 Our brother.	14	4	3
196	 There'll be a trial. We'll get to the truth of what happened.	14	4	3
197	 I don't want a trial.	14	4	3
198	 He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance.	14	4	3
199	 I want him dead.	14	4	3
200	 ( crying ) Please, Jaime.	14	4	3
201	 You have to.	14	4	3
202	 He was our son.	14	4	3
203	 Our baby boy.	14	4	3
204	 ( gasps )	15	4	3
205	 You're a hateful woman.	15	4	3
206	 Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?	15	4	3
207	 Jaime, not here, please.	15	4	3
208	 Please.	15	4	3
209	 - ( fabric rips ) - Stop it.	15	4	3
210	 - Stop it. Stop. - No.	15	4	3
211	 Stop it. Stop.	15	4	3
212	 Stop.	15	4	3
213	 - Stop. It's not right. - ( Grunts )	16	4	3
214	 It's not right. It's not right.	16	4	3
215	 - I don't care. - ( Crying )	16	4	3
216	 - Don't. - I don't care.	16	4	3
217	 - Don't. Jaime, don't. - I don't care.	16	4	3
218	 ( thunder rumbles )	16	4	3
219	 Gonna rain soon.	16	4	3
220	 ( urinating )	16	4	3
221	 Where are we?	16	4	3
222	 Near Fairmarket, I think.	16	4	3
223	 You think?	16	4	3
224	 You don't have a map?	16	4	3
225	 -  No, I don't have a map. - Maybe we should get one.	16	4	3
226	 Just point out the next map shop you see and I'll buy you one.	16	4	3
227	 How far is it to the Eyrie?	16	4	3
228	 - Far. - And you're sure we're going the right way?	16	4	3
229	 Believe me, girl, I want you there as soon as I can.	16	4	3
230	 Get my gold, be on my way.	16	4	3
231	 - On your way where? - Why do you care?	16	4	3
232	 Might book passage across the Narrow Sea.	17	4	3
233	 Fight as a sellsword.	17	4	3
234	 Second Sons, could be. Seems like a good fit for me.	17	4	3
235	 I'd like to see Braavos one day.	17	4	3
236	 Why Braavos?	17	4	3
237	 I have friends there.	17	4	3
238	 ( blows ) I doubt it.	17	4	3
239	 Seven blessings to you.	17	4	3
240	 - What do you want? - What do I want? This is my land.	17	4	3
241	 If I'm standing on it, it's my land.	17	4	3
242	 We were just watering the horses. We'll be on our way.	17	4	3
243	 Forgive my father.	17	4	3
244	 He was wounded fighting in the war.	17	4	3
245	 Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it.	17	4	3
246	 He's never been the same.	17	4	3
247	 Which house did he fight for?	18	4	3
248	 The Tullys of Riverrun.	18	4	3
249	 There's a storm coming.	18	4	3
250	 You'll be wanting a roof tonight.	18	4	3
251	 There's fresh hay in the barn.	18	4	3
252	 And Sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do.	18	4	3
253	 We don't have much, but any man that bled	18	4	3
254	 for House Tully is welcome to it.	18	4	3
255	 -  ( thunder rumbling ) -  ( Rain pattering )	18	4	3
256	   We ask the Father to judge us with mercy	18	4	3
257	 accepting our human frailty.	18	4	3
258	 We ask the Mother to bless our crops	18	4	3
259	 so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door.	18	4	3
260	 We ask the Warrior to give us courage	18	4	3
261	 in these days of strife and turmoil.	18	4	3
262	 We ask the Maiden to protect Sally's virtue	18	4	3
263	 to keep her from the clutches of depravity.	18	4	3
264	 You got to do all seven of the fuckers?	18	4	3
265	 Father!	18	4	3
266	 We ask the Smith to strengthen our hands	19	4	3
267	 and our backs so we may finish the work required of us.	19	4	3
268	 We ask the Crone to guide us on our journey from darkness to darkness.	19	4	3
269	 And we ask the Stranger not to kill us	19	4	3
270	 in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all.	19	4	3
271	 I'm so sorry.	19	4	3
272	 ( slurping loudly )	19	4	3
273	 Really good.	19	4	3
274	 - Did you fight at the Twins? - Call that a fight?	19	4	3
275	 Slaughtering livestock more like.	19	4	3
276	 The Red Wedding they're calling it.	19	4	3
277	 Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day.	19	4	3
278	 He shared bread and salt with the Starks. He offered them guest right.	19	4	3
279	 Guest right don't mean much anymore.	20	4	3
280	 It means something to me.	20	4	3
281	 The gods will have their vengeance.	20	4	3
282	 Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did.	20	4	3
283	 Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands.	20	4	3
284	 We had good years and bad years, same as anyone.	20	4	3
285	 But we were safe. Now with the Freys,	20	4	3
286	 raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver.	20	4	3
287	 I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother,	20	4	3
288	 but the north's no better. The whole country's gone sour.	20	4	3
289	 You got any ale?	20	4	3
290	 Afraid not.	20	4	3
291	 How can a man not keep ale in his home?	20	4	3
292	 You look like you could really swing that sword.	20	4	3
293	 A real warrior with proper training.	20	4	3
294	 Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you.	20	4	3
295	 How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon?	20	4	3
296	 I could use a man to help with the farmwork.	20	4	3
297	 Sally does what she can,	21	4	3
298	 but she can't lift a bale of hay.	21	4	3
299	 And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings,	21	4	3
300	 one look at you, I'd bet they'd run the other way.	21	4	3
301	 Meaning no offense.	21	4	3
302	 What'll you pay?	21	4	3
303	 I don't have much.	21	4	3
304	 But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits.	21	4	3
305	 Fair wages for fair work?	21	4	3
306	 Fair wages for fair work.	21	4	3
307	 ( chickens clucking )	21	4	3
308	 ( faint voices arguing )	21	4	3

310	 ( girl screams )	22	4	3
311	 ( man groaning )	22	4	3
312	 - What did you do?! -  Get your horse saddled.	22	4	3
313	 - You told me you weren't a thief. - I wasn't.	22	4	3
314	 He took us in. He fed us and you--	22	4	3
315	 Aye, he took us in. He's a good man	22	4	3
316	 and his daughter makes a nice stew.	22	4	3
317	 And they'll both be dead come winter.	22	4	3
318	 - You don't know that. - I do know it.	22	4	3
319	 He's weak. He can't protect himself.	22	4	3
320	 They'll both be dead come winter.	22	4	3
321	 Dead men don't need silver.	22	4	3
322	 You're the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms.	22	4	3
323	 There's plenty worse than me.	22	4	3
324	 I just understand the way things are.	22	4	3
325	 How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out?	22	4	3
326	  Raper. Raper.	23	4	3
327	 Horse thief.	23	4	3
328	 Ninth born son.	23	4	3
329	 Raper.	23	4	3
330	 Thief. Thief and raper.	23	4	3
331	 There he is, Sam the Slayer.	23	4	3
332	 Going to visit your wildling whore?	23	4	3
333	 - She's not a whore. - No?	23	4	3
334	 Maybe I'll give her a copper tonight and find out.	23	4	3
335	 They all think I'm lying.	23	4	3
336	 About what?	23	4	3
337	 Killing the white walker.	23	4	3
338	 You're not lying.	23	4	3
339	 I'll never forget the way it screamed.	23	4	3
340	 But you're the only one that saw it.	23	4	3
341	 And they all think you're just a--	23	4	3
342	 A what?	23	4	3
343	 Well, a wildling.	23	4	3
344	 My father hated that word.	23	4	3
345	 It's not a very nice word, I suppose.	23	4	3
346	 I don't know.	23	4	3
347	 It makes me sound a bit dangerous, doesn't it?	23	4	3
348	 So...	24	4	3
349	 are you all right?	24	4	3
350	 No one bothering you?	24	4	3
351	 I get a lot of looks.	24	4	3
352	 I hear them making their jokes.	24	4	3
353	 But no one's touched me if that's what you mean.	24	4	3
354	 I worry about it sometimes.	24	4	3
355	 All the time.	24	4	3
356	 Why do you worry about it?	24	4	3
357	 100 men, one woman.	24	4	3
358	 I've got other things to think about.	24	4	3
359	 That's the only thing they think about.	24	4	3
360	 - You're being silly. - I'm not being silly.	24	4	3
361	 There's 100 men lying awake at night picturing you.	24	4	3
362	 What about you?	24	4	3
363	 What about me?	24	4	3
364	 Gilly?	25	4	3
365	 I worry about you.	25	4	3
366	 Thank you.	25	4	3
367	 For what?	25	4	3
368	 For worrying about me.	25	4	3
369	 I don't know if you're safe here.	25	4	3
370	 They're my brothers,	25	4	3
371	 but some of them were thieves before they came here.	25	4	3
372	 Some of them were rapers.	25	4	3
373	 You saw what they did at your father's keep.	25	4	3
374	 So what are you saying?	25	4	3
375	 Maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.	25	4	3
376	 Are you bored of me?	25	4	3
377	 Bored of you?	26	4	3
378	 I...	26	4	3
379	 I want to protect you.	26	4	3
380	 I'll get these to Hobb.	26	4	3
381	 Keep an eye on little Sam.	26	4	3
382	 ( door closes )	26	4	3
383	 ( thunder rumbling )	26	4	3
384	 Your Grace.	26	4	3
385	 You're a literary man now. What do you make of that?	26	4	3
386	 - Joffrey? - The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.	27	4	3
387	 I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire.	27	4	3
388	 A leech filled with bastard blood.	27	4	3
389	 A bastard you set free.	27	4	3
390	 I am now faced with a great opportunity	27	4	3
391	 and I am powerless to take advantage of it.	27	4	3
392	 I will find you an army, Your Grace.	27	4	3
393	 - I've been working day and night-- - What progress have you made?	27	4	3
394	 I've rallied House Peasebury to your cause.	27	4	3
395	 House Peasebury.	27	4	3
396	 - House Musgood. - House Musgood.	27	4	3
397	 - And House Haigh. - House Haigh.	27	4	3
398	 ( pieces clatter )	27	4	3
399	 They don't have enough men between them to raid a pantry.	27	4	3
400	 Westeros is not the world, Your Grace.	27	4	3
401	 We need to look east for ships and men.	27	4	3
402	 10,000 skilled soldiers fight for the Golden Company.	27	4	3
403	 - The Golden Company? - They've never broken a contract.	28	4	3
404	 They're sellswords.	28	4	3
405	 We're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne,	28	4	3
406	 but we're not willing to pay men to fight?	28	4	3
407	 Now the Red Woman's magic is real.	28	4	3
408	 Her visions and prophecies may be, too,	28	4	3
409	 but I've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war.	28	4	3
410	 Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground.	28	4	3
411	 It's dirty on the ground.	28	4	3
412	 We don't have any gold.	28	4	3
413	 Not yet.	28	4	3
414	 If I do not press my claim,	28	4	3
415	 my claim will be forgotten.	28	4	3
416	 I will not become a page in someone else's history book.	28	4	3
417	 I'm running out of time, Ser Davos.	28	4	3
418	 Which means you're running out of time.	28	4	3
419	 ( knocking )	28	4	3
420	 You're late.	28	4	3
421	 I'm sorry, Princess.	28	4	3
422	 I thought you weren't coming.	28	4	3
423	 The Hand of the King doesn't have much leisure time.	28	4	3

425	 That happened once, weeks ago.	28	4	3
426	 You're your father's daughter, no mistake.	29	4	3
427	 Bloody relentless, the both of you.	29	4	3
428	 It's a new one today. Lots of tricky words.	29	4	3
429	 But I think you can manage.	29	4	3
430	 You'll never read well if you move your lips.	29	4	3

433	" First Sword of Braavos."""	29	4	3
434	 - ( claps ) - Thank you very much.	29	4	3
435	 I like this one. It's full of sword fights and pirates.	29	4	3
436	 You were a pirate once.	29	4	3
437	 No, I was never a pirate. I was a smuggler.	29	4	3
438	 What's the difference?	29	4	3
439	 Well, if you're a famous smuggler,	29	4	3
440	 you're not doing it right.	29	4	3
441	 My father says a criminal is a criminal.	29	4	3
442	 Your father lacks an appreciation	29	4	3
443	 of the finer points of bad behavior.	29	4	3
444	 So do the Braavosi.	29	4	3
445	 - You've sailed to Braavos? - Of course.	29	4	3
446	 Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos.	29	4	3
447	 I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers,	29	4	3
448	 but he didn't seem any more interested in the distinction than your father.	30	4	3
449	 I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos	30	4	3
450	 and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom,	30	4	3
451	 you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction--	30	4	3
452	 - What was that for? - I need you to write a message.	30	4	3
453	 You should write it yourself. It's good practice.	30	4	3
454	 It's too important for me.	30	4	3
455	 I need a smart person to do it. Go on.	30	4	3
456	 To the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos	30	4	3
457	 from Stannis Baratheon the one true king of Westeros.	30	4	3
458	 But that's not you.	30	4	3

468	 No.	31	4	3
469	 Where's the daddy?	31	4	3
470	 He's dead.	31	4	3
471	 Oh. Where you from?	31	4	3
472	 North of here.	31	4	3
473	 North of here?	31	4	3
474	 You a fucking wildling?	31	4	3
475	 - Only room and board? - That's right.	32	4	3
476	 She'll clean and cook	32	4	3
477	 and look after the other girls' babies.	32	4	3
478	 Could find other work for her, too.	32	4	3
479	 - No other work. - There'd be money.	32	4	3
480	 Give you a piece of it.	32	4	3
481	 No other work.	32	4	3
482	 I promise to come back and visit whenever I can.	32	4	3
483	 You'll be safer here.	32	4	3
484	 Who's gonna protect you at Castle Black? Me?	32	4	3
485	 You protected me north of the Wall.	32	4	3
486	 This is different.	32	4	3
487	 They're brothers of the Night's Watch	32	4	3

499	 No?	34	4	3
500	 I'm sorry. You're lovely,	34	4	3
501	 I just never acquired the taste.	34	4	3
502	 You're calling my beauty an acquired taste?	34	4	3
503	 That's quite all right, lover. It's more for you.	34	4	3
504	 Your loss.	34	4	3
505	 You like them both the same?	34	4	3
506	 - Boys and girls? - Does that surprise you?	34	4	3
507	 Everyone has a preference.	34	4	3
508	 Then everyone is missing half the world's pleasure.	34	4	3

528	 They will all have to line up behind you.	35	4	3
529	 ( door opens )	35	4	3
530	 -  Prince Oberyn. - Lord Tywin.	35	4	3
531	 May we have the room?	35	4	3
532	 Call my name if you need me, lover.	36	4	3
533	 Would you like to sit?	36	4	3
534	 No, thank you.	36	4	3
535	 Some wine?	36	4	3
536	 No, thank you.	36	4	3
537	 ( door closes )	36	4	3
538	 - I'm sorry about your grandson. - Are you?	36	4	3
539	 I don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father.	36	4	3
540	 Or his grandfather.	36	4	3
541	 An awful way to die.	36	4	3
542	 Which way is that?	36	4	3
543	 Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?	36	4	3
544	 Some believe the king choked.	36	4	3
545	 Some believe the sky is blue because we live	36	4	3
546	 inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant.	36	4	3
547	 The king was poisoned.	36	4	3
548	 I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.	36	4	3
549	 I did. This is why I know.	36	4	3
550	 Your hatred for my family is rather well known.	37	4	3
551	 You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning,	37	4	3
552	 some days later my grandson dies of poisoning.	37	4	3
553	 Rather suspicious.	37	4	3
554	 Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?	37	4	3
555	 You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel	37	4	3
556	 on the day that you arrived.	37	4	3
557	 What did you discuss?	37	4	3
558	 You think we conspired together?	37	4	3
559	 What did you discuss?	37	4	3
560	 The death of my sister.	37	4	3
561	 For which you blame me.	37	4	3
562	 She was raped and murdered by the Mountain.	37	4	3
563	 The Mountain follows your orders.	37	4	3
564	 Of course I blame you.	37	4	3
565	 Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.	37	4	3
566	 Should I be concerned?	37	4	3
567	 You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that.	37	4	3
568	 I am a man of reason.	37	4	3
569	 If I cut your throat today,	37	4	3
570	 I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow.	37	4	3
571	 Men at war commit all kinds of crimes	37	4	3
572	 without their superiors' knowledge.	37	4	3
573	 So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?	37	4	3
574	 Categorically.	37	4	3
575	 I would like to speak with the Mountain.	38	4	3
576	 I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.	38	4	3
577	 He might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would.	38	4	3
578	 I could arrange for this meeting.	38	4	3
579	 But you want something in return.	38	4	3
580	 There will be a trial for my son.	38	4	3
581	 And as custom dictates,	38	4	3
582	 three judges will render a verdict.	38	4	3
583	 I will preside.	38	4	3
584	 Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge.	38	4	3
585	 I would like you to be the third.	38	4	3
586	 Why?	38	4	3
587	 Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon.	38	4	3
588	 Declared themselves enemies of the throne.	38	4	3
589	 Now they are our strongest allies.	38	4	3
590	 Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen.	38	4	3
591	 Asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting.	38	4	3
592	 I will also invite you to sit on the small council	39	4	3
593	 to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors.	39	4	3
594	 I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.	39	4	3
595	 We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold.	39	4	3
596	 The king is dead. The Greyjoys are in open rebellion.	39	4	3
597	 A wildling army marches on the Wall.	39	4	3
598	 And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons.	39	4	3
599	 Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros.	39	4	3
600	 Only the Dornish managed to resist	39	4	3
601	 Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.	39	4	3
602	 You're saying you need us?	39	4	3
603	 That must be hard for you to admit.	39	4	3
604	 We need each other.	39	4	3
605	 You help me serve justice to the king's assassins	39	4	3
606	 and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.	40	4	3
607	 ( door unlocks )	40	4	3
608	 Podrick.	40	4	3
609	 Apologies for the stench.	40	4	3
610	 I brought you some wine, my lord, but they took it from me.	40	4	3
611	 A noble effort.	40	4	3
612	 They didn't find the candles, though.	40	4	3
613	 A quill, some parchment,	40	4	3
614	 duck sausage, almonds,	40	4	3
615	 and some hard cheese.	40	4	3
616	 You're a good lad.	40	4	3
617	 Any word of Shae?	40	4	3
618	 I've heard nothing, my lord.	40	4	3
619	 I suppose that's a good thing.	40	4	3
620	 What are they saying about me out there?	40	4	3
621	 You're to stand trial in a fortnight	40	4	3
622	 for murdering the king.	41	4	3
623	 Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?	41	4	3
624	 No, my lord.	41	4	3
625	 You didn't?	41	4	3
626	 No. Gods, no.	41	4	3
627	 The world is a better place without him,	41	4	3
628	 but I had nothing to do with it.	41	4	3
629	 I would like to think	41	4	3
630	 if I were arranging a royal assassination,	41	4	3
631	 I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there	41	4	3
632	 gawking like a fool when the king died.	41	4	3
633	 Trial in a fortnight.	41	4	3
634	 Have they announced the judges yet?	41	4	3
635	 - Your father. - Of course.	41	4	3
636	 Mace Tyrell.	41	4	3
637	 Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.	41	4	3
638	 And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.	41	4	3
639	 Oberyn?	41	4	3
640	 Give it to my father.	41	4	3
641	 He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.	41	4	3
642	 I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord.	41	4	3
643	 Anyone who might testify on your behalf.	42	4	3
644	 Oh, I can call my own witnesses?	42	4	3
645	 How generous of them.	42	4	3
646	 Very well, my wife. Sansa.	42	4	3
647	 My lord, she's gone.	42	4	3
648	 - Gone? - No one's seen her since the wedding.	42	4	3
649	 You don't think she...	42	4	3
650	 No one had more cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa,	42	4	3
651	 but the girl is no assassin.	42	4	3
652	 Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it.	42	4	3
653	 And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty.	42	4	3
654	 - Podrick. - Yes, my lord?	42	4	3
655	 - They'll be following you now. - Who will?	42	4	3
656	 I don't know. They. They. The ominous they.	42	4	3
657	 The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father.	42	4	3
658	 Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him.	42	4	3
659	 Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle.	42	4	3
660	 Whenever something bad happens to me,	42	4	3
661	 I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it.	42	4	3
662	 But say what you will of Cersei,	43	4	3
663	 she loves her children.	43	4	3
664	 She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder.	43	4	3
665	 Which makes it unique	43	4	3
666	 as King's Landing murders go.	43	4	3
667	 Any other witnesses, my lord?	43	4	3
668	 Varys could vouch for me if he dared.	43	4	3
669	 He's already been called as a witness for the queen.	43	4	3
670	 Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.	43	4	3
671	 I've already asked, my lord.	43	4	3
672	 - They won't let him see you. - Why not?	43	4	3
673	 They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate.	43	4	3
674	 He's under investigation himself.	43	4	3
675	 And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?	43	4	3
676	 I'll ask, my lord.	43	4	3
677	 There's something else, my lord.	43	4	3
678	 A man, I didn't know his face,	43	4	3
679	 he came to ask if I'd testify against you.	43	4	3
680	 Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne	44	4	3
681	 if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the Strangler.	44	4	3
682	 Ser Podrick Payne?	44	4	3
683	 Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?	44	4	3
684	 I didn't tell them anything, my lord.	44	4	3
685	 Are you going to accept their offer?	44	4	3
686	 My lord.	44	4	3
687	 Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion.	44	4	3
688	 If they can't tempt you with honey,	44	4	3
689	 they'll choose something less sweet.	44	4	3
690	 You've been good to me, my lord.	44	4	3
691	 Pod, the trial's in a fortnight.	44	4	3
692	 They'll want an answer before that.	44	4	3
693	 I already gave them an answer, my lord.	44	4	3
694	 I will not have you dying on my behalf.	44	4	3
695	 Do you hear me? If I have to take	44	4	3
696	 that long walk to the executioner's block,	44	4	3
697	 I don't want to see your head already mounted.	44	4	3
698	 - My lord. - Pod, I am giving you an order.	44	4	3
699	 Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him.	44	4	3
700	 And get yourself out of King's Landing	44	4	3
701	 before it's too late.	44	4	3
702	 Pod!	44	4	3
703	 This is farewell.	45	4	3
704	 Farewell, my lord.	45	4	3
705	 ( door opens )	45	4	3
706	 Pod.	45	4	3
707	 There has never lived a more loyal squire.	45	4	3
708	 ( door closes )	45	4	3
709	  Mother says it's time to eat.	45	4	3
710	 What's she got boiling? Wait. Wait. Let me guess.	45	4	3
711	 - Potatoes. - Potatoes.	45	4	3
712	 Well, no one boils a potato better than your mom.	45	4	3
713	 Has she got--	45	4	3
714	  The wildlings!	45	4	3
715	 Guymon!	46	4	3
716	 Hide.	46	4	3
717	 Hide!	46	4	3
718	 ( screams )	46	4	3
719	 ( shouting, screaming )	46	4	3
720	 ( grunting )	46	4	3
721	 You know how to get to Castle Black?	47	4	3
722	 Yes. Yes.	47	4	3
723	 Those your parents?	47	4	3
724	 Open your eyes.	47	4	3
725	 I'm going to eat them.	47	4	3
726	 Do you hear me?	47	4	3
727	 I'm going to eat your dead mama	47	4	3
728	 and I'm going to eat your dead papa.	47	4	3
729	 Go tell the crows at Castle Black.	47	4	3
730	  We need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind.	47	4	3
731	  Aye! Aye!	47	4	3
732	   Three dozen bodies with slit throats	47	4	3
733	 tossed off the top of the Wall.	47	4	3
734	 - Seems like that would be a good lesson. - Aye!	47	4	3
735	 If we go after them, we'll be giving them what they want.	47	4	3
736	 They want to draw us out,	47	4	3
737	 pick us off a few at a time.	48	4	3
738	 We have just over 100 men.	48	4	3
739	 And that's including stewards and builders.	48	4	3
740	 And me. We can't afford to lose a single man.	48	4	3
741	 We must remember our first responsibility.	48	4	3
742	 We are the watchers on the Wall.	48	4	3
743	 There's got to be a way to protect them.	48	4	3
744	 You're a champion of the common people, Lord Snow.	48	4	3
745	 What do you say to Brother Pyp's proposition?	48	4	3
746	 Mance Rayder is coming.	48	4	3
747	 If the wildlings breach the Wall,	48	4	3
748	 they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 miles	48	4	3
749	 before they reach an army that can stop them.	48	4	3
750	 We need to shore up Castle Black	48	4	3
751	 and we need to defend the Wall.	48	4	3
752	 That is our job.	48	4	3
753	 ( horn blows )	49	4	3
754	 Rangers returning.	49	4	3
755	 Help him.	49	4	3
756	 Thought you'd have blue eyes by now.	49	4	3
757	 What took you so long?	49	4	3
758	 - We were held up. - By what?	49	4	3
759	 Chains.	49	4	3
760	 We were guests of the mutineers at Craster's Keep.	49	4	3
761	 - And the mutineers stayed? - They're not going anywhere.	49	4	3
762	 They've got Craster's food and his wives.	49	4	3
763	 Dolorous  Poor girls.	49	4	3
764	 Never thought they'd miss their daddy.	49	4	3
765	 Karl's running things now.	49	4	3
766	 He's the one who put a knife through Craster's mouth.	49	4	3
767	 We need to ride north and kill them all.	49	4	3
768	 We just went over this, boy.	49	4	3
769	 - Justice can wait. - It's not about justice.	49	4	3
770	 I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone.	49	4	3
771	 Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do.	50	4	3
772	 How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves	50	4	3
773	 when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off?	50	4	3
774	 Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet.	50	4	3
775	 As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will.	50	4	3
776	 Then he'll throw his full strength at us.	50	4	3
777	 And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings,	50	4	3
778	 there's still not a thing we can do to stop them.	50	4	3
779	 I don't think I can kill 100 wildlings.	50	4	3
780	 ( people murmuring )	51	4	3
781	  Are they attacking?	51	4	3
782	  A single rider.	51	4	3
783	 A champion of Meereen.	51	4	3
784	 They want you to send your own champion against him.	51	4	3
785	 ( cheering )	51	4	3
786	 ( horse whinnies )	52	4	3
787	 ( speaking Valyrian )	52	4	3
788	 What is he doing?	52	4	3

790	 ( city crowd laughing, cheering )	52	4	3
791	 ( sighs )	52	4	3
792	 ( laughing )	52	4	3
793	 He says that we're an army of men without man parts.	52	4	3
794	 He claims you are no woman at all, but a man who...	52	4	3
795	 hides his cock in his own asshole.	52	4	3
796	 Ignore him, Your Grace. These are meaningless words.	52	4	3
797	 They're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them.	52	4	3
798	 I have something to say to the people of Meereen.	52	4	3
799	 First, I will need this one to be quiet.	53	4	3
800	 Do I have a champion?	53	4	3

805	 Your Grace, I've won more single combats than any man alive.	53	4	3
806	 Which is why you must remain by my side.	53	4	3
807	 I've been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi.	53	4	3
808	 Let me stand for you today as well.	53	4	3
809	 You are my most trusted advisor,	53	4	3
810	 my most valued general, and my dearest friend.	53	4	3
811	 I will not gamble with your life.	53	4	3
812	  I was the last to join your army.	53	4	3
813	 I'm not your general or a member of your Queensguard	53	4	3
814	 or the commander of your Unsullied.	53	4	3
815	 My mother was a whore. I come from nothing.	53	4	3
816	 And before long, I will return to nothing.	53	4	3
817	 Let me kill this man for you.	53	4	3
818	 Very well.	53	4	3
819	 You have quite an audience.	53	4	3
820	 Make it worth their while.	53	4	3
821	 He is very brave, Your Grace.	54	4	3
822	 Yes, win or lose,	54	4	3
823	 as long as the whole city is watching.	54	4	3
824	 You sure you don't want a horse?	54	4	3
825	   Why would I want a horse?	54	4	3
826	 Horses are faster than men.	54	4	3
827	 Horses are dumber than men.	54	4	3

48	 Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.	5	3	10
49	 What are you doing?	5	3	10
50	 I have a list.	5	3	10
51	 A list of people you mean to kill?	5	3	10
52	 For laughing at me?	5	3	10
53	 Do I look like Joffrey to you?	5	3	10
54	 No, death seems a bit extreme.	5	3	10
55	 Fear of death, on the other hand...	5	3	10
56	 You should learn to ignore them.	5	3	10
57	 My lady, people have been laughing at me	5	3	10
58	 far longer than they've been laughing at you.	5	3	10
59	 I'm the Halfman,	5	3	10
60	 the Demon Monkey, the Imp.	5	3	10
61	 You're a Lannister.	5	3	10
62	 I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark.	5	3	10
63	 The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey.	5	3	10
64	 We're perfect for each other.	5	3	10
65	 So how should we punish them?	5	3	10
66	 Who? Whom?	5	3	10
67	 Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.	5	3	10
68	 Ah.	5	3	10
69	 I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions.	5	3	10
70	 Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.	5	3	10
71	 I hear that you're a pervert.	5	3	10
72	 I am the Imp.	5	3	10
73	 I have certain standards to maintain.	5	3	10
74	 We could sheep shift Lord Desmond's bed.	6	3	10
75	 You cut a little hole in his mattress	6	3	10
76	 and you stuff sheep dung inside.	6	3	10
77	 Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again.	6	3	10
78	 His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from.	6	3	10
79	 Lady Sansa!	6	3	10
80	 My sister used to do that when she was angry with me.	6	3	10
81	 And she was always angry with me.	6	3	10
82	 Why sheep shift?	6	3	10
83	 That's the vulgar word for dung.	6	3	10
84	 My lady...	6	3	10
85	 Well, you asked me.	6	3	10
86	 Oh!	6	3	10
87	 That's him!	6	3	10
88	 My lord, my lady.	6	3	10
89	 Your father has called a meeting of the small council.	6	3	10
90	 Killed a few puppies today?	6	3	10
91	 Show him.	6	3	10
92	 Come on, show him.	6	3	10
93	 Oh, apologies, my lord.	6	3	10

106	 Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage.	7	3	10
107	 A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.	7	3	10
108	 Yes, I did.	7	3	10
109	 I'm going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast.	7	3	10
110	 No.	7	3	10
111	 She is no longer yours to torment.	7	3	10
112	 Everyone is mine to torment.	7	3	10
113	 You'd do well to remember that, you little monster.	7	3	10
114	 Oh, I'm a monster.	8	3	10
115	 Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then.	8	3	10
116	 Monsters are dangerous	8	3	10
117	 and just now kings are dying like flies.	8	3	10
118	 I could have your tongue out	8	3	10
119	 for saying that.	8	3	10

121	 Hmm? He's a bitter little man.	8	3	10
122	 Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately.	8	3	10

143	 Not you.	9	3	10
144	 You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros	10	3	10
145	 to bed without his supper.	10	3	10
146	 You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.	10	3	10
147	 A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.	10	3	10
148	 You really think a crown gives you power?	10	3	10
149	 No.	10	3	10
150	 I think armies give you power.	10	3	10
151	 - Mm-hmm. - Robb Stark had one,	10	3	10
152	 never lost a battle,	10	3	10
153	 and you defeated him all the same.	10	3	10
154	 - Mm-hmm. - Oh, I know.	10	3	10
155	 Walder Frey gets all the credit.	10	3	10
156	 Or the blame, I suppose,	10	3	10
157	 depending on your allegiance.	10	3	10
158	 Walder Frey is many things,	10	3	10
159	 but a brave man?	10	3	10
160	 No.	10	3	10
161	 He never would have risked such an action	10	3	10
162	 if he didn't have certain assurances.	10	3	10
163	 Which he got from me.	10	3	10
164	 Do you disapprove?	10	3	10
165	 I'm all for cheating. This is war.	10	3	10
166	 But to slaughter them at a wedding...	10	3	10
167	 Explain to me why it is more noble	10	3	10
168	 to kill 10,000 men in battle	11	3	10
169	 than a dozen at dinner.	11	3	10
170	 So that's why you did it?	11	3	10
171	 To save lives?	11	3	10
172	 To end the war. To protect the family.	11	3	10
173	 Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks?	11	3	10
174	 Go ahead, write one.	11	3	10
175	 I'm in this world a little while longer	11	3	10
176	 to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood.	11	3	10
177	 The northerners will never forget.	11	3	10
178	 Good.	11	3	10

183	 Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North	11	3	10
184	 until your son by Sansa comes of age.	11	3	10
185	 I believe you still have some work to do on that score.	11	3	10
186	 Do you think she'll open her legs for me	11	3	10
187	 after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?	11	3	10
188	 One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant.	12	3	10
189	 I will not rape her.	12	3	10
190	 Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?	12	3	10
191	 Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.	12	3	10
192	 The house that puts family first will always defeat	12	3	10
193	 the house that puts the whims and wishes	12	3	10
194	 of its sons and daughters first.	12	3	10
195	 A good man does everything in his power	12	3	10
196	 to better his family's position	12	3	10
197	 regardless of his own selfish desires.	12	3	10
198	 Does that amuse you?	12	3	10
199	 No, it's a very good lesson.	12	3	10
200	 Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family	12	3	10
201	 when you're making all the decisions.	12	3	10
202	 Easy for me, is it?	12	3	10
203	 When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest	12	3	10
204	 but solely for the benefit of the family?	12	3	10
205	 The day that you were born.	12	3	10
206	 I wanted to carry you into the sea	12	3	10
207	 and let the waves wash you away.	13	3	10
208	 Instead, I let you live.	13	3	10
209	 And I brought you up as my son.	13	3	10
210	 Because you're a Lannister.	13	3	10
211	 Sansa.	13	3	10
212	 It's empty.	14	3	10
213	 Let's find a place to sleep.	14	3	10
214	 Hodor.	14	3	10
215	 Hodor.	14	3	10
216	 Don't, Hodor.	14	3	10
217	 Maybe we shouldn't stay here.	14	3	10
218	 You'd rather be out there?	14	3	10
219	 There are a lot of stories about this place.	14	3	10
220	 Horrible stories.	14	3	10
221	 I always quite liked the horrible stories.	14	3	10
222	 So did I.	14	3	10
223	 Once.	14	3	10
224	 You ever heard about the Rat Cook?	14	3	10
225	 No. Who's he?	14	3	10
226	 Just a cook in the Night's Watch.	14	3	10
227	 He was angry at the king for something,	14	3	10
228	 I don't remember.	14	3	10
229	 When the king was visiting the Nightfort,	14	3	10
230	 the cook killed the king's son,	14	3	10
231	 cooked him into a big pie	14	3	10
232	 with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon.	14	3	10
233	 That night he served the pie to the king.	15	3	10
234	 He liked the taste of his son so much,	15	3	10
235	 he asked for a second slice.	15	3	10
236	 The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat	15	3	10
237	 who could only eat his own young.	15	3	10
238	 He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since,	15	3	10
239	 devouring his own babies.	15	3	10
240	 But no matter what he does,	15	3	10
241	 he's always hungry.	15	3	10
242	 If the gods turned every killer	15	3	10
243	 into a giant white rat--	15	3	10
244	 It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook	15	3	10
245	 or for serving the king's son in a pie.	15	3	10
246	 He killed a guest beneath his roof.	15	3	10
247	 That's something the gods can't forgive.	15	3	10
248	" ""The late Walder Frey,"" old Tully called me"	15	3	10
249	 because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle.	15	3	10
250	 He thought he was witty.	15	3	10
251	 Look at us now, Tully.	16	3	10
252	 You're dead, your daughter's dead,	16	3	10
253	 your grandson's dead,	16	3	10

260	 - Who does he have? - As you say.	16	3	10
261	 They all laughed at me,	16	3	10
262	 all those high lords.	16	3	10
263	 They all thought they were better than me.	16	3	10
264	 Ned Stark, Hoster Tully.	16	3	10
265	 People snigger when I marry a young girl,	16	3	10
266	 but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?	16	3	10
267	 You'll be needing a new young girl.	16	3	10
268	 Yeah.	16	3	10
269	 Got that to look forward to.	16	3	10
270	 And you,	16	3	10
271	 the Warden of the North.	16	3	10
272	 No more Starks to bow and scrape to.	16	3	10
273	 Must have been torture	16	3	10
274	 following that stupid boy all over the country.	17	3	10
275	 He ignored my advice at every turn.	17	3	10
276	 If he'd been a trifle less arrogant...	17	3	10
277	 Calling himself the Young Wolf.	17	3	10
278	 How's that for pomposity?	17	3	10
279	 Well, here's to the Young Wolf!	17	3	10
280	 Forever young.	17	3	10
281	 Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over?	17	3	10
282	 At some point perhaps.	17	3	10
283	 But Winterfell's in ruins.	17	3	10
284	 Yeah.	17	3	10
285	 What happened up there?	17	3	10
286	 I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place.	17	3	10
287	 I heard he killed all the ravens.	17	3	10
288	 And after that, nothing.	17	3	10
289	 I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.	17	3	10
290	 Robb Stark offered amnesty for the ironborn	17	3	10
291	 if they gave us Theon.	17	3	10
292	 Oh. And?	17	3	10
293	 Ramsay delivered the terms.	17	3	10
294	 The ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would.	17	3	10
295	 They handed him over trussed and hooded.	17	3	10
296	 But Ramsay-- well...	18	3	10
297	 Ramsay has his own way of doing things.	18	3	10
298	 Well, the girls weren't lying.	18	3	10
299	 You had a good-sized cock.	18	3	10
300	 What?	18	3	10
301	 No.	18	3	10
302	 Pork sausage.	18	3	10
303	 You think I'm some sort of savage?	18	3	10
304	 People talk about phantom limbs.	18	3	10
305	 An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be.	18	3	10
306	 So I've always wondered...	18	3	10
307	 do eunuchs have a phantom cock?	18	3	10
308	 Next time you think about naked girls,	18	3	10
309	 would you feel an itch?	19	3	10
310	 Sorry.	19	3	10
311	 I shouldn't make jokes.	19	3	10
312	 My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.	19	3	10
313	 But my father taught me to aim for their head.	19	3	10
314	 Kill me.	19	3	10
315	 Sorry, what?	19	3	10
316	 Kill me.	19	3	10
317	 A little louder.	19	3	10
318	 Kill me!	19	3	10
319	 You're no good to me dead.	19	3	10
320	 We need you.	19	3	10
321	 You don't look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore.	20	3	10
322	 That's a name for a lord.	20	3	10
323	 But you're not a lord,	20	3	10
324	 are you?	20	3	10
325	 You're just meat.	20	3	10
326	 Stinking meat.	20	3	10

348	 You're Jon's brother.	22	3	10
349	 The one who fell from the window.	22	3	10
350	 No, I'm not.	22	3	10
351	 I've been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one.	22	3	10
352	 And I've heard all about Hodor.	22	3	10
353	 Hodor.	22	3	10
354	 I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon.	22	3	10

358	 What?	23	3	10
359	 Why in the world would you want to go--	23	3	10
360	 I don't want to. I have to.	23	3	10
361	 How did you get through the Wall?	23	3	10
362	 Does the well lead to an underground river? Is that how you came here?	23	3	10
363	 Come with us.	23	3	10
364	 There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall.	23	3	10
365	 Hodor can carry you to the top.	23	3	10
366	 We'll walk straight to Castle Black.	23	3	10
367	 Come with us. There's nothing north but death.	23	3	10
368	 If Jon is alive,	23	3	10
369	 then Castle Black's where he'll be.	23	3	10
370	 It's the safest place for you.	23	3	10
371	 There's nowhere safe any longer. You know that.	23	3	10
372	 What I know is what I saw.	23	3	10
373	 And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way.	23	3	10
374	 You saw the white walkers and the army of the dead.	23	3	10
375	 How do you know all that?	23	3	10
376	 The Night's Watch can't stop them.	23	3	10
377	 The kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them.	23	3	10

401	 Get that out of my sight.	25	3	10
402	 Theon disobeyed my orders.	26	3	10
403	 The boy is a fool.	26	3	10
404	 He cannot further the Greyjoy line.	26	3	10
405	 I will not give up the lands I have seized,	26	3	10
406	 the strongholds I have taken.	26	3	10
407	 Get this away from me.	26	3	10
408	 He's your son.	26	3	10
409	 Son?	26	3	10
410	 He's not a man anymore.	26	3	10
411	 He's your son.	26	3	10
412	 He's my brother.	26	3	10
413	 He's a Greyjoy.	26	3	10
414	 Watch yourself.	26	3	10
415	 I've made my decision.	26	3	10
416	 And I've made mine.	26	3	10
417	 I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.	26	3	10
418	 I'm going to choose the 50 best killers on the Iron Islands.	26	3	10
419	 Get those ropes!	27	3	10
420	 I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea	27	3	10
421	 all the way to the Weeping Water.	27	3	10
422	 I'm going to march on the Dreadfort.	27	3	10
423	 I'm going to find my little brother	27	3	10
424	 and I'm going to bring him home.	27	3	10
425	 What is it?	27	3	10
426	 Dragonglass.	27	3	10
427	 We found them at the Fist.	27	3	10
428	 Someone buried them a long time ago.	27	3	10
429	 Someone wanted us to find them.	27	3	10
430	 Why? What are they for?	27	3	10
431	 Killing white walkers.	27	3	10
432	 How do you know that?	27	3	10
433	 The walker came for my baby.	27	3	10
434	 And Sam...	27	3	10
435	 But no one's killed a white walker in thousands of years.	27	3	10
436	 Well, I suppose someone had to be the first.	27	3	10
437	 Take it, Hodor.	27	3	10
438	 And the archer.	28	3	10
439	 I got lucky	28	3	10
440	 with one of them.	28	3	10
441	 There are more.	28	3	10
442	 Many more.	28	3	10
443	 And for every one of them,	28	3	10
444	 the dead men,	28	3	10
445	 more than you could count.	28	3	10
446	 I wish you'd come with us.	28	3	10
447	 I wish I could.	28	3	10
448	 I really do.	28	3	10
449	 How are you keeping?	29	3	10
450	 Great.	29	3	10
451	 Never better.	29	3	10
452	 It was just a bit of blood.	29	3	10
453	 I should have known.	29	3	10
454	 Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble.	29	3	10
455	 We're not really people to you, are we?	29	3	10
456	 Just a million different ways to get what you want.	29	3	10
457	 - I'm not a highborn. - She called you Ser.	29	3	10
458	 I heard it.	29	3	10
459	 A recent state of affairs.	29	3	10
460	 I was born in Flea Bottom just like you.	29	3	10
461	 Sure, you were.	29	3	10
462	 You're my friend. You're here to help.	30	3	10
463	 I lived below the Street of Flour.	30	3	10
464	 How far below?	30	3	10
465	 How close to the Red Keep were you?	30	3	10
466	 The shit that poured from their privy pipes	30	3	10
467	 flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill	30	3	10
468	 along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door	30	3	10
469	 - on Gin Alley. - Gin Alley.	30	3	10
470	 The Street of Steel,	30	3	10
471	 with your armor and your knights? Pfft.	30	3	10
472	 You lived in the fancy part of town.	30	3	10
473	 And here we are now.	30	3	10
474	 Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king.	30	3	10
475	 Yeah, we've come a long way.	30	3	10
476	 We're all the same, really.	30	3	10
477	 She went to great pains to point that out to me.	30	3	10
478	 If you mistrust fancy people so much,	30	3	10
479	 why were you in such a hurry to trust her?	30	3	10
480	 You're me.	30	3	10
481	 Never been with a woman.	30	3	10
482	 Never talked to a woman, really.	30	3	10
483	 And then she comes at you--	31	3	10
484	 big words, no clothes.	31	3	10
485	 What would you have done?	31	3	10
486	 She does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that.	31	3	10
487	 So how'd you become a lord?	31	3	10
488	 Oh, that's a long story.	31	3	10
489	 Better not, then. I'm a bit busy.	31	3	10
490	 Many years ago I helped King Stannis	31	3	10
491	 out of a difficult situation.	31	3	10
492	 He rewarded me with a lordship.	31	3	10
493	 And this.	31	3	10
494	 You see?	31	3	10
495	 Highborns.	31	3	10
496	 I didn't want to be a lord.	31	3	10
497	 I nearly didn't accept.	31	3	10
498	 Why did you?	31	3	10
499	 I did it for my son.	31	3	10
500	 I didn't want him to step over a river of shit	31	3	10
501	 every time he stepped through his front door.	31	3	10
502	 I wanted him to have a better life.	32	3	10
503	 Does he?	32	3	10
504	 He's dead.	32	3	10
505	 How'd he die?	32	3	10
506	 Following me.	32	3	10
507	 When did you come to this strange country?	32	3	10
508	 When I was 13.	32	3	10
509	 You were only a child.	32	3	10
510	 I stopped being a child when I was nine.	32	3	10
511	 My mother made sure of that.	32	3	10
512	 You've been a good influence	32	3	10
513	 on our mutual friend, you know.	32	3	10
514	 He used to drink from sundown to sunup,	32	3	10
515	 visit three brothels a night,	32	3	10
516	 gamble away his father's money.	32	3	10
517	 Now it's just the drinking.	32	3	10
518	 And now I'm his wife's servant.	32	3	10
519	 I brush her hair and clip her nails	33	3	10
520	 and empty her chamber pot.	33	3	10
521	 She is a sweet young thing.	33	3	10
522	 None of this is her fault.	33	3	10
523	 I love that girl. I would kill for her.	33	3	10
524	 Do you think that makes it easier for me?	33	3	10
525	 No, I expect not.	33	3	10
526	 She's young and she's beautiful and highborn.	33	3	10
527	 We break bread with them,	33	3	10
528	 but that doesn't make us family.	33	3	10
529	 We've learned their language,	33	3	10
530	 but we'll never be their countrymen.	33	3	10
531	 If you let yourself believe	33	3	10
532	 that a foreign girl with no name	33	3	10
533	 could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister--	33	3	10
534	 - I have a name. - You have one name.	33	3	10
535	 As do I.	33	3	10
536	 Here only the family name matters.	33	3	10
537	 What do you want from me, Lord Varys?	33	3	10
538	 Diamonds.	33	3	10
539	 I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth,	33	3	10
540	 but you know how to protect yourself.	33	3	10
541	 Get on one of those ships.	33	3	10
542	 Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr.	34	3	10
543	 You can buy a house with these diamonds,	34	3	10
544	 a very large house.	34	3	10
545	 Hire servants.	34	3	10
546	 Start a new life,	34	3	10
547	 a good life, far from here.	34	3	10
548	 The mysterious foreign beauty.	34	3	10
549	 You'll have suitors lining up.	34	3	10
550	 Why do you want me to leave?	34	3	10
551	 Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive	34	3	10
552	 who could make this country a better place.	34	3	10
553	 He has the mind for it, he has the will,	34	3	10
554	 he has the right last name.	34	3	10
555	 And you--	34	3	10
556	 you are a complication.	34	3	10
557	 I know you love him.	34	3	10
558	 And I know it's true love not bought by gold and silver.	34	3	10
559	 I'm not asking you to leave him for money.	34	3	10
560	 I'm asking you to leave	34	3	10
561	 because your presence in the capital	34	3	10
562	 endangers him.	34	3	10
563	 This will never be your home, my lady.	34	3	10
564	 Find a true home somewhere far from here...	34	3	10
565	 while there's still time.	34	3	10
566	 Lord Varys.	35	3	10
567	 If he wants me to leave, he can tell me himself.	35	3	10
568	 Keep up.	35	3	10
569	 I don't think I can, my lord.	35	3	10
570	 It's not easy being drunk all the time.	35	3	10
571	 Everyone would do it if it were easy.	35	3	10
572	 Leave.	35	3	10
573	 So, enjoying married life?	35	3	10
574	 An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend.	35	3	10
575	 She doesn't deserve this.	35	3	10
576	 Deserve?	35	3	10
577	 Be careful with that.	35	3	10
578	 Start trying to work out who deserves what	36	3	10
579	 and before long you'll spend the rest of your days	36	3	10
580	 weeping for each and every person in the world.	36	3	10
581	 There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.	36	3	10
582	 Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras	36	3	10
583	 with the same philosophical spirit?	36	3	10
584	 I won't be marrying Ser Loras.	36	3	10
585	 I seem to remember saying something similar	36	3	10
586	 about my own marriage.	36	3	10
587	 You're not me.	36	3	10
588	 You want to make things better for Sansa?	36	3	10
589	 Give her a child.	36	3	10
590	 So you can tell Father it was you	36	3	10
591	 who finally talked me into it?	36	3	10
592	 So she can have some happiness in her life.	36	3	10
593	 You have children.	36	3	10
594	 How happy would you say you are?	36	3	10
595	 Not very.	36	3	10
596	 But if it weren't for my children,	36	3	10
597	 I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep.	36	3	10
598	 They're the reason I'm alive.	36	3	10
599	 Even Joffrey?	36	3	10
600	 Even Joffrey.	37	3	10
601	 He was all I had once.	37	3	10
602	 Before Myrcella was born.	37	3	10
603	 I used to spend hours	37	3	10
604	 looking at him.	37	3	10
605	 His wisps of hair.	37	3	10
606	 His tiny little hands and feet.	37	3	10
607	 He was such a jolly little fellow.	37	3	10
608	 You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies.	37	3	10
609	" ""We should have known. Even then we should have known."""	37	3	10
610	 It's nonsense.	37	3	10
611	 Whenever he was with me, he was happy.	37	3	10
612	 And no one can take that away from me,	37	3	10
613	 not even Joffrey--	37	3	10
614	 how it feels to have someone.	37	3	10
615	 Someone of your own.	37	3	10
616	 How long does it go on?	38	3	10
617	 Until we've dealt with all our enemies.	38	3	10
618	 Every time we deal with an enemy,	38	3	10
619	 we create two more.	38	3	10
620	 Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time.	38	3	10
621	 I'm telling you, that's what she did.	38	3	10
622	 Sounded like a cow in heat.	38	3	10
623	 - Aye, not for long. - That's right.	38	3	10
624	 Black Walder shut her up right quick.	38	3	10
625	 None of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal.	38	3	10
626	 I'll tell you what, though.	38	3	10
627	 The hardest thing was getting that wolf's head to stay on the body.	38	3	10
628	 - You sewed it on? - I did.	38	3	10
629	 I bet there were 1,000 men claiming they were the one.	38	3	10
630	 It was me.	38	3	10
631	 And Malcolm and Talbott.	38	3	10
632	 Well, the thing was so heavy, it fell off the first time.	38	3	10
633	 Took the skin right with it.	39	3	10
634	 What we ended up having to do was hook the needle	39	3	10
635	 right under the collarbone.	39	3	10
636	 Give it a nice firm mooring and--	39	3	10
637	 What do you want?	39	3	10
638	 - Mind if I keep warm? - Fuck off.	39	3	10
639	 But I'm hungry.	39	3	10
640	 Does fuck off mean something different where you're from?	39	3	10
641	 I've got money.	39	3	10
642	 What kind of coin is that?	39	3	10
643	 It's worth a lot.	39	3	10
644	 Sorry.	39	3	10
645	 Little shit.	39	3	10
646	 Fool!	39	3	10
647	 Where did you get the knife?	39	3	10
648	 From you.	40	3	10
649	 Is that the first man you've killed?	40	3	10
650	 The first man.	40	3	10
651	 Next time you're going to do something like that,	40	3	10
652	 tell me first.	40	3	10
653	 Valar morghulis.	40	3	10
654	 Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice.	40	3	10
655	 You always knew who I was,	41	3	10
656	 what I am.	41	3	10
657	 I have to go home now.	41	3	10
658	 I know you won't hurt me.	41	3	10
659	 You know nothing, Jon Snow.	41	3	10
660	 I do know some things.	41	3	10
661	 I know I love you.	41	3	10
662	 I know you love me.	41	3	10
663	 But I have to go home now.	41	3	10
664	 I know how this must look.	42	3	10
665	 - What I meant was-- - I swear to you, my lord--	42	3	10
666	 I'm not a lord, my dear.	42	3	10
667	 Not for many, many years.	42	3	10

684	 when you joined this order?	43	3	10
685	 He's not my child, Maester Aemon.	43	3	10
686	 She's one of Craster's wives.	43	3	10
687	 I remember every word of the oath.	43	3	10
688	 Night gathers and my watch begins.	43	3	10
689	 I am the shield that guards the realms of men.	43	3	10
690	 The realms of men.	43	3	10
691	 That means her as well as us.	43	3	10
692	 We didn't build 500 miles of ice walls	43	3	10
693	 700 feet high to keep out men.	43	3	10
694	 The night is gathering, Maester Aemon.	43	3	10
695	 I've seen it.	44	3	10
696	 It's coming for all of us.	44	3	10
697	 Gilly, you and your son	44	3	10
698	 will be our guests for the time being.	44	3	10
699	 We certainly cannot send you back	44	3	10
700	 beyond the Wall.	44	3	10
701	 Thank you...	44	3	10
702	 Maester.	44	3	10
703	 I can cook and clean and I can--	44	3	10
704	 Good.	44	3	10
705	 Samwell, fetch a quill and inkwell.	44	3	10
706	 I hope your penmanship is better than your swordplay.	44	3	10
707	 Miles better.	44	3	10

758	 And do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?	47	3	10
759	 On the back of his dragon Balerion the Dread.	47	3	10
760	 He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced	47	3	10
761	 and a smaller army, but he had three dragons.	47	3	10
762	 Dragons are magic, Ser Davos.	47	3	10
763	 My enemies have made my kingdom bleed.	47	3	10
764	 I will not forget that.	47	3	10
765	 I will not forgive that.	47	3	10
766	 I will punish them with any arms	47	3	10
767	 at my disposal.	48	3	10
768	 You do not need to burn the boy.	48	3	10
769	 If what you say is true,	48	3	10
770	 a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark--	48	3	10
771	 And our king is still no closer to the Iron Throne.	48	3	10
772	 A great gift requires a great sacrifice.	48	3	10
773	 His name is Gendry.	48	3	10
774	 He's a good lad.	48	3	10
775	 A poor lad from Flea Bottom	48	3	10
776	 who happens to be your nephew.	48	3	10
777	 What is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?	48	3	10
778	 Everything.	48	3	10
779	 The boy must die.	48	3	10
780	 - What are you doing? - You're leaving.	49	3	10
781	 Is this some kind of trick?	49	3	10
782	 Yes, but not on you.	49	3	10
783	 Aim for that star. Don't stop.	49	3	10
784	 There's bread and water. Go slow with it.	49	3	10
785	 If you finish it off,	49	3	10
786	 no matter how thirsty you get,	49	3	10
787	 don't drink seawater.	49	3	10
788	 I know not to drink seawater.	49	3	10
789	 Row for a full day and night and you'll reach Rook's Rest.	49	3	10
790	 You'll want to stop there. Don't. She'll find you.	49	3	10
791	 Where should I go?	49	3	10
792	 You must keep the coast on your left side	49	3	10
793	 until you reach King's Landing.	49	3	10
794	 The gold cloaks are looking for me.	49	3	10
795	 They were looking for me for 20 years.	49	3	10
796	 - Do they know your face? - No.	49	3	10
797	 I'd worry more about the Red Woman.	49	3	10
798	 The other way.	49	3	10
799	 You ever been in a boat before?	50	3	10
800	 No.	50	3	10
801	 You know how to swim?	50	3	10
802	 No.	50	3	10
803	 Don't fall out.	50	3	10
804	 Go on.	50	3	10
805	 Why are you doing this?	50	3	10
806	 Because it's right.	50	3	10
807	 And because I'm a slow learner.	50	3	10
808	 When you get to Flea Bottom, have a bowl of brown for me.	50	3	10
809	 Horse approaching!	50	3	10
810	 Halt! Halt!	50	3	10
811	 Jon! Jon!	50	3	10
812	 Jon, it's us.	50	3	10
813	 I don't think he can see us.	50	3	10
814	 Pyp?	51	3	10
815	 Sam?	51	3	10
816	 Hush, now. You're home.	51	3	10
817	 Carry him inside. Gently.	51	3	10
818	 Out of the way.	51	3	10
819	 Step aside, country boy.	51	3	10
820	 People working here.	51	3	10
821	 Cersei.	52	3	10
822	 You don't deny it?	52	3	10
823	 No.	52	3	10
824	 I let him go.	52	3	10
825	 Your mercy saved the boy's life.	52	3	10
826	 You feel good about that?	52	3	10
827	 Aye, I do.	52	3	10
828	 You saved one innocent.	52	3	10
829	 How many tens of thousands have you doomed?	53	3	10
830	 There has got to be another way.	53	3	10
831	 What other way?!	53	3	10
832	 Tell us about this other way.	53	3	10
833	 I don't know, Your Grace.	53	3	10
834	 I can't see the future in the fire.	53	3	10
835	 Very well, Ser Davos Seaworth.	53	3	10
836	 I, Stannis of the House Baratheon,	53	3	10
837	 First of My Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men,	53	3	10
838	 - sentence you to die. - I understand.	53	3	10
839	 But since you haven't yet unnamed me Hand of the King,	53	3	10
840	 it is my duty to advise you against it.	53	3	10
841	 - You're gonna need me. - Take him away.	53	3	10
842	 Why am I gonna need you?	53	3	10
843	 My king.	53	3	10
844	 It's from Maester Aemon of the Night's Watch.	53	3	10
845	 Their Lord Commander is dead.	53	3	10
846	 Took a ranging party north and never made it back.	53	3	10
847	 One lad did, though.	53	3	10
848	 What he saw beyond the Wall--	53	3	10
849	 it's coming for all of us.	54	3	10
850	 When did you learn to read?	54	3	10
851	 Matthos taught me before he died	54	3	10
852	 so I could be of better service to you.	54	3	10
853	 This War of Five Kings means nothing.	54	3	10
854	 The true war lies to the north, my king.	54	3	10
855	 Death marches on the Wall.	54	3	10
856	 Only you can stop him.	54	3	10
857	 You can't stop him alone.	54	3	10
858	 You need someone to rebuild your army for you,	54	3	10
859	 someone to convince this lord and that lord to fight for you,	54	3	10
860	 to bring sellswords and pirates to your side.	54	3	10
861	 I've made my decision.	54	3	10
862	 He's right. You need him.	54	3	10
863	 He has a part to play in the war to come.	54	3	10
864	 You see, Ser Davos?	55	3	10
865	 You've been saved by that fire god you like to mock.	55	3	10
866	 You're in his army now.	55	3	10
867	 They will come, Your Grace.	55	3	10
868	 When they're ready.	55	3	10
869	 Perhaps they didn't want to be conquered.	55	3	10
870	 You didn't conquer them.	55	3	10
871	 You liberated them.	55	3	10
872	 People learn to love their chains.	55	3	10
873	 No.	56	3	10
874	 - Mhysa! - Mhysa!	57	3	10
875	 Mhysa! Mhysa!	57	3	10
876	 Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!	57	3	10
877	 What does it mean?	57	3	10
878	 It is old Ghiscari, khaleesi.	57	3	10
879	" It means ""mother."""	57	3	10
880	 It's all right.	57	3	10
881	 These people won't hurt me.	57	3	10
882	 Mhysa! Mhysa!	57	3	10
883	 Mhysa.	58	3	10
884	 Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!	59	3	10
885		59	3	10
886		0	3	10
0	 1 Still not far from Pentos, Your Grace.	0	1	3
1	 You'd be more comfortable there.	0	1	3
2	 I have no interest in hospitality or comfort.	0	1	3
3	 I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfills	0	1	3
4	 his end of the bargain and I have my crown.	0	1	3
5	 I have something for you.	0	1	3
6	 First lesson: Stick them with the pointy end.	0	1	3
7	 17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon.	0	1	3
8	 - And now you're leaving again. - I have no choice.	0	1	3
9	 There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch.	0	1	3
10	 The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years.	0	1	3
11	 And you are a Stark.	0	1	3
12	 Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord.	0	1	3
13	 What of it? Tell me we're not speaking of this.	0	1	3
14	 I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.	0	1	3
15	 Rapers. Not impressed by your new brothers?	0	1	3
16	 Lovely thing about the watch--	0	1	3
17	 You discard your old family and get a whole new one.	0	1	3
18	 Welcome.	0	1	3
19	 I don't think Bran fell from that tower.	0	1	3
20	 I think he was thrown. No!	0	1	3
21	 Someone tried to kill him twice.	0	1	3
22	 I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved.	1	1	3
23	 - Lord Stark must be told of this. - I will go myself.	1	1	3
24	 What is the meaning of this?	1	1	3
25	 Joff told us what happened.	1	1	3
26	 You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.	1	1	3
27	 That's not what happened!	1	1	3
28	 Ahh!	1	1	3
29	 We found no trace of the direwolf, Your Grace.	1	1	3
30	 - We have another wolf. - As you will.	1	1	3
31	 He doesn't mean Lady, does he?	1	1	3
32	 Lady didn't bite anyone! She's good!	1	1	3
33		1	1	3
34	 Welcome, Lord Stark.	3	1	3
35	 Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the small council.	3	1	3
36	 The honor of your presence is requested.	3	1	3
37	 Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper.	4	1	3
38	 - And, Jory, you go with them. - Yes, My Lord.	4	1	3
39	 If you'd like to change into something more appropriate...	4	1	3
40	 Thank the gods you're here, Stark.	4	1	3
41	 About time we had some stern northern leadership.	4	1	3
42	 About glad to see you're protecting the throne.	4	1	3
43	 Sturdy old thing.	4	1	3
44	 How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder?	4	1	3
45	 Um, what's the line?	5	1	3
46	 The King shits and the Hand wipes.	5	1	3
47	 Very handsome armor.	5	1	3
48	 - Not a scratch on it. - I know.	5	1	3
49	 People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss.	5	1	3
50	 You've chosen your opponents wisely then.	5	1	3
51	 I have a knack for it.	5	1	3
52	 It must be strange for you coming into this room.	5	1	3
53	 I was standing right here when it happened.	5	1	3
54	 He was very brave, your brother.	5	1	3
55	 Your father too.	5	1	3
56	 They didn't deserve to die like that.	5	1	3
57	 Nobody deserves to die like that.	5	1	3
58	 But you just stood there and watched.	5	1	3
59	 500 men just stood there and watched.	5	1	3
60	 All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms--	5	1	3
61	 You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger?	5	1	3
62	 No, Lord Stark.	5	1	3
63	 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt.	5	1	3
64	 Except for the screams, of course,	6	1	3
65	 and the Mad King laughing.	6	1	3
66	 And later...	6	1	3
67	 When I watched the Mad King die,	6	1	3
68	 I remembered him laughing as your father burned...	6	1	3
69	 It felt like justice.	6	1	3
70	 Is that what you tell yourself at night?	6	1	3
71	 You're a servant of justice?	6	1	3
72	 That you were avenging my father when you	6	1	3
73	 shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?	6	1	3
74	 Tell me--	6	1	3
75	 If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back,	6	1	3
76	 would you admire me more?	6	1	3
77	 You served him well	6	1	3
78	 when serving was safe.	6	1	3
79	 Lord Stark.	7	1	3
80	 Lord Varys.	7	1	3
81	 I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad.	7	1	3
82	 We are all praying for prince Joffrey's full recovery.	7	1	3
83	 A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son.	7	1	3
84	 Renly! You're looking well.	7	1	3
85	 And you look tired from the road.	7	1	3
86	 I told them this meeting could wait another day, but--	7	1	3
87	 But we have a kingdom to look after.	7	1	3
88	 I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark.	7	1	3
89	 - No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me. - She has, Lord Baelish.	7	1	3
90	 I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.	7	1	3
91	 All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem	7	1	3
92	 from navel to collarbone.	7	1	3
93	 Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.	7	1	3
94	 It wasn't the man that I chose, My Lord.	7	1	3
95	 It was Catelyn Tully.	7	1	3
96	 A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree.	7	1	3
97	 I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.	8	1	3
98	 Grand Maester.	8	1	3
99	 How many years has it been?	8	1	3
100	 - You were a young man. - And you served another King.	8	1	3
101	 Oh, how forgetful of me.	8	1	3
102	 This belongs to you, now.	8	1	3
103	 Should we begin?	8	1	3
104	 - Without the King? - Winter may be coming,	8	1	3
105	 but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother.	8	1	3
106	 His Grace has many cares.	8	1	3
107	 He entrusts some small matters to us	8	1	3
108	 that we might lighten the load.	8	1	3
109	 We are the lords of small matters here.	8	1	3
110	 My brother instructs us to stage a tournament	8	1	3
111	 in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.	8	1	3
112	 - Mmm, how much? - 40,000 gold dragons to the champion,	8	1	3
113	 20,000 to the runner-up,	8	1	3
114	 20,000 to the winning archer.	8	1	3
115	 Can the treasury bear such expense?	9	1	3
116	 I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect.	9	1	3
117	 We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?	9	1	3
118	 Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?	9	1	3
119	 I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.	9	1	3
120	 How could you let this happen?	9	1	3
121	 The Master of Coin finds the money.	9	1	3
122	 The King and the Hand spend it.	9	1	3
123	 I will not believe Jon Arryn	9	1	3
124	 allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.	9	1	3
125	 Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice,	9	1	3
126	 but I fear His Grace	9	1	3
127	" - doesn't always listen. - ""Counting coppers,"" he calls it."	9	1	3
128	 I'll speak to him tomorrow.	9	1	3
129	 This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.	9	1	3
130	 As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans.	9	1	3
131	 There will be no plans	9	1	3
132	 until I speak to Robert.	9	1	3
133	 Forgive me, my Lords. I'm--	9	1	3
134	 - I had a long ride. - You are the King's Hand,	9	1	3
135	 Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure.	9	1	3
136	 - Ow! - Please, it's nearly healed.	10	1	3
137	 - It's ugly. - A King should have scars	10	1	3
138	 you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father.	10	1	3
139	 I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything.	10	1	3
140	 It bit me and all I did was scream.	10	1	3
141	 And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.	10	1	3
142	 That's not true. You killed the beast.	10	1	3
143	 You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father.	10	1	3
144	 I didn't, I--	10	1	3
145	 When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne,	10	1	3
146	 your father was a rebel and a traitor.	10	1	3
147	 Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.	10	1	3
148	 Do I have to marry her?	10	1	3
149	 Yes.	10	1	3
150	 She's very beautiful and young.	10	1	3
151	 If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions	10	1	3
152	 and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses.	10	1	3
153	 And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores.	11	1	3
154	 And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it.	11	1	3
155	 You are my darling boy and the world will be	11	1	3
156	 exactly as you want it to be.	11	1	3
157	 Do something nice for the Stark girl.	11	1	3
158	 - I don't want to. - No, but you will.	11	1	3
159	 The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road.	11	1	3
160	 We allow the northerners too much power.	11	1	3
161	 They consider themselves our equals.	11	1	3
162	 How would you handle them?	11	1	3
163	 I'd double their taxes	11	1	3
164	 and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army.	11	1	3
165	 - A royal army? - Why should every lord command his own men?	11	1	3
166	 It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes.	11	1	3
167	 We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown,	11	1	3
168	 trained by experienced soldiers--	11	1	3
169	 Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives.	11	1	3
170	 And if the northerners rebel?	11	1	3
171	 I'd crush them.	11	1	3
172	 Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm	12	1	3
173	 as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe.	12	1	3
174	 And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?	12	1	3
175	 - For me. I'm their King. - Mm-hmm.	12	1	3
176	 But you've just invaded their homeland,	12	1	3
177	 - asked them to kill their brothers. - I'm not asking.	12	1	3
178	 The North cannot be held-- not by an outsider.	12	1	3
179	 It's too big and too wild. And when the winter comes,	12	1	3
180	 the seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army.	12	1	3
181	 A good King knows when to save his strength...	12	1	3
182	 And when to destroy his enemies.	12	1	3
183	 So you agree...	12	1	3
184	 The Starks are enemies?	12	1	3
185	 Everyone who isn't us	12	1	3
186	 is an enemy.	12	1	3
187	 Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food.	12	1	3
188	 - I'm practicing. - Practicing for what?	12	1	3
189	 - The prince. - Arya, stop!	12	1	3
190	 He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.	12	1	3
191	 The Hound killed your friend.	13	1	3
192	 The Hound does whatever the prince tells him to do.	13	1	3
193	 - You're an idiot. - You're a liar, and if you told the truth	13	1	3
194	 - Mycah would be alive. - Enough!	13	1	3
195	 What's happening here?	13	1	3
196	 Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.	13	1	3
197	 Go to your room. We'll speak later.	13	1	3
198	 That's for you, love.	13	1	3
199	 The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys.	13	1	3
200	 Don't you like it?	13	1	3
201	 I haven't played with dolls since I was eight.	13	1	3
202	 - May I be excused? - You've barely eaten a thing.	13	1	3
203	 It's all right. Go on.	13	1	3
204	 War was easier than daughters.	14	1	3
205	 Go away!	14	1	3
206	 Arya, open the door.	14	1	3
207	 May I come in?	14	1	3
208	 - Whose sword is that? - Mine.	14	1	3
209	 Give it to me.	14	1	3
210	 I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work.	14	1	3
211	 Where did you get this?	14	1	3
212	 This is no toy.	15	1	3
213	 - Little ladies shouldn't play with swords. - I wasn't playing.	15	1	3
214	 And I don't want to be a lady.	15	1	3
215	 Come here.	15	1	3
216	 Now what do you want with this?	15	1	3
217	 It's called Needle.	15	1	3
218	 Oh, a blade with a name.	15	1	3
219	 And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle?	15	1	3
220	 Your sister?	15	1	3
221	 Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?	15	1	3
222	 Stick 'em with the pointy end.	15	1	3
223	 That's the essence of it.	15	1	3
224	 I was trying to learn.	15	1	3
225	 I asked Mycah to practice with me.	15	1	3
226	 I asked him.	15	1	3
227	 - It was my fault. - No, sweet girl.	15	1	3
228	 No no, you didn't kill the butcher's boy.	16	1	3
229	 I hate them! I hate all of them.	16	1	3
230	 The Hound, the Queen and the King	16	1	3
231	 and Joffrey and Sansa.	16	1	3
232	 Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen...	16	1	3
233	 And asked to call the prince a liar.	16	1	3
234	 So was I! He is a liar.	16	1	3
235	 Shh, darling, listen to me.	16	1	3
236	 Sansa will be married to Joffrey's someday.	16	1	3
237	 She cannot betray him.	16	1	3
238	 She must take his side even when he's wrong.	16	1	3
239	 But how you can let her marry someone like that?	16	1	3
240	 Well.	16	1	3
241	 Look at me.	16	1	3
242	 You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.	16	1	3
243	 Winter is coming.	16	1	3
244	 You were born in the long summer.	16	1	3
245	 You've never known anything else.	16	1	3
246	 But now winter is truly coming.	16	1	3
247	 And in the winter, we must protect ourselves,	17	1	3
248	 look after one another. Sansa is your sister.	17	1	3
249	 I don't hate her.	17	1	3
250	 Not really.	17	1	3
251	 I don't want to frighten you,	17	1	3
252	 but I won't lie to you either.	17	1	3
253	 We've come to a dangerous place.	17	1	3
254	 We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves.	17	1	3
255	 All right?	17	1	3
256	 Go on. It's yours.	17	1	3
257	 I can keep it?	17	1	3
258	 Try not to stab your sister with it.	17	1	3
259	 If you're going to own a sword,	17	1	3
260	 you'd better know how to use it.	17	1	3
261	 Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars.	18	1	3
262	 - I know a story about a crow. - I hate your stories.	18	1	3
263	 I know a story about a boy who hated stories.	18	1	3
264	 I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall.	18	1	3
265	 Those were always your favorites.	18	1	3
266	 Those weren't my favorites.	18	1	3
267	 My favorites were the scary ones.	18	1	3
268	 Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear?	18	1	3
269	 Fear is for the winter,	18	1	3
270	 when the snows fall a hundred feet deep.	18	1	3
271	 Fear is for the long night,	18	1	3
272	 when the sun hides for years	18	1	3
273	 and children are born and live and die	18	1	3
274	 all in darkness.	18	1	3
275	 That is the time for fear, my little Lord,	18	1	3
276	 when the white walkers move through the woods.	18	1	3
277	 Thousands of years ago there came a night	19	1	3
278	 that lasted a generation.	19	1	3
279	 Kings froze to death in their castles,	19	1	3
280	 same as the shepherds in their huts.	19	1	3
281	 And women smothered their babies	19	1	3
282	 rather than see them starve,	19	1	3
283	 and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks.	19	1	3
284	 So is this the sort of story that you like?	19	1	3
285	 In that darkness,	19	1	3
286	 the White Walkers came for the first time.	19	1	3
287	 They swept through cities and kingdoms,	19	1	3
288	 riding their dead horses,	19	1	3
289	 hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds--	19	1	3
290	 What are you telling him now?	19	1	3
291	 Only what what are the little lord wants to hear.	19	1	3
292	 Get your supper. I want some time with him.	19	1	3
293	 One time she told me	20	1	3
294	 the sky is blue because we live inside the eye	20	1	3
295	 of a blue-eyed giant named Macomber.	20	1	3
296	 Maybe we do.	20	1	3
297	 How do you feel?	20	1	3
298	 You still don't remember anything?	20	1	3
299	 Bran,	20	1	3
300	 I've seen you climb a thousand times.	20	1	3
301	 In the wind, in the rain--	20	1	3
302	 A thousand times.	20	1	3
303	 - You never fall. - I did though.	20	1	3
304	 It's true, isn't it,	20	1	3
305	 what Maester Luwin says about my legs?	20	1	3
306	 I'd rather be dead.	20	1	3
307	 - Don't ever say that. - I'd rather be dead.	20	1	3
308	 Fewer eyes back here, My Lady.	21	1	3
309	 But still too many.	21	1	3
310	 It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital.	21	1	3
311	 And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.	21	1	3
312	 My Lady.	21	1	3
313	 Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?	21	1	3
314	 I would. We've done nothing wrong.	21	1	3
315	 We've been instructed to escort you into the city.	21	1	3
316	 Instructed?	21	1	3
317	 I don't know who's providing your instructions, but--	21	1	3
318	 Follow me, Lady Stark.	21	1	3
319	 Cat! Go on.	21	1	3
320	 Go upstairs.	22	1	3
321	 You little worm!	22	1	3
322	 You take me for some back-alley Sally	22	1	3
323	 you can drag into a--	22	1	3
324	 Pssst!	22	1	3
325	 I meant no disrespect	22	1	3
326	 to you of all people.	22	1	3
327	 How dare you bring me here!	22	1	3
328	 Have you lost your mind?	22	1	3
329	 No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what you wanted?	22	1	3
330	 I'm truly sorry about the locale.	22	1	3
331	 How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?	22	1	3
332	 A dear friend told me.	22	1	3
333	 - Lady Stark. - Lord Varys.	22	1	3
334	 To see you again after so many years is a blessing.	22	1	3
335	 Your poor hands.	22	1	3
336	 How did you know I was coming?	22	1	3
337	 Knowledge is my trade, My Lady.	22	1	3
338	 Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance?	22	1	3
339	 My little birds are everywhere...	23	1	3
340	 Even in the north.	23	1	3
341	 They whisper to me the strangest stories.	23	1	3
342	 Valyrian steel.	23	1	3
343	 Do you know whose dagger this is?	23	1	3
344	 I must admit I do not.	23	1	3
345	 Well well, this is an historic day.	23	1	3
346	 Something you don't know	23	1	3
347	 that I do.	23	1	3
348	 There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms.	23	1	3
349	 - It's mine. - Yours?	23	1	3
350	 At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday.	23	1	3
351	 I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting,	23	1	3
352	 as any sane man would.	23	1	3
353	 When the Knight of the Glowers unseated him,	23	1	3
354	 I lost this dagger.	23	1	3
355	 To whom?	23	1	3
356	 Tyrion Lannister.	24	1	3
357	 The Imp.	24	1	3
358	 Grenn, show him what you farm boys are made of.	24	1	3
359	 If that were a real sword, you'd be dead.	24	1	3
360	 Lord Snow here grew up in a castle	24	1	3
361	 spitting down on the likes of you.	24	1	3
362	 Pyp.	24	1	3
363	 Do you think Ned Stark's bastard	24	1	3
364	 bleeds like the rest of us?	24	1	3
365	 Next!	24	1	3
366	 Next!	24	1	3
367	 Well, Lord Snow,	25	1	3
368	 it appears you're the least useless person here.	25	1	3
369	 Go clean yourselves up.	25	1	3
370	 There's only so much I can stomach in a day.	25	1	3
371	 A charming man.	25	1	3
372	 I don't need him to be charming.	25	1	3
373	 I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways	25	1	3
374	 into men of the Night's Watch.	25	1	3
375	 And how's that going, Commander Mormont?	25	1	3
376	 Slowly.	25	1	3
377	 A raven came	25	1	3
378	 for Ned Stark's son.	25	1	3
379	 Good news or bad?	25	1	3
380	 Both.	25	1	3
381	 Lord Stark.	25	1	3
382	 I meant to give you this earlier.	25	1	3
383	 So forgetful these days.	25	1	3
384	 A raven from Winterfell this morning.	26	1	3
385	 Good news?	26	1	3
386	 Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?	26	1	3
387	 - My wife is in Winterfell. - Is she?	26	1	3
388	 Yes, I'm looking at you.	26	1	3
389	 I thought that she'd be safest in here.	26	1	3
390	 One of several such establishments I own.	26	1	3
391	 You're a funny man.	26	1	3
392	 Huh? A very funny man.	26	1	3
393	 Ned!	26	1	3
394	 Ah, the Starks--	27	1	3
395	 Quick tempers, slow minds.	27	1	3
396	 You broke my nose, bastard!	27	1	3
397	 It's an improvement.	27	1	3
398	 If we threw you over the Wall, I wonder how long it would take you to hit.	27	1	3
399	 I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.	27	1	3
400	 What're you looking at, Half Man?	27	1	3
401	 I'm looking at you.	27	1	3
402	 Yes.	27	1	3
403	 You've got an interesting face.	27	1	3
404	 Hmm, very distinctive faces.	27	1	3
405	 All of you.	27	1	3
406	 And what do you care about our faces?	27	1	3
407	 It's just I think they would look marvelous	27	1	3
408	 decorating spikes in King's Landing.	28	1	3
409	 Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it.	28	1	3
410	 We'll talk later, Lord Snow.	28	1	3
411	 Everybody knew what this place was	28	1	3
412	 and no one told me.	28	1	3
413	 No one but you.	28	1	3
414	 My father knew	28	1	3
415	 and he left me to rot at the Wall all the same.	28	1	3
416	 Grenn's father left him too...	28	1	3
417	 Outside a farmhouse when he was three.	28	1	3
418	 Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese.	28	1	3
419	 His little sister hadn't eaten in three days.	28	1	3
420	 He was given a choice: his right hand or the Wall.	28	1	3
421	 I've been asking the Lord commander about them.	28	1	3
422	 Fascinating stories.	28	1	3
423	 They hate me because I'm better than they are.	28	1	3
424	 It's a lucky thing none of them were trained	28	1	3
425	 by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik.	28	1	3
426	 I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword	28	1	3
427	 before they came here.	29	1	3
428	 Oh...	29	1	3
429	 Your brother Bran.	29	1	3
430	 He's woken up.	29	1	3
431	 The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother	29	1	3
432	 tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.	29	1	3
433	 We have proof. We have the blade.	29	1	3
434	 Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him.	29	1	3
435	 The only man who could say otherwise has no throat,	29	1	3
436	 thanks to your boy's wolf.	29	1	3
437	 Petyr has promised to help us find the truth.	29	1	3
438	 He's like a little brother to me, Ned.	29	1	3
439	 He would never betray my trust.	29	1	3
440	 I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake.	29	1	3
441	 A fool's task, admittedly,	29	1	3
442	 but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything.	29	1	3
443	 I won't forget this.	29	1	3
444	 You're a true friend.	29	1	3
445	 Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.	29	1	3
446	 - How could you be so stupid? - Calm down.	29	1	3
447	 He's a child-- 10 years old.	30	1	3
448	 - What were you thinking? - I was thinking of us.	30	1	3
449	 You're a bit late to start complaining about it now.	30	1	3
450	 - What has the boy told them? - Nothing.	30	1	3
451	 He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.	30	1	3
452	 Then what are you raving about?	30	1	3
453	 What if it comes back to him?	30	1	3
454	 If he tells his father what he saw--	30	1	3
455	 We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming.	30	1	3
456	 We'll say whatever we like.	30	1	3
457	 I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.	30	1	3
458	 - And my husband? - I'll go to war with him if I have to.	30	1	3
459	 They can write a ballad about us:	30	1	3
460	" ""The War for Cersei's Cunt."""	30	1	3
461	 - Let me go. - Never.	30	1	3
462	 - Let me go. - The boy	30	1	3
463	 won't talk.	30	1	3
464	 And if he does, I'll kill him.	30	1	3
465	 Him, Ned Stark, the King-- the whole bloody lot of them,	30	1	3
466	 until you and I are the only people	30	1	3
467	 left in this world.	30	1	3
468	 I wish I could see the girls.	31	1	3
469	 - It's too dangerous. - Just for a moment.	31	1	3
470	 Until we know who our enemies are--	31	1	3
471	 I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters.	31	1	3
472	 In my bones, I know it.	31	1	3
473	 Littlefinger's right.	31	1	3
474	 I can't do anything without proof.	31	1	3
475	 And if you find the proof?	31	1	3
476	 Then I bring it to Robert...	31	1	3
477	 And hope he's still the man I once knew.	31	1	3
478	 You watch yourself on the road, huh?	31	1	3
479	 That temper of yours is a dangerous thing.	31	1	3
480	 My temper? Gods be good,	31	1	3
481	 you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday.	31	1	3
482	 He still loves you.	31	1	3
483	 Does he?	31	1	3
484	 Off with you.	32	1	3
485	 Yes, it's been a long time.	32	1	3
486	 But I still remember every face.	32	1	3
487	 You remember your first?	33	1	3
488	 Of course, Your Grace.	33	1	3
489	 Who was it?	33	1	3
490	 A Tyroshi.	33	1	3
491	 - Never learned the name. - Hmm.	33	1	3
492	 How'd you do it?	33	1	3
493	 Lance through the heart.	33	1	3
494	 Quick one.	33	1	3
495	 Lucky for you.	33	1	3
496	 Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall.	33	1	3
497	 My horse took an arrow so I was on foot,	33	1	3
498	 slogging through the mud.	33	1	3
499	 He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad,	33	1	3
500	 thinking he could end the rebellion	33	1	3
501	 with single swing of his sword.	33	1	3
502	 I knocked him down with the hammer.	33	1	3
503	 Gods, I was strong then.	33	1	3
504	 Caved in his breastplate.	33	1	3
505	 Probably shattered every rib he had.	33	1	3
506	 Stood over him, hammer in the air.	33	1	3
507	" Right before I brought it down he shouted, ""Wait!"	34	1	3
508	" Wait."""	34	1	3
509	 They never tell you how they all shit themselves.	34	1	3
510	 They don't put that part in the songs.	34	1	3
511	 Stupid boy.	34	1	3
512	 Now the Tarlys bend the knee	34	1	3
513	 like everyone else.	34	1	3
514	 He could have lingered	34	1	3
515	 on the edge of the battle with the smart boys	34	1	3
516	 and today his wife would be making him miserable,	34	1	3
517	 his sons would be ingrates,	34	1	3
518	 and he'd be waking three times in the night	34	1	3
519	 to piss into a bowl. Wine!	34	1	3
520	 Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name.	34	1	3
521	 Lancel Lannister.	35	1	3
522	 Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter?	35	1	3
523	 What are you doing?	35	1	3
524	 - It's empty, Your Grace. - What do you mean it's empty?	35	1	3
525	 - There's no more wine. - Is that what empty means?	35	1	3
526	 So get more.	35	1	3
527	 Tell your cousin to get in here.	35	1	3
528	 Kingslayer!	35	1	3
529	 Get in here.	35	1	3
530	 Surrounded by Lannisters.	35	1	3
531	 Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair	35	1	3
532	 and their smug, satisfied faces.	35	1	3
533	 It must wound your pride, huh?	35	1	3
534	 Standing out there like a glorified sentry.	36	1	3
535	 Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin...	36	1	3
536	 Forced to mind the door while your King	36	1	3
537	 eats and drinks and shits and fucks.	36	1	3
538	 So come on.	36	1	3
539	 We're telling war stories.	36	1	3
540	 Who was your first kill, not counting old men?	36	1	3
541	 One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.	36	1	3
542	 I was there that day.	36	1	3
543	 You were only a squire, 16 years old.	36	1	3
544	 You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte.	36	1	3
545	 Best move I ever saw.	36	1	3
546	 A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina.	36	1	3
547	 Your outlaw...	36	1	3
548	 Any last words?	36	1	3
549	 - I cut his head off, so no. - Hmmm.	36	1	3
550	 What about Aerys Targaryen?	36	1	3
551	 What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back?	36	1	3
552	 I never asked.	37	1	3
553	 Did he call you a traitor?	37	1	3
554	 Did he plead for a reprieve?	37	1	3
555	 He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours...	37	1	3
556	" ""Burn them all."""	37	1	3
557	 If that's all, Your Grace...	37	1	3
558	 Do the Dothraki buy their slaves?	37	1	3
559	 The Dothraki don't believe in money.	38	1	3
560	 Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.	38	1	3
561	 - From whom? - If you rule a city	38	1	3
562	 and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices:	38	1	3
563	 Pay tribute or fight.	38	1	3
564	 An easy choice for most.	38	1	3
565	 Of course, sometimes it's not enough.	38	1	3
566	 Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he's given.	38	1	3
567	 He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly.	38	1	3
568	 Sometimes a Khal decides his riders haven't had a good fight in months	38	1	3
569	 - and need the practice. - Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.	38	1	3
570	 Tell them all to stop.	38	1	3
571	 You want the entire horde to stop?	38	1	3
572	 For how long?	38	1	3
573	 Until I command them otherwise.	38	1	3
574	 You're learning to talk like a Queen.	38	1	3
575	 Not a Queen.	38	1	3
576	 A Khaleesi.	38	1	3
577	 Annakhas dozgosores.	39	1	3
578	 You dare!	39	1	3
579	 You give commands to me? To me?	39	1	3
580	 You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.	39	1	3
581	 I don't take orders from savages	39	1	3
582	 or their sluts. Do you hear me?	39	1	3
583	 Hash shafka zali nharees, zhey Khaleesi?	39	1	3
584	 Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.	39	1	3
585	 No.	39	1	3
586	 Ishish chare acharoe hash me nem jervae	39	1	3
587	 - nharesoon. - Rakharo say you should take ear,	40	1	3
588	 - to teach respect. - Please please, don't hurt him.	40	1	3
589	 Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.	40	1	3
590	 Khaleesi vos zalo meme nem azisa.	40	1	3
591	 Huh?	40	1	3
592	 Shafki.	40	1	3
593	 Mormont! Kill these Dothraki dogs!	40	1	3
594	 I am your King!	40	1	3
595	 Shall we return to the Khalasar, khaleesi?	40	1	3
596	 Uh uh uh uh uh.	41	1	3
597	 You walk.	41	1	3
598	 I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time.	43	1	3
599	 - I'm leaving this morning. - You're leaving?	44	1	3
600	 I'm the First Ranger.	44	1	3
601	 My job is out there.	44	1	3
602	 - There have been disturbing reports. - What kind of reports?	44	1	3
603	 The kind I don't want to believe.	44	1	3
604	 I'm ready. I won't let you down.	44	1	3
605	 You're not going.	44	1	3
606	 You're no ranger, Jon.	44	1	3
607	 - But I'm better than every-- - Better than no one!	44	1	3
608	 Here...	44	1	3
609	 A man gets what he earns,	44	1	3
610	 when he earns it.	44	1	3
611	 We'll speak when I return.	44	1	3
612	 - A bear's balls. - Oh, you're joking?	45	1	3
613	 And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart	45	1	3
614	 all fried in his own fat.	45	1	3
615	 When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall	45	1	3
616	 and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves.	45	1	3
617	 And how do a bear's balls taste?	45	1	3
618	 A bit chewy.	45	1	3
619	 And what about you, My Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?	45	1	3
620	 Do Dornish girls count?	45	1	3
621	 So you roam the Seven Kingdoms,	45	1	3
622	 collaring pickpockets and horse thieves	45	1	3
623	 and bringing them here as eager recruits?	45	1	3
624	 Aye.	45	1	3
625	 But it's not all of 'em's done bad things.	45	1	3
626	 Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed.	45	1	3
627	 Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.	45	1	3
628	 They have a better chance finding feed than glory.	45	1	3
629	 The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it?	46	1	3
630	 Is that what we are, Lannister?	46	1	3
631	 An army of jesters in black?	46	1	3
632	 You don't have enough men to be an army	46	1	3
633	 and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny.	46	1	3
634	 I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell	46	1	3
635	 when you're back in King's Landing.	46	1	3
636	 But something to think about	46	1	3
637	 while you're drinking your wine down there,	46	1	3
638	 enjoying your brothels--	46	1	3
639	 Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall.	46	1	3
640	 Might be a wilding's axe that gets them,	46	1	3
641	 might be sickness,	46	1	3
642	 might just be the cold.	46	1	3
643	 They die in pain.	46	1	3
644	 And they do it so plump little lords like you	46	1	3
645	 can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort.	46	1	3
646	 Do you think I'm plump?	46	1	3
647	 Listen, Benjen-- May I call you Benjen?	46	1	3
648	 Call me what you like.	47	1	3
649	 I'm not sure what I've done to offend you.	47	1	3
650	 I have great admiration for the Night's Watch.	47	1	3
651	 I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.	47	1	3
652	 You know, my brother once told me	47	1	3
653	" that nothing someone says before the word ""but"""	47	1	3
654	 really counts.	47	1	3
655	 But...	47	1	3
656	 I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers	47	1	3
657	 are lurking beyond the Wall.	47	1	3
658	 I believe that the only difference	47	1	3
659	 between us and the wildlings is that	47	1	3
660	 when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened	47	1	3
661	 to live on the right side of it.	47	1	3
662	 You're right.	47	1	3
663	 The wildlings are no different from us.	47	1	3
664	 A little rougher maybe.	47	1	3
665	 But they're made of meat and bone.	47	1	3
666	 I know how to track them and I know how to kill them.	47	1	3
667	 It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights.	47	1	3
668	 You've never been north of the Wall,	47	1	3
669	 so don't tell me what's out there.	47	1	3
670	 Are you going below?	48	1	3
671	 - Keep well, keep warm. - Enjoy the capital, brother.	48	1	3
672	 Oh, I always do.	48	1	3
673	 I think he's starting to like me.	48	1	3
674	" - ""Going below""? - Aye."	48	1	3
675	 Into the tunnel	48	1	3
676	 and out the other side.	48	1	3
677	 He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.	48	1	3
678	 So you're heading down to King's Landing too.	48	1	3
679	 Aye, day after tomorrow.	48	1	3
680	 I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.	48	1	3
681	 Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.	48	1	3
682	 I... I travel a bit on the grubby side, My Lord.	48	1	3
683	 Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns.	48	1	3
684	 No one turns away a Lannister.	49	1	3
685	 At Jakar?	49	1	3
686	 Athjahakar.	49	1	3
687	 Ath ja haker.	49	1	3
688	 Athjahakar.	49	1	3
689	 Athjahakar.	49	1	3
690	 Yes, Khaleesi.	49	1	3
691	 Oh, what are you doing?	49	1	3
692	 When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi?	49	1	3
693	 You change, Khaleesi.	49	1	3
694	 For a man on horseback, the curved blade	49	1	3
695	 is a good thing, easier to handle.	49	1	3
696	 It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan.	49	1	3
697	 But a man in full plate--	49	1	3
698	 Shori tawakof	49	1	3
699	 the arakh won't get through the steel.	50	1	3
700	 That's where the broadsword has the advantage.	50	1	3
701	 Designed for piercing plate.	50	1	3
702	 - Armor. - Armor.	50	1	3
703	 Armor make a man...	50	1	3
704	 - Vroz? - Slow.	50	1	3
705	 - Slow. - It's true,	50	1	3
706	 but it also keeps a man alive.	50	1	3
707	 He still is.	50	1	3
708	 A man of great honor	50	1	3
709	 and I betrayed him.	50	1	3
710	 I don't think she wants to eat dog.	51	1	3
711	 The Khaleesi have baby inside her.	51	1	3
712	 It is true. She does not bleed for two moons.	51	1	3
713	 Her belly start to swell.	51	1	3
714	 She does not want to eat horse.	51	1	3
715	 I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper.	51	1	3
716	 I need to ride to Qohor.	51	1	3
717	 Uh, we ride for Vaes Dothrak.	51	1	3
718	 Don't worry. I'll catch you.	52	1	3
719	 The horde's easy to find.	52	1	3
720	 Don't stand so still.	52	1	3
721	 It's harder to hit a moving target.	52	1	3
722	 Except for you. You move too much.	52	1	3
723	 I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.	52	1	3
724	 How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?	52	1	3
725	 Eight-- no, nine.	52	1	3
726	 All of them brief?	52	1	3
727	 They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon.	52	1	3
728	 This summer has lasted nine.	52	1	3
729	 But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter.	52	1	3
730	 The Starks are always right eventually:	52	1	3
731	 Winter is coming.	53	1	3
732	 This one will be long	53	1	3
733	 and dark things will come with it.	53	1	3
734	 We've been capturing wildlings,	53	1	3
735	 more every month. They're fleeing south.	53	1	3
736	 The ones who flee say they've seen the White Walkers.	53	1	3
737	 Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids.	53	1	3
738	 One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions.	53	1	3
739	 He swore it right up to the moment	53	1	3
740	 Ned Stark chopped his head off.	53	1	3
741	 The Night's Watch is the only thing	53	1	3
742	 standing between the realm	53	1	3
743	 and what lies beyond.	53	1	3
744	 And it has has become an army	53	1	3
745	 of undisciplined boys and tired old men.	53	1	3
746	 There are less than a thousand of us now.	53	1	3
747	 We can't man the other castles on the Wall.	53	1	3
748	 We can't properly patrol the wilderness.	53	1	3
749	 We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed	53	1	3
750	 - and fed. - Your sister	53	1	3
751	 sits by the side the King.	54	1	3
752	 Tell her we need help.	54	1	3
753	 When winter does come,	54	1	3
754	 gods help us all if we're not ready.	54	1	3
755	 I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.	55	1	3
756	 It's either me or this cold.	55	1	3
757	 And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.	55	1	3
758	 Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?	55	1	3
759	 I expect I will.	55	1	3
760	 Gods know there aren't many feather beds	55	1	3
761	 between here and King's Landing.	55	1	3
762	 If you see my brother Bran,	55	1	3
763	 tell him I miss him.	55	1	3
764	 Tell him I'd visit if I could.	55	1	3
765	 Of course.	55	1	3
766	 He'll never walk again.	55	1	3
767	 If you're going to be a cripple,	55	1	3
768	 it's better to be a rich cripple.	55	1	3
769	 You take care, Snow.	55	1	3
770	 Farewell, My Lord.	55	1	3
771	 You are late, boy.	56	1	3
772	 Tomorrow you will be here at midday.	56	1	3
773	 Who are you?	56	1	3
774	 Your dancing master,	56	1	3
775	 Syrio Forel.	56	1	3
776	 Tomorrow you will catch it.	56	1	3
777	 Now pick it up.	56	1	3
778	 That is not the way, boy.	56	1	3
779	 This is not a greatsword that is needing two hands to swing it.	56	1	3
780	 - It's too heavy. - It is heavy as it needs to be	56	1	3
781	 to make you strong.	56	1	3
782	 Just so.	56	1	3
783	 One hand is all that is needed.	56	1	3
784	 Now you are standing all wrong.	56	1	3
785	 Turn your body sideface.	56	1	3
786	 Yes.	57	1	3
787	 So.	57	1	3
788	 You are skinny. That is good.	57	1	3
789	 The target is smaller.	57	1	3
790	 Now the grip-- Let me see.	57	1	3
791	 Yes.	57	1	3
792	 The grip must be delicate.	57	1	3
793	 What if I drop it?	57	1	3
794	 The steel must be part of your arm.	57	1	3
795	 Can you drop part of your arm? No.	57	1	3
796	 Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos.	57	1	3
797	 He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy.	57	1	3
798	 I'm a girl.	57	1	3
799	 Boy, girl-- you are a sword,	57	1	3
800	 that is all.	57	1	3
801	 That is the grip.	57	1	3
802	 You are not holding a battle-axe.	57	1	3
803	 - You are holding-- - A needle.	57	1	3
804	 Ahhh.	57	1	3
805	 Just so.	57	1	3
806	 Now we will begin the dance.	57	1	3
807	 Remember, child,	58	1	3
808	 this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning--	58	1	3
809	 The knight's dance,	58	1	3
810	 hacking and hammering.	58	1	3
811	 This is the Bravo's dance...	58	1	3
812	 The water dance.	58	1	3
813	 It is swift	58	1	3
814	 and sudden.	58	1	3
815	 All men are made of water,	58	1	3
816	 do you know this?	58	1	3
817	 If you pierce them,	58	1	3
818	 the water leaks out and they die.	58	1	3
819	 Now you will try to strike me.	58	1	3
820	 Ha!	58	1	3
821	 Up!	58	1	3
822	 Ha!	59	1	3
823	 Ah.	59	1	3
824	 Dead.	59	1	3
825	 Oh!	59	1	3
826	 Dead.	59	1	3
827	 Hup!	59	1	3
828	 Very dead.	59	1	3
829	 Come.	59	1	3
830	 Ah ah ah!	59	1	3
831	 Hup!	59	1	3
832	 Again, faster.	59	1	3
833	 Ah.	59	1	3

4	  Youre wearing a black cloak again.	3	4	10
5	  Ive been sent to negotiate with you.	3	4	10
6	  It appears my trusting nature got the better of me.	3	4	10
7	  Its happened before.	3	4	10
8	  I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow.	3	4	10
9	  Truly I was.	3	4	10
10	  The Halfhand ordered me to join your army	3	4	10
11	  and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black.	3	4	10
12	  He made me kill him so youd trust me.	3	4	10
13	  I was loyal	3	4	10
14	  to him and to my Nights Watch vows.	3	4	10
15	  All your vows?	3	4	10
16	  She wasnt enough to turn you, eh?	3	4	10
17	  Were you enough to turn her?	4	4	10
18	  She put three arrows in me	4	4	10
19	  when I escaped.	4	4	10
20	  Did you see her again at Castle Black?	4	4	10
21	  Yes.  And?	4	4	10
22	  Shes dead.	4	4	10
23	  Your doing?  No.	4	4	10
24	  Well drink to her.	4	4	10
25	  Of all the ways Id kill you,	4	4	10
26	  poison would be the last.	4	4	10
27	  Ygritte.  Ygritte.	4	4	10
28	  (coughs)	4	4	10
29	  Thats not wine.	5	4	10
30	  No, its a proper northern drink, Jon Snow.	5	4	10
31	  You did well. Fought hard.	5	4	10
32	  Killed some of our strongest men.	5	4	10
33	  One of our giants went into your tunnel	5	4	10
34	  and never came out again.	5	4	10
35	  Mag the Mighty.	5	4	10
36	  Hes dead.	5	4	10
37	  He killed my friend Grenn.	5	4	10
38	  He was their king.	5	4	10
39	  The last of a bloodline that stretches back	5	4	10
40	  before the First Men.	5	4	10
41	  Grenn came from a farm.	5	4	10
42	  Mag and Grenn.  Grenn and Mag.	5	4	10
43	  Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat?	5	4	10
44	  I dont imagine our guest has eaten anything	5	4	10
45	  for quite some time.	5	4	10
46	  So, youre here to strike a bargain?	5	4	10
47	  Turn your army around and go home.	5	4	10
48	  You know I know youre low on arrows,	5	4	10
49	  youre low on oil, youre low on men.	5	4	10
50	  How many are left, 50?	5	4	10
51	  I told Tormund and Orell.	6	4	10
52	  We have more than 1,000 men.	6	4	10
53	  I showed you everything I had.	6	4	10
54	  The whole army, 100,000 strong.	6	4	10
55	  And what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had.	6	4	10
56	  It wasnt much. As soon as I saw that,	6	4	10
57	  I sent 400 men to climb the Wall,	6	4	10
58	  an unmanned stretch five miles west of here.	6	4	10
59	  A lot of them will die climbing,	6	4	10
60	  but most of them will be over by the end of the day.	6	4	10
61	  Its me being honest with you, Jon Snow,	6	4	10
62	  which is more than youve ever done for me.	6	4	10
63	  My people have bled enough.	6	4	10
64	  Were not here to conquer.	6	4	10
65	  Were here to hide behind your Wall.	6	4	10
66	  Just like you. We need your tunnel.	6	4	10
67	  Now we both know that winter is coming.	6	4	10
68	  And if my people arent south of the Wall when it comes in earnest,	6	4	10
69	  well all end up worse than dead.	6	4	10
70	  You want to strike a bargain with me?	6	4	10
71	  Heres the bargain.	6	4	10
72	  You go back, you open the gates to us,	6	4	10
73	  and I swear to you that no one else will die.	6	4	10
74	  Refuse,	6	4	10
75	  and well kill every last man at Castle Black.	6	4	10
76	  Ah!	7	4	10
77	  Oh, thats why youre here.	7	4	10
78	  I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop you.	7	4	10
79	  Theyd kill you, of course.	7	4	10
80	  Theyd kill you slow.	7	4	10
81	  But you knew that when you came in here.	7	4	10
82	  Are you capable of that, Jon Snow?	7	4	10
83	  Killing a man in his own tent when hes just offered you peace?	7	4	10
84	  Is that what the Nights Watch is?	7	4	10
85	  Is that what you are?	7	4	10
86	   (horn blows)   Riders coming!	7	4	10
87	  Are you attacking us?  No.	7	4	10
88	  Its like you said, we dont have the men.	7	4	10
89	   (horn blowing)   (dogs barking)	7	4	10
90	 (men shouting)	7	4	10
91	 (horse whinnies)	7	4	10
92	  Hold! To me! To me!	8	4	10
93	 (men shouting)	8	4	10
94	  Stand down!	9	4	10
95	  I said my people have bled enough	9	4	10
96	  and I meant it.	9	4	10
97	 (shouting)	9	4	10
98	   Round them up.	9	4	10
99	  Stay with the horses.	9	4	10
100	  Youre the King-beyond-the-Wall?	10	4	10
101	  Do you know who I am?  Never had the pleasure.	10	4	10
102	  This is Stannis Baratheon,	10	4	10
103	  the one true king of the Seven Kingdoms.	10	4	10
104	  Were not in the Seven Kingdoms and youre not dressed for this weather.	10	4	10
105	  It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.	10	4	10
106	  We do not kneel.	10	4	10
107	  Ill have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall,	10	4	10
108	  have nowhere to put them, have nothing to feed them.	10	4	10
109	  Im not here to slaughter beat dogs.	10	4	10
110	  Their fate depends on their king.	10	4	10
111	  All the same, we do not kneel.	10	4	10
112	  Take these men away.	10	4	10
113	  Whats a man of the Nights Watch doing in a wildling camp?	10	4	10
114	  I was sent to discuss terms with the King-beyond-the-Wall.	10	4	10
115	  Youre speaking to the one true king, boy.	10	4	10
116	  You will address him as Your Grace.	10	4	10
117	  I know hes the king. My father died for him.	10	4	10
118	  My name is Jon Snow, Your Grace.	11	4	10
119	  Im Ned Starks son.	11	4	10
120	  Your father was an honorable man.	11	4	10
121	  He was, Your Grace.	11	4	10
122	  What do you think hed have done with him?	11	4	10
123	  I was this mans prisoner once.	11	4	10
124	  He could have tortured me. He could have killed me.	11	4	10
125	  But he spared my life.	11	4	10
126	  I think my father would have taken him prisoner,	11	4	10
127	  listened to what he had to say.	11	4	10
128	  Very well, then. Take him.	11	4	10
129	  Your Grace.	11	4	10
130	  If my father had seen the things that Ive seen,	11	4	10
131	  hed also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall.	11	4	10
132	  All of them.	11	4	10
133	 (flies buzzing)	12	4	10
134	  I would suggest milk of the poppy	12	4	10
135	  to ease his pain, but he is completely insensate.	12	4	10
136	  Bloody Martells.	12	4	10
137	  The cause appears to be manticore venom.	12	4	10
138	  It is. The Deaths Head manticore.	12	4	10
139	  Yes, Ive read a great deal about it.	12	4	10
140	  Its a horrible poison.	12	4	10
141	  Usually Mantari in origin.	12	4	10
142	  Oh! Yes, yes.	12	4	10
143	  Theres nothing to be done.	12	4	10
144	  Yes, there is.	12	4	10
145	  May I ask what you think youre doing?	12	4	10
146	  Saving him.	12	4	10
147	  Your Grace, I wish it were otherwise,	12	4	10
148	  but Ser Gregor is beyond saving.	12	4	10
149	  Well, well beyond.	12	4	10
150	  This man is not even a maester,	12	4	10
151	  let alone Grand Maester.	12	4	10
152	  Thats for the best.	12	4	10
153	  No maester knows how to save him.	12	4	10
154	  That is exactly the sort of arrogance	12	4	10
155	  that had him expelled from the Citadel, Your Grace.	12	4	10
156	  His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural.	12	4	10
157	  Rightly so, in my opinion.	12	4	10
158	  Youre dismissed, Grand Maester.	12	4	10
159	  But, Your Grace, this is my laboratory.	13	4	10
160	  Not anymore.   But I	13	4	10
161	 (scoffs)	13	4	10
162	 (door opens)	13	4	10
163	  You can save him?  Difficult to say, Your Grace.	13	4	10
164	  But if my past work is any guide	13	4	10
165	 (door slams)	13	4	10
166	  we stand a chance.	13	4	10
167	  Do everything you can.	13	4	10
168	  Come to me for anything you need.	13	4	10
169	  Thank you, Your Grace.	13	4	10
170	  You should know,	13	4	10
171	  the process may change him	13	4	10
172	  somewhat.	13	4	10
173	  Will it weaken him?	13	4	10
174	  Oh, no.	13	4	10
175	  Very well, then.	13	4	10
176	   Not another word.	13	4	10
177	  Weve been over this. The matters closed.	14	4	10
178	  Im opening it again.	14	4	10
179	  You were betrothed to Loras Tyrell.	14	4	10
180	  Youre still betrothed to Loras Tyrell.	14	4	10
181	  And you will marry Loras Tyrell	14	4	10
182	  as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.	14	4	10
183	  I will not.	14	4	10
184	  Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands.	14	4	10
185	  Tyrions sentence will be carried out tomorrow.	14	4	10
186	  You have on several occasions made great claims	14	4	10
187	  about your commitment to this familys future.	14	4	10
188	  Your role in that future	14	4	10
189	  is more vital now than it ever was.	14	4	10
190	  I dont care.	14	4	10
191	  I will stay in Kings Landing where I belong with my son the king.	14	4	10
192	  When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital.	14	4	10
193	  I decided to take your brother with me and not you.	14	4	10
194	  You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock	14	4	10
195	  under any circumstances. And if you recall	14	4	10
196	  Im not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories	14	4	10
197	  about the time you won.	14	4	10
198	  This isnt going to be one of those times.	14	4	10
199	  Do you think youll be the first person	14	4	10
200	  dragged into a sept to be married against her will?	14	4	10
201	  When you marched into the throne room to tell me	15	4	10
202	  wed won the Battle of Blackwater Do you remember?	15	4	10
203	  I was sitting on the Iron Throne with Tommen.	15	4	10
204	  I was about to give him essence of nightshade.	15	4	10
205	  Thats how far I was willing to go when I thought	15	4	10
206	  someone awful had come to take my son away.	15	4	10
207	  Someone awful is coming to take him away.	15	4	10
208	  No.  Joffrey is dead.	15	4	10
209	  Myrcellas been sold like livestock.	15	4	10
210	  And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy.	15	4	10
211	  My last boy.	15	4	10
212	  Margaery will dig her claws in,	15	4	10
213	  you will dig your claws in and youll fight over him	15	4	10
214	  like beasts until you rip him apart.	15	4	10
215	  I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen.	15	4	10
216	  And how will you do that?	15	4	10
217	  Ill tell everyone the truth.	15	4	10
218	  What truth would that be?	15	4	10
219	  You dont know, do you?	15	4	10
220	  You never believed it.	15	4	10
221	  How is that possible?	15	4	10
222	  What am I saying? Of course its possible.	16	4	10
223	  How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family	16	4	10
224	  have any conception what his actual family was doing?	16	4	10
225	  We were right there in front of you and you didnt see us.	16	4	10
226	  One look in the past 20 years,	16	4	10
227	  one real look at your own children and you would have known.	16	4	10
228	  Known what?	16	4	10
229	  Everything they say is true.	16	4	10
230	  About Jaime and me.  No.	16	4	10
231	  Your legacy is a lie.  No, no, no, no.	16	4	10
232	  I dont believe you.	16	4	10
233	  Yes, you do.	16	4	10
234	  Jaime.	16	4	10
235	  You won.	16	4	10
236	  One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself.	16	4	10
237	  Theres really nothing you wouldnt do, is there?	16	4	10
238	  For my family, no, nothing.	16	4	10
239	  I would do things for my family you couldnt imagine.	17	4	10
240	  Tyrion is your family.  Hes not.	17	4	10
241	  You dont get to choose.  I do. So do you.	17	4	10
242	  You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world	17	4	10
243	  Are you really mad enough to blame him for that?	17	4	10
244	  He didnt decide to kill her. He was an infant.	17	4	10
245	  A disease doesnt decide to kill you.	17	4	10
246	  All the same, you cut it out before it does.	17	4	10
247	  What do you decide? What do you choose?	17	4	10
248	  The things I did to get back to you,	17	4	10
249	  to endure all that, only to find you	17	4	10
250	  I choose you.	17	4	10
251	  Those are words.  Yes.	17	4	10
252	  Like the ones I just said to Father.	17	4	10
253	  I told him.	17	4	10
254	  Told him what?	17	4	10
255	  I told him about us.	17	4	10
256	  You told him?	17	4	10
257	  I told him I wont marry Loras Tyrell.	17	4	10
258	  I told him Im staying right here with Tommen, with you.	17	4	10
259	  You think hell just accept that?	17	4	10
260	  Go and ask him.	17	4	10
261	  What did you say?	17	4	10
262	  I dont want to talk about Tywin Lannister.	17	4	10
263	  I dont choose Tywin Lannister.	17	4	10
264	  I dont love Tywin Lannister.	18	4	10
265	  I love my brother.	18	4	10
266	  I love my lover.	18	4	10
267	  People will whisper, theyll make their jokes.	18	4	10
268	  Let them.	18	4	10
269	  Theyre all so small, I cant even see them.	18	4	10
270	  I only see what matters.	18	4	10
271	  Someone will walk in.	18	4	10
272	  I dont care.	18	4	10
273	 	18	4	10
274	 	18	4	10
275	 	18	4	10
276	 	18	4	10
277	 	18	4	10
278	 	18	4	10
279	 	18	4	10
280	  I can speak the common tongue if you wish.	19	4	10
281	  You speak it very well.	19	4	10
282	  Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal.	19	4	10
283	  I was tutor to his children.	19	4	10
284	  I taught them languages and history.	19	4	10
285	  They know a great deal about your family because of me.	19	4	10
286	  Little Calla is only seven,	19	4	10
287	  but she admires you very much.	19	4	10
288	  I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration.	19	4	10
289	  What can I do for you?	19	4	10
290	  When you took the city, the children begged me	19	4	10
291	  not to leave the house.	19	4	10
292	  But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must.	19	4	10
293	  So I lost my home.	19	4	10
294	  Now I live on the streets.	19	4	10
295	  I have outfitted mess halls	19	4	10
296	  to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.	19	4	10
297	  I do not mean to offend, Your Grace.	19	4	10
298	  I went to one of these places.	19	4	10
299	  The young prey on the old.	19	4	10
300	  Take what they want and beat us if we resist.	19	4	10
301	  My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order,	19	4	10
302	  my friend, this I promise you.	19	4	10
303	  Even if they are safe, who would I be there?	19	4	10
304	  What purpose would I serve?	20	4	10
305	  With my master, I was a teacher.	20	4	10
306	  I had the respect and love of his children.	20	4	10
307	  What is it that you want from me?	20	4	10
308	  Your Grace, I ask you	20	4	10
309	  to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal.	20	4	10
310	  You want to return to a man who owned you	20	4	10
311	  like a goat or a chair?	20	4	10
312	  Please, Your Grace.	20	4	10
313	  The young may rejoice in the new world you have built for them,	20	4	10
314	  but for those of us too old to change,	20	4	10
315	  there is only fear and squalor.	20	4	10
316	  I am not alone.	20	4	10
317	  There are many outside waiting to beg the same of you.	20	4	10
318	  I did not take this city to preside	20	4	10
319	  over the injustice I fought to destroy.	20	4	10
320	  I took it to bring people freedom.	20	4	10
321	  But freedom means making your own choices.	20	4	10
322	  I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master.	20	4	10
323	  It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.	20	4	10
324	  Thank you, Your Grace.	20	4	10
325	  Thank you.	21	4	10
326	  The masters will take advantage of this situation.	21	4	10
327	  The men serving them	21	4	10
328	  will be slaves in all but name.	21	4	10
329	  Approach, my friend.	21	4	10
330	 	21	4	10
331	 	21	4	10
332	 	21	4	10
333	 (sobbing)	21	4	10
334	 (speaking low Valyrian)	21	4	10
335	   I have brought you	21	4	10
336	  He came from the sky.	21	4	10
337	  The black one.	21	4	10
338	  The winged shadow.	22	4	10
339	  He came from the sky and	22	4	10
340	  My girl.	22	4	10
341	  My little girl.	22	4	10
342	 (sobbing)	22	4	10
343	   What was her name?	22	4	10
344	   Zala, Your Grace.	22	4	10
345	  How old was she?  Three.	22	4	10
346	  Three.	22	4	10
347	 	22	4	10
348	 	22	4	10
349	 	22	4	10
350	 	22	4	10
351	 (screeching)	22	4	10
352	 (roaring)	23	4	10
353	 (screeching)	24	4	10
354	 (screeching)	24	4	10
355	 (screeching)	24	4	10
356	    They came to us from White Harbor and Barrowton,	25	4	10
357	  from Fairmarket and Kings Landing,	25	4	10
358	  from north and south,	25	4	10
359	  from east and west.	25	4	10
360	  They died protecting men, women, and children	25	4	10
361	  who will never know their names.	25	4	10
362	  It is for us to remember them.	25	4	10
363	  Our brothers,	25	4	10
364	  we shall never see their like again.	25	4	10
365	   And now their watch is ended.	25	4	10
366	   And now their watch is ended.	25	4	10
367	  Your old blind man patched me up.	26	4	10
368	  Why?	26	4	10
369	  Hes sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe.	26	4	10
370	  You want me alive so you can torture me?	26	4	10
371	  No ones gonna torture you.	26	4	10
372	  So how do we die? Hanging? Beheading?	26	4	10
373	  Drop us from the top of the Wall?	26	4	10
374	  I dont know what happens to the prisoners.	26	4	10
375	  Who decides?	27	4	10
376	  I suppose Stannis does.	27	4	10
377	  He your king now?	27	4	10
378	  I dont have a king.	27	4	10
379	  You spent too much time with us, Jon Snow.	27	4	10
380	  You can never be a kneeler again.	27	4	10
381	  Were gonna burn the bodies of your dead.	27	4	10
382	  Do you want to say any words over them?	27	4	10
383	  Words? What kind of words?	27	4	10
384	  Funeral words. I dont know how the free folk do it.	27	4	10
385	  Do what?	27	4	10
386	  Say farewell.	27	4	10
387	  The dead cant hear us, boy.	27	4	10
388	  Snow.	27	4	10
389	  Did you love her?	27	4	10
390	  She loved you.	27	4	10
391	  She told you?	27	4	10
392	  No.	27	4	10
393	  All she ever talked about was killing you.	27	4	10
394	  Thats how I know.	27	4	10
395	  She belongs in the North.	28	4	10
396	  The real North.	28	4	10
397	  You understand me?	28	4	10
398	 (wind howling)	29	4	10
399	 (groaning)	29	4	10
400	  We can stop. We can rest.	29	4	10
401	  Well rest with the three-eyed raven.	29	4	10
402	  Were not going to make it.	30	4	10
403	  Were already here.	30	4	10
404	   Jojen.	30	4	10
405	  Jojen.	30	4	10
406	  Look, Jojen. Look.	30	4	10
407	 (groaning)	30	4	10
408	  Jojen! Come on!	31	4	10
409	  Help them! Now!	31	4	10
410	   Hold on to me!	31	4	10
411	  Hang on!	31	4	10
412	  Hodor.  Help them!	31	4	10
413	  Hodor.	31	4	10
414	  (growling)  Hodor!	31	4	10
415	  (screeching)	31	4	10
416	  (grunts)	32	4	10
417	  Hodor!	32	4	10
418	  (growling)	32	4	10
419	  Hodor. (whimpering)	32	4	10
420	  Hodor!	32	4	10
421	   Bran!	32	4	10
422	  Save yourself, now!	33	4	10
423	  (grunting)	33	4	10
424	  (shouts)	33	4	10
425	    Come with me, Brandon Stark.	33	4	10
426	  (gasping)	33	4	10
427	  He is lost.	33	4	10
428	  Come with me or die with him.	33	4	10
429	  Go with them.	33	4	10
430	  (ice bursting)	33	4	10
431	  (slices)	34	4	10
432	  (growling)	34	4	10
433	  They cannot follow us.	34	4	10
434	  The power that moves them is powerless here.	34	4	10
435	  Who are you?	34	4	10
436	  The First Men called us the children,	34	4	10
437	  but we were born long before them.	34	4	10
438	  Come, he waits for you.	34	4	10
439	  (crow caws)	35	4	10
440	  (caws)	36	4	10
441	  Youre the three-eyed raven?	36	4	10
442	  Ive been many things.	36	4	10
443	  Now I am what you see.	36	4	10
444	  My brother, he led us to you and now he	36	4	10
445	  He knew what would happen.	36	4	10
446	  From the moment he left,	36	4	10
447	  he knew and he went anyway.	36	4	10
448	  How do you know?	36	4	10
449	  Ive been watching you.	36	4	10
450	  All of you.	36	4	10
451	  All of your lives.	36	4	10
452	  With 1,000 eyes and one.	36	4	10
453	  Now youve come to me at last,	36	4	10
454	  Brandon Stark.	36	4	10
455	  Though the hour is late.	36	4	10
456	  I didnt want anyone to die for me.	36	4	10
457	  He died so you could find what you have lost.	37	4	10
458	  Youre going to help me walk again?	37	4	10
459	  You will never walk again.	37	4	10
460	  But you will fly.	37	4	10
461	  (bird squawks)	37	4	10
462	  Podrick.	37	4	10
463	  Podrick.	37	4	10
464	  Where are the horses?	37	4	10
465	  I hobbled them last night.	37	4	10
466	  What sort of hobble?	37	4	10
467	  A figure eight like you taught me.	37	4	10
468	  If you did it like I taught you,	37	4	10
469	  then the horses would be here.	37	4	10
470	  Thieves, maybe?	37	4	10
471	  Its at least 30 miles to the Eyrie from here.	37	4	10
472	  Youre carrying the saddlebags.	37	4	10
473	  (grunting)	38	4	10
474	  People coming.	38	4	10
475	  You can shit later. Theres people coming.	38	4	10
476	  Morning.	38	4	10
477	  Morning.	38	4	10
478	  I like your sword.	38	4	10
479	  Are we getting close to the Bloody Gate?	38	4	10
480	  About 10 more miles.	38	4	10
481	  Did you hear that, Podrick?	38	4	10
482	  Only 10 more miles to the Bloody Gate.	38	4	10
483	  Are you a knight?	38	4	10
484	  No.	38	4	10
485	  But you know how to use that sword?	38	4	10
486	  I do.	38	4	10
487	  Does it have a name?	38	4	10
488	  Oathkeeper.	38	4	10
489	  Mines Needle.	38	4	10
490	  Good name.	38	4	10
491	  Who taught you how to fight?	38	4	10
492	  My father.	39	4	10
493	  Mine never wanted to.	39	4	10
494	  Said fighting was for boys.	39	4	10
495	  Mine said the same.	39	4	10
496	  But I kept fighting the boys anyway.	39	4	10
497	  Kept losing.	39	4	10
498	  Finally my father said, If youre going to do it,	39	4	10
499	  you might as well do it right.	39	4	10
500	  Seven blessings.	39	4	10
501	  Im Brienne of Tarth. This is Podrick Payne.	39	4	10
502	  You want something?	39	4	10
503	  Thats Sandor Clegane. The Hound.	39	4	10
504	  Youre Arya Stark.	39	4	10
505	  I asked if you wanted something.	39	4	10
506	  I swore to your mother I would bring you home to her.	39	4	10
507	  My mothers dead.	39	4	10
508	  I know.	39	4	10
509	  I wish I could have been there to protect her.	39	4	10
510	  Youre not a northerner.	40	4	10
511	  No, but I swore a sacred vow to protect her.	40	4	10
512	  Why didnt you?	40	4	10
513	  She commanded me to bring Jaime Lannister back to Kings Landing.	40	4	10
514	  Youre paid by the Lannisters.	40	4	10
515	  Youre here for the bounty on me.	40	4	10
516	  Im not paid by the Lannisters.	40	4	10
517	  No?	40	4	10
518	  Fancy sword youve got there.	40	4	10
519	  Whered you get it?	40	4	10
520	  Ive been looking at Lannister gold all my life.	40	4	10
521	  Go on, Brienne of fucking Tarth.	40	4	10
522	  Tell me thats not Lannister gold.	40	4	10
523	  Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.	40	4	10
524	  The Bloody Gate is 10 miles.	40	4	10
525	  I swore to your mother by the old gods	40	4	10
526	  I dont care what you swore.	40	4	10
527	  Arya!   You heard the girl.	40	4	10
528	  Shes not coming with you.  She is.	40	4	10
529	  Youre not a good listener.	40	4	10
530	  That Valyrian steel?	40	4	10
531	  I always wanted some Valyrian steel.	40	4	10
532	  Come with me, Arya. Ill take you to safety.	40	4	10
533	  Safety? Where the fucks that?	41	4	10
534	  Her aunt in the Eyrie is dead. Her mothers dead.	41	4	10
535	  Her fathers dead. Her brothers dead.	41	4	10
536	  Winterfell is a pile of rubble.	41	4	10
537	  There is no safety, you dumb bitch.	41	4	10
538	  You dont know that by now,	41	4	10
539	  youre the wrong one to watch over her.	41	4	10
540	  And thats what youre doing?	41	4	10
541	  Watching over her?	41	4	10
542	  Aye, thats what Im doing.	41	4	10
543	  (grunts)	41	4	10
544	  (panting)	41	4	10
545	  (grunts)	42	4	10
546	  I have no wish to kill you, Ser.	42	4	10

557	  Where is she?   She was just here.	44	4	10
558	  Why werent you watching her?	44	4	10
559	  I was watching you. I thought you might need some help.	44	4	10
560	  Which way, Pod? Which way did she go?	44	4	10
561	  I think that way.	44	4	10
562	   Arya!	44	4	10
563	  Arya!	44	4	10
564	  (panting)	44	4	10

567	  Big bitch saved you.	44	4	10
568	  I dont need saving.	44	4	10
569	  No, not you. Youre a real killer.	44	4	10
570	  With your water dancing	44	4	10
571	  and your Needle.	44	4	10
572	  You gonna die?	45	4	10

578	  Killed by a woman.	45	4	10
579	  (chuckles)	45	4	10

589	  Im ready.	46	4	10
590	  Go on, girl.	46	4	10
591	  Another name off your list.	46	4	10
592	  You kept promising me.	46	4	10
593	  I cut down your butchers boy.	46	4	10
594	  The ginger.	46	4	10
595	  He was begging for mercy.	46	4	10
596	  Please, Ser. Please dont kill me.	46	4	10
597	  Please, please.	46	4	10
598	  Bled all over my horse.	46	4	10

600	  And your sister.	46	4	10
601	  Your pretty sister.	46	4	10
602	  I should have taken her.	46	4	10
603	  That night the Blackwater burned.	46	4	10
604	  I should have fucked her bloody.	46	4	10
605	  At least Id have one happy memory.	46	4	10
606	  Do I have to beg you?	47	4	10
607	  Do it.	47	4	10
608	  Do it.	47	4	10
609	  Do it.	47	4	10

616	  (footsteps)	48	4	10
617	  Oh, get on with it, you son of a whore.	48	4	10
618	  Is that any way to speak about our mother?	48	4	10
619	  What are you doing?	48	4	10
620	  What do you think Im doing?	48	4	10
621	  A galleys waiting in the bay bound for the Free Cities.	48	4	10
622	  Whos helping you?  Varys.	48	4	10
623	  Varys?  You have more friends than you thought.	48	4	10
624	  Theres a locked door at the top of the stairs.	48	4	10
625	  Knock on it twice, then twice again.	48	4	10
626	  Varys will open.	48	4	10
627	  I suppose this is good-bye, then.	48	4	10
628	  Farewell, little brother.	49	4	10
629	  Jaime.	49	4	10
630	  Thank you for my life.	49	4	10
631	  Quickly now.	49	4	10
632	  Tywin?	50	4	10
633	  My lion.	50	4	10

637	  (gasping)	51	4	10
638	  (whimpers)	51	4	10
639	  Im sorry.	51	4	10
640	  (exhales)	52	4	10
641	  Im sorry.	52	4	10
642	  (crossbow lever dragging)	52	4	10
643	  (door creaks)	52	4	10
644	  Tyrion.	52	4	10
645	  Put down the crossbow.	52	4	10
646	  Who released you?	52	4	10
647	  Your brother, I expect.	52	4	10
648	  He always had a soft spot for you.	53	4	10
649	  Come, well go and talk in my chambers.	53	4	10
650	  This is how you want to speak to me, hmm?	53	4	10
651	  Shaming your father has always given you pleasure.	53	4	10
652	  All my life	53	4	10
653	  youve wanted me dead.	53	4	10
654	  Yes.	53	4	10
655	  But you refused to die.	53	4	10
656	  I respect that.	53	4	10
657	  Even admire it.	53	4	10
658	  You fight for whats yours.	53	4	10
659	  Id never let them execute you.	53	4	10
660	  Is that what you fear?	53	4	10
661	  Ill never let Ilyn Payne take your head.	53	4	10
662	  Youre a Lannister.	53	4	10
663	  Youre my son.	53	4	10
664	  I loved her.	53	4	10
665	  Who?	53	4	10
666	  Shae.	53	4	10
667	  Oh, Tyrion.	53	4	10
668	  Put down that crossbow.  I murdered her.	53	4	10
669	  With my own hands.	53	4	10
670	  It doesnt matter.  Doesnt matter?	54	4	10
671	  She was a whore.	54	4	10
672	  Say that word again  And what?	54	4	10
673	  Youll kill your own father in the privy?	54	4	10
674	  No.	54	4	10
675	  Youre my son.	54	4	10
676	  Now, enough of this nonsense.	54	4	10
677	  I am your son and you sentenced me to die.	54	4	10
678	  You knew I didnt poison Joffrey,	54	4	10
679	  but you sentenced me all the same.	54	4	10
680	  Why?  Enough.	54	4	10
681	  Well go back to my chambers	54	4	10
682	  and speak with some dignity.	54	4	10
683	  I cant go back there. Shes in there.	54	4	10
684	  Youre afraid of a dead whore?	54	4	10
685	  (groans)	54	4	10
686	  You shot me.	54	4	10
687	  (groans)	54	4	10
688	  Youre no son of mine.	54	4	10
689	  I am your son.	55	4	10
690	  I have always been your son.	55	4	10
691	  (groans)	55	4	10
692	  What have you done?	55	4	10
693	  Quickly.	55	4	10
694	  Trust me, my friend. I brought you this far.	55	4	10
695	  (bells tolling)	55	4	10
696	  I want to see the captain.	57	4	10
697	  Youre seeing him.	57	4	10
698	  I want to go north to the Wall.	57	4	10
699	  No, you dont.	57	4	10
700	  I can pay.	57	4	10
701	  There is nothing in the North but ice and war and pirates.	57	4	10
702	  I wouldnt need a cabin. Please.	57	4	10
703	  I could work scrubbing the floors.	57	4	10
704	  Im not going north, child. Im going home.	57	4	10
705	  Wheres home?  The Free City of Braavos.	57	4	10
706	  Wait. I have something else.	57	4	10
707	  More silver wont make a difference.	57	4	10
708	  Its not silver. Its iron.	57	4	10
709	  This	57	4	10
710	  How did you	57	4	10
711	  Valar morghulis.	57	4	10
712	  Valar dohaeris.	57	4	10
713	  Of course, you shall have a cabin.	58	4	10

0	 1 Our father has instructed us to tell you	0	3	7
1	 that his alliance with the North can continue	0	3	7
2	 if his terms are met.	0	3	7
3	 Lord Frey requires Lord Edmure	0	3	7
4	 to wed one of his daughters.	0	3	7
5	 It's hard to say which of the four of us	0	3	7
6	 is getting the worst of this arrangement.	0	3	7
7	 Probably Sansa.	0	3	7
8	 Though Loras will certainly come to know	0	3	7
9	 a deep and singular misery.	0	3	7
10	 Who's going to tell her?	0	3	7
11	 Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion.	0	3	7
12	 I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding.	0	3	7
13	 Yes, it should be quite a wedding.	0	3	7
14	 I will allow you to go to King's Landing	0	3	7
15	 as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made.	0	3	7
16	 And you will swear to tell your father	0	3	7
17	 that I had nothing to do with your maiming.	0	3	7
18	 - My lady. - She won't be going with you.	0	3	7
19	 _	0	3	7
20	 _	0	3	7
21	 _	0	3	7
22	 Let's play a game.	0	3	7
23	 Which body part do you need the least?	0	3	7
24	 - How many times has the Lord brought him back? - Six.	0	3	7
25	 He sent you to us for a reason.	1	3	7
26	 You have someone He needs.	1	3	7
27	 You told me I could be one of you.	1	3	7
28	 You told me this was a brotherhood.	1	3	7
29	 You will make kings rise and fall.	1	3	7
30	 The visions take their toll.	1	3	7
31	 He's having one now?	1	3	7
32	 - I saw Jon Snow. - At Castle Black?	1	3	7
33	 He was on the wrong side of the Wall,	1	3	7
34	 surrounded by enemies.	1	3	7
35		3	3	7
36	 How far are we?	3	3	7
37	 About a week, I think.	3	3	7
38	 You think? You don't know?	3	3	7
39	 When we went to Castle Black, we took the kingsroad.	3	3	7
40	 You and your roads.	3	3	7
41	 Is that how you lot do your fighting?	3	3	7
42	 You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?	4	3	7
43	 Most of the time, yes.	4	3	7
44	 How do the men holding the banners fight?	4	3	7
45	 They don't, really.	4	3	7
46	 It's a great honor to carry your house sigil.	4	3	7
47	 And the drummers-- is that a great honor, too?	4	3	7
48	 Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.	4	3	7
49	 So what good are they?	4	3	7
50	 - They help the men march. - How?	4	3	7
51	 Well, it's-- it's the rhythm.	4	3	7
52	 Oh, you mean right foot, left foot,	4	3	7
53	 right foot, left foot, right foot?	4	3	7
54	 You need help remembering that?	4	3	7
55	 When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black,	4	3	7
56	 we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming.	4	3	7
57	 No.	4	3	7
58	 No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire	4	3	7
59	 the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming.	4	3	7
60	 You know nothing, Jon Snow.	4	3	7
61	 She's right, you don't.	5	3	7
62	 I know you cut me loose on the Wall.	5	3	7
63	 Cut her loose, too.	5	3	7
64	 Do you see her sulking about it?	5	3	7
65	 That's because she understands the way things are.	5	3	7
66	 And are you gonna share it with me?	5	3	7
67	 The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?	5	3	7
68	 People work together when it suits them.	5	3	7
69	 They're loyal when it suits them.	5	3	7
70	 They love each other when it suits them.	5	3	7
71	 And they kill each other when it suits them.	5	3	7
72	 She knows that, you don't.	5	3	7
73	 Which is why you'll never hold onto her.	5	3	7
74	 That rain will cost us another day.	5	3	7
75	 Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.	6	3	7
76	 Lord Walder is prickly by nature.	6	3	7
77	 Prickly? That what you call it?	6	3	7
78	 Might be the least pleasant man I've ever met.	6	3	7
79	 - Yes, and that is why-- - I've seen wet shits	6	3	7
80	 I liked better than Walder Frey.	6	3	7
81	 Apologies, Your Grace.	6	3	7
82	 Spent too many years around lancers and pikemen.	6	3	7
83	 I've spent the last two years nursing wounded men,	6	3	7
84	 watching them bleed and die.	6	3	7
85	 I'm not afraid of wet shits.	6	3	7
86	 Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.	6	3	7
87	 He can take it as he likes.	6	3	7
88	 He's getting the wedding he wanted.	6	3	7
89	 He's getting a wedding.	6	3	7
90	 It was a king he wanted.	6	3	7
91	 Edmure is the best match a Frey has had	6	3	7
92	 in the history of their house.	6	3	7
93	 We should all get some sleep.	6	3	7
94	 If you don't put some clothes on,	8	3	7
95	 I can't promise I won't attack you again.	8	3	7
96	 Attack. Attack.	8	3	7
97	 Who are you writing?	8	3	7
98	 My mother.	8	3	7
99	 - Is that Valyrian? - Gaaa.	8	3	7
100	 Gaaa?	8	3	7
101	 Say hello for me.	9	3	7
102	 Rytsas.	9	3	7
103	" ""Ritsas."""	9	3	7
104	 That was close enough.	9	3	7
105	 Does she know her daughter's a queen?	9	3	7
106	 Not yet.	9	3	7
107	 That will be a surprise, I expect.	9	3	7
108	 Many surprises for her.	9	3	7
109	 How am I supposed to sit here planning a war	9	3	7
110	 when you're over there looking like that?	9	3	7
111	 Will you come with me one day to Volantis?	9	3	7
112	 When all this is over?	9	3	7
113	 I will.	9	3	7
114	 I promise.	9	3	7
115	 I know she'd love to meet you.	9	3	7
116	 And her grandchild.	10	3	7
117	 What, now?	10	3	7
118	 Are you certain?	10	3	7
119	 Are you angry with me?	10	3	7
120	 Angry?	10	3	7
121	 You're my queen.	10	3	7
122	 And I have your little prince or princess inside me.	10	3	7
123	 Maybe one of each.	10	3	7
124	 Don't get greedy.	10	3	7
125	 Can you leave the war for one night?	10	3	7
126	 I love you.	10	3	7
127	 Do you hear me?	11	3	7
128	 I love you.	11	3	7
129	 Most men fuck like dogs.	11	3	7
130	 No grace, no skill.	11	3	7
131	 A few dozen thrusts and done.	11	3	7
132	 You need to be patient. Give her time.	11	3	7
133	 Your cock shouldn't go near her	11	3	7
134	 till she's slick as a baby seal.	11	3	7
135	 And then you go inside,	11	3	7
136	 but slowly.	11	3	7
137	 Don't jam it in like you're spearing a pig.	11	3	7
138	 Come on!	11	3	7
139	 Hey, come on.	11	3	7
140	 You think he loves you, is that it?	12	3	7
141	 What did he tell you? He's gonna make you his lady	12	3	7
142	 and live with you in some castle?	12	3	7
143	 No, he didn't tell me anything.	12	3	7
144	 He barely talks.	12	3	7
145	 I've seen you two whispering in the night,	12	3	7
146	 giggling like a pair of girls.	12	3	7
147	 What, you're jealous?	12	3	7
148	 Of course I'm jealous.	12	3	7
149	 You should be with one of your own.	12	3	7
150	 And you're one of my own?	12	3	7
151	 I've never heard a kind word from your mouth.	12	3	7
152	 You would if you were mine.	12	3	7
153	 I'd tell you that you're beautiful	12	3	7
154	 and fierce and wild.	12	3	7
155	 I'd be good to you.	12	3	7
156	 You love him?	12	3	7
157	 'Cause he's pretty? Is that it?	12	3	7
158	 You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes?	13	3	7
159	 - You think pretty is gonna make you happy? - Don't touch me.	13	3	7
160	 You won't love him so much when you find out what he really is.	13	3	7
161	 Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape,	13	3	7
162	 to come here to the capital.	13	3	7
163	 See the southern knights and their painted armor	13	3	7
164	 and King's Landing after dark--	13	3	7
165	 all the candles burning in all those windows.	13	3	7
166	 I'm stupid.	13	3	7
167	 A stupid little girl	13	3	7
168	 with stupid dreams who never learns.	13	3	7
169	 Come on.	13	3	7
170	 Come walk with me.	13	3	7
171	 I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room.	13	3	7
172	 I'd never seen anyone who looked so unhappy.	13	3	7
173	 I want very much for you to be happy, Sansa,	14	3	7
174	 and so does my grandmother.	14	3	7
175	 You would have been happy at Highgarden.	14	3	7
176	 But women in our position	14	3	7
177	 must make the best of our circumstances.	14	3	7
178	 How do I make the best of my circumstances?	14	3	7
179	 I have to marry him.	14	3	7
180	 - Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you? - No.	14	3	7
181	 Has he been kind to you?	14	3	7
182	 He's tried.	14	3	7
183	 You don't want him, though.	14	3	7
184	 He's a Lannister.	14	3	7
185	 Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn't you say?	14	3	7
186	 I'm sorry.	14	3	7
187	 Here I am complaining to you...	14	3	7
188	 My son will be king.	14	3	7
189	 Sons learn from their mothers.	14	3	7
190	 I plan to teach mine a great deal.	14	3	7
191	 And your son, if I'm not mistaken,	14	3	7
192	 your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock	14	3	7
193	 and the North someday.	14	3	7
194	 What?	15	3	7
195	 My son...	15	3	7
196	 with him.	15	3	7
197	 I'll have to--	15	3	7
198	 we'll have to--	15	3	7
199	 If it's the pain you're worried about--	15	3	7
200	 I'm not afraid of the pain.	15	3	7
201	 Not after what Joffrey's done to me.	15	3	7
202	 What is it, then?	15	3	7
203	 He's rather good-looking even with the scar.	15	3	7
204	 Especially with the scar.	15	3	7
205	 He's a dwarf.	15	3	7
206	 And Loras--	15	3	7
207	 Loras.	15	3	7
208	 Some women like tall men.	15	3	7
209	 Some like short men.	15	3	7
210	 Some like hairy men. Some like bald men.	15	3	7
211	 Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men,	15	3	7
212	 pretty girls.	15	3	7
213	 Most women don't know what they like until they've tried it.	15	3	7
214	 And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little	15	3	7
215	 before we're old and gray.	15	3	7
216	 Tyrion may surprise you.	16	3	7
217	 From what I've heard, he's quite experienced.	16	3	7
218	 And that's a good thing?	16	3	7
219	 It can be.	16	3	7
220	 We're very complicated, you know.	16	3	7
221	 Pleasing us takes practice.	16	3	7
222	 How do you know all this?	16	3	7
223	 Did your mother teach you?	16	3	7
224	 Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me.	16	3	7
225	 She's a child.	16	3	7
226	 She's a foot taller than you.	16	3	7
227	 A tall child.	16	3	7
228	 What's the youngest you've ever had?	16	3	7
229	 Not that young.	16	3	7
230	 How much older?	16	3	7
231	 Older.	16	3	7
232	 You're a lord, she's a lady.	16	3	7
233	 And a beauty at that.	16	3	7
234	 I don't see the problem.	16	3	7
235	 Shae isn't going to like it.	16	3	7
236	 Shae is a whore.	16	3	7
237	 Are you gonna marry her? Eh?	16	3	7
238	 How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?	17	3	7
239	 I should never have told you about that.	17	3	7
240	 You want Shae, keep her. Wed one and bed the other.	17	3	7
241	 All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl.	17	3	7
242	 He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day.	17	3	7
243	 You can rule the North in his name.	17	3	7
244	 You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own.	17	3	7
245	 Two women to despise me	17	3	7
246	 and a whole kingdom to join them.	17	3	7
247	 You waste time trying to get people to love you,	17	3	7
248	 you'll end up the most popular dead man in town.	17	3	7
249	 You want to fuck that Stark girl.	17	3	7
250	 You just don't want to admit it.	17	3	7
251	 I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head.	17	3	7
252	 The ones already there don't need company.	17	3	7
253	 You pay me to kill people who bother you.	17	3	7
254	 Evil notions come free.	17	3	7
255	 Your Grace.	18	3	7
256	 Grandfather.	18	3	7
257	 You wanted to speak to me?	18	3	7
258	 Yes.	18	3	7
259	 I'd like a report on the meetings of my small council.	18	3	7
260	 You're welcome to attend the meetings	18	3	7
261	 of your small council, Your Grace.	18	3	7
262	 Any or all of them.	18	3	7
263	 I've been very busy.	18	3	7
264	 Many important matters require a king's attention.	18	3	7
265	 Of course.	18	3	7
266	 You've been holding the council meetings	18	3	7
267	 in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber.	18	3	7
268	 I have, yes.	19	3	7
269	 May I ask why?	19	3	7
270	 The Tower of the Hand is where I work.	19	3	7
271	 To walk from there to here would take time,	19	3	7
272	 time I could otherwise spend productively.	19	3	7
273	 So if I wanted to attend a council meeting,	19	3	7
274	 I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?	19	3	7
275	 We could arrange to have you carried.	19	3	7
276	 Tell me about the Targaryen girl	19	3	7
277	 in the east and her dragons.	19	3	7
278	 Where did you hear about this?	19	3	7
279	 Is it true?	19	3	7
280	 Apparently so.	19	3	7
281	 Don't you think we ought to do something about it?	20	3	7
282	 When I was Hand of the King	20	3	7
283	 under your father's predecessor,	20	3	7
284	 the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons	20	3	7
285	 were kept in this room.	20	3	7
286	 The skull of the last of them	20	3	7
287	 was right here.	20	3	7
288	 It was the size of an apple.	20	3	7
289	 And the biggest was the size of a carriage.	20	3	7
290	 Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged	20	3	7
291	 died 300 years ago.	20	3	7
292	 Curiosities on the far side of the world	20	3	7
293	 are no threat to us.	20	3	7
294	 But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities	20	3	7
295	 and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?	20	3	7
296	 Because we have been told as much by the many experts	20	3	7
297	 who serve the realm by counseling the king	20	3	7
298	 on matters about which he knows nothing.	20	3	7
299	 But I haven't been counseled.	20	3	7
300	 You are being counseled at this very moment.	20	3	7
301	 I should be consulted about such things.	21	3	7
302	 From now on, I will see to it	21	3	7
303	 that you are appropriately consulted	21	3	7
304	 on important matters	21	3	7
305	 whenever necessary.	21	3	7
306	 Your Grace.	21	3	7
307	 Yunkai.	21	3	7
308	 The Yellow City.	21	3	7
309	 The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers.	21	3	7
310	 We can defeat them.	21	3	7
311	 On the field, with ease.	21	3	7
312	 But they won't meet us on the field.	21	3	7
313	 They have provisions, patience, and strong walls.	21	3	7
314	 If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls	21	3	7
315	 and chip away at us, man by man.	21	3	7
316	 I don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.	22	3	7
317	 We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi.	22	3	7
318	 Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros	22	3	7
319	 or the Iron Throne.	22	3	7
320	 How many slaves are there in Yunkai?	22	3	7
321	 200,000, if not more.	22	3	7
322	 Then we have 200,000 reasons to take the city.	22	3	7
323	 _	22	3	7
324	 _	22	3	7
325	 _	22	3	7
326	 Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz	24	3	7
327	 of that ancient and honorable house,	24	3	7
328	 master of men and speaker to savages,	24	3	7
329	 to offer terms of peace.	24	3	7
330	 Noble lord, you are in the presence	24	3	7
331	 of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen,	24	3	7
332	 Queen of the Andals and the First Men,	24	3	7
333	 Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea,	24	3	7
334	 Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons.	24	3	7
335	 You may approach. Sit.	24	3	7
336	 Will the noble lord take refreshment?	24	3	7
337	 Ancient and glorious is Yunkai.	25	3	7
338	 Our empire was old	25	3	7
339	 before dragons stirred in old Valyria.	25	3	7
340	 Many an army has broken against our walls.	25	3	7
341	 You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi.	25	3	7
342	 Good. My Unsullied need practice.	25	3	7
343	 I was told to blood them early.	25	3	7
344	 If blood is your desire, blood shall flow.	25	3	7
345	 But why?	25	3	7
346	 'Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor.	25	3	7
347	 But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people.	25	3	7
348	 The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift	25	3	7
349	 for the silver queen.	25	3	7
350	 There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship.	25	3	7
351	 - My ship? - Yes, khaleesi.	26	3	7
352	 As I said, we are a generous people.	26	3	7
353	 You shall have as many ships as you require.	26	3	7
354	 And what do you ask in return?	26	3	7
355	 All we ask is that you make use of these ships.	26	3	7
356	 Sail them back to Westeros where you belong	26	3	7
357	 and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace.	26	3	7
358	 I have a gift for you as well.	26	3	7
359	 - Your life. - My life?	26	3	7
360	 And the lives of your wise masters.	26	3	7
361	 But I also want something in return.	26	3	7
362	 You will release every slave in Yunkai.	26	3	7
363	 Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food,	26	3	7
364	 clothing, and property as they can carry	26	3	7
365	 as payment for their years of servitude.	26	3	7
366	 Reject this gift,	26	3	7
367	 and I shall show you no mercy.	26	3	7
368	 You are mad.	26	3	7
369	 We are not Astapor or Qarth.	26	3	7
370	 We are Yunkai and we have powerful friends.	27	3	7
371	 Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you.	27	3	7
372	 Those who survive, we shall enslave once more.	27	3	7
373	 Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well.	27	3	7
374	 You swore me safe conduct.	27	3	7
375	 I did, but my dragons made no promises.	27	3	7
376	 And you threatened their mother.	27	3	7
377	 Take the gold.	27	3	7
378	 My gold. You gave it to me, remember?	27	3	7
379	 And I shall put it to good use.	27	3	7
380	 You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you.	27	3	7
381	 Now get out.	27	3	7
382	 The Yunkish are a proud people.	27	3	7
383	 They will not bend.	27	3	7
384	 And what happens to things that don't bend?	27	3	7
385	 He said he had powerful friends.	27	3	7
386	 Who was he talking about?	28	3	7
387	 I don't know.	28	3	7
388	 Find out.	28	3	7
389	 Chains?	28	3	7
390	 Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport.	28	3	7
391	 Smithed in Casterly Rock.	28	3	7
392	 Golden chains.	28	3	7
393	 You could buy a ship with these.	28	3	7
394	 - Do I need a ship? - What?	28	3	7
395	 - Am I going somewhere? - Of course you're not going anywhere.	28	3	7
396	 So, am I invited to your wedding?	28	3	7
397	 I didn't ask for this marriage.	28	3	7
398	 - I didn't want it. - No?	28	3	7
399	 She's a beautiful girl. You said so yourself.	28	3	7
400	 That doesn't mean that--	28	3	7
401	 this is duty, not desire.	28	3	7
402	 Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her?	29	3	7
403	 I don't have a choice. My father--	29	3	7
404	 Does not rule the world.	29	3	7
405	 We can still go across the Narrow Sea.	29	3	7
406	 What would I do there?	29	3	7
407	 Juggle?	29	3	7
408	 I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.	29	3	7
409	 And I'm Shae the funny whore.	29	3	7
410	 My feelings for you have not changed.	29	3	7
411	 I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.	29	3	7
412	 While I empty her chamber pot	29	3	7
413	 and lick your cock when you're bored?	29	3	7
414	 I swear to you it will not be like that.	29	3	7
415	 No? What will it be like?	29	3	7
416	 I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city.	29	3	7
417	 You will have fine clothes,	29	3	7
418	 guards to keep you safe, servants.	29	3	7
419	 Any children we might have	29	3	7
420	 will be well provided for.	29	3	7
421	 Children? You think I want children	29	3	7
422	 who can never see their father?	30	3	7
423	 Who would be killed in their sleep	30	3	7
424	 if their grandfather found out about them?	30	3	7
425	 Listen.	30	3	7
426	 Listen to me, my lady.	30	3	7
427	 - I'm not your lady. - You are.	30	3	7
428	 You'll always be my lady.	30	3	7
429	 I'm your whore.	30	3	7
430	 And when you are tired of fucking me,	30	3	7
431	 I will be nothing.	30	3	7
432	 - What happened? - Wildfire.	31	3	7
433	 I should have been here.	31	3	7
434	 After all the running and fighting,	31	3	7
435	 here I am, back where I started.	31	3	7
436	 Do you miss it?	31	3	7
437	 - King's Landing? - Your father's house.	31	3	7
438	 Never had a father. Never wanted one.	31	3	7
439	 Haven't you ever wondered where your strength came from?	31	3	7
440	 Your talent for fighting?	31	3	7
441	 I'm lowborn.	31	3	7
442	 As low as can be. My mother was a tavern wench.	31	3	7
443	 Mine was a slave.	31	3	7
444	 So was I.	31	3	7
445	 Bought and sold,	31	3	7
446	 scourged and branded,	31	3	7
447	 until the Lord of Light reached down,	31	3	7
448	 took me in his hand and raised me up.	31	3	7
449	 I was born in Flea Bottom.	31	3	7
450	 Your blood is noble.	31	3	7
451	 Are you saying my father,	31	3	7
452	 he was some lord or...	31	3	7
453	 There.	31	3	7
454	 Your father's house.	31	3	7
455	 I'm just a bastard.	32	3	7
456	 The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon,	32	3	7
457	 First of His Name, King of the Andals	32	3	7
458	 and the First Men.	32	3	7
459	 Why do you think the gold cloaks wanted you?	32	3	7
460	 There is power in a king's blood.	32	3	7
461	 Come sit by the fire, child.	32	3	7
462	 Not talking, eh?	32	3	7
463	 That's a first.	32	3	7
464	 I don't talk to traitors.	32	3	7
465	 I didn't like giving up the boy.	32	3	7
466	 But you did.	33	3	7
467	 You took the gold and you gave him up.	33	3	7
468	 The Red God is the one true god.	33	3	7
469	 You've seen his power.	33	3	7
470	 When he commands, we obey.	33	3	7
471	 He's not my one true god.	33	3	7
472	 No? Who's yours?	33	3	7
473	 Death.	33	3	7
474	 Spotted a Lannister raiding party.	33	3	7
475	 - How many? - No more than 20.	33	3	7
476	 - How far? - Less than a day's ride south.	33	3	7
477	 What do you say, boys? Time for a lion hunt?	33	3	7
478	 Yeah!	33	3	7
479	 But what about Riverrun?	33	3	7
480	 It's not south. It's west of here.	33	3	7
481	 It will still be west of here two days from now.	33	3	7
482	 - You swore. - To take you home, and I will.	34	3	7
483	 But we need to do this first.	34	3	7
484	 Why? So you can steal their gold?	34	3	7
485	 I swear to you, this isn't--	34	3	7
486	 I don't care what you swear because you're a liar.	34	3	7
487	 You lied to Gendry, you lied to me.	34	3	7
488	 You'll lie to anyone. I hope the Lannisters kill you all.	34	3	7
489	 One day you'll understand, but now--	34	3	7
490	 - Anguy, bring her back. - Come back, girl!	34	3	7
491	 Kick all you like, wolf girl.	34	3	7
492	 Won't do you no good.	34	3	7
493	 I thought you were gone.	35	3	7
494	 Tomorrow.	35	3	7
495	 Have they told you what they plan to do with me?	35	3	7
496	 Lord Bolton's traveling tomorrow as well.	35	3	7
497	 He's going to the Twins for Edmure Tully's wedding.	35	3	7
498	 You're to remain here.	35	3	7
499	 With Locke?	35	3	7
500	 I owe you a debt.	35	3	7
501	 When Catelyn Stark released you,	35	3	7
502	 we both made a promise to her.	35	3	7
503	 Now it's your promise.	35	3	7
504	 You gave your word.	35	3	7
505	 Keep it	36	3	7
506	 and consider the debt paid.	36	3	7
507	 I will return the Stark girls to their mother.	36	3	7
508	 I swear it.	36	3	7
509	 Good-bye, Ser Jaime.	36	3	7
510	 Here. Let me.	36	3	7
511	 It will take time.	36	3	7
512	 Qyburn hopes your father will force the Citadel	37	3	7
513	 to give him back his chain.	37	3	7
514	 My father will make him Grand Maester	37	3	7
515	 if he grows me a new hand.	37	3	7
516	 You will give my regards to Lord Tywin, I trust?	37	3	7
517	 Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I couldn't make his uncle's wedding.	37	3	7
518	 The Lannisters send their regards.	37	3	7
519	 Safe journey, Kingslayer.	37	3	7
520	 Nothing to say?	37	3	7
521	 I liked you better before.	37	3	7
522	 I don't remember chopping your balls off, too.	37	3	7
523	 And don't you worry about your friend.	37	3	7
524	 We'll take good care of her.	37	3	7
525	 Shh.	38	3	7
526	 Gentle, my lord.	38	3	7
527	 Gentle.	38	3	7
528	 Shh shh shh.	38	3	7
529	 Myranda knows what she's doing.	38	3	7
530	 Let her.	38	3	7
531	 She trained as a septa, only...	38	3	7
532	 she had other urges.	38	3	7
533	 So did the septons, only they lied about it.	38	3	7
534	 Where is he?	39	3	7
535	 Who, my lord?	39	3	7
536	 There's no one here but you, me, and Violet.	39	3	7
537	 Please.	39	3	7
538	 Don't you want us to see it?	39	3	7
539	 Oh, come on. Let us see it.	39	3	7
540	 Everybody talks about it.	39	3	7
541	 He sent you.	39	3	7
542	 Who sent us?	39	3	7
543	 We sent ourselves, Lord Greyjoy.	39	3	7
544	 We heard so much about it.	39	3	7
545	 - Please. - Oh!	39	3	7
546	 There it is.	39	3	7
547	 Oh.	39	3	7
548	 Do you think we're ugly?	39	3	7
549	 He thinks we're ugly.	39	3	7
550	 Well, he's been through so much.	39	3	7
551	 Look at his poor face.	39	3	7
552	 Help me.	39	3	7
553	 If he comes back...	39	3	7
554	 We need to make him feel better.	39	3	7
555	 And how can we make him feel better?	40	3	7
556	 I have an idea.	40	3	7
557	 Oh, she's shy.	40	3	7
558	 You know how they are, these religious girls.	40	3	7
559	 Maybe he doesn't know how we are.	40	3	7
560	 Oh.	40	3	7
561	 I felt something.	40	3	7
562	 Oh, Lord Greyjoy.	40	3	7
563	 - As good as they say? - Mmm.	41	3	7
564	 And why should you get all the fun?	41	3	7
565	 What? You like her better?	41	3	7
566	 Plenty there for both of us.	41	3	7
567	 I was here first.	41	3	7
568	 I'm sorry. I'm sorry.	41	3	7
569	 Terrible timing.	41	3	7
570	 But I was getting jealous.	42	3	7
571	 Well?	42	3	7
572	 Should we see this cock everyone's always going on about?	42	3	7
573	 Everyone knows you love girls.	42	3	7
574	 I bet you always thought they loved you back.	42	3	7
575	 Your famous cock must be very precious to you.	42	3	7
576	 Would you say it's your most precious part?	42	3	7
577	 Please.	42	3	7
578	 No.	42	3	7
579	 No! Mercy, please!	42	3	7
580	 Please, mercy! Mercy!	43	3	7
581	 This is mercy.	43	3	7
582	 I'm not killing you.	43	3	7
583	 Just making a few alterations.	43	3	7
584	 No! No! No!	43	3	7
585	 Please, no! No!	43	3	7
586	 No! No, please! Please!	43	3	7
587	 You're gonna scare it off.	43	3	7
588	 I'm not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it.	43	3	7
589	 It's too far away.	43	3	7
590	 Is that a palace?	43	3	7
591	 It's a windmill.	44	3	7
592	 Windmill.	44	3	7
593	 Who built it? Some king?	44	3	7
594	 Just the men who used to live here.	44	3	7
595	 They must have been great builders,	44	3	7
596	 stacking stones so high.	44	3	7
597	 Winterfell has towers three times that size.	44	3	7
598	" ""I'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell."	44	3	7
599	 My daddy was a fancy lord	44	3	7
600	" and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds."""	44	3	7
601	 If you're impressed by a windmill,	44	3	7
602	 you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell.	44	3	7
603	 What's swooning?	44	3	7
604	 Fainting.	44	3	7
605	 What's fainting?	44	3	7
606	 When a girl sees blood and collapses.	44	3	7
607	 Why would a girl see blood and collapse?	44	3	7
608	 Well...	44	3	7
609	 not all girls are like you.	44	3	7
610	 Well, girls see more blood than boys.	44	3	7
611	 Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow?	44	3	7
612	 Oh, a spider!	44	3	7
613	 Save me, Jon Snow.	45	3	7
614	 My dress is made of the purest silk	45	3	7
615	 from Tralalalaleeday.	45	3	7
616	 I'd like to see you in a silk dress.	45	3	7
617	 Would you?	45	3	7
618	 So I could tear it off you.	45	3	7
619	 Well, you rip my pretty silk dress,	45	3	7
620	 I'll blacken your eye.	45	3	7
621	 Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.	45	3	7
622	 Or maybe one day I'll take you there.	45	3	7
623	 After we've taken our land back.	45	3	7
624	 Ygritte.	45	3	7
625	 You won't win.	45	3	7
626	 I know your people are brave, no one denies that.	45	3	7
627	 - You know nothing-- - Six times in the last thousand years,	45	3	7
628	 a King-beyond-the-Wall has attacked the kingdoms.	46	3	7
629	 - Six times they failed. - And how do you know that?	46	3	7
630	 Every boy in the North knows it.	46	3	7
631	 We grow up learning it.	46	3	7
632	 Where the battles were fought,	46	3	7
633	 the names of the heroes, who died where.	46	3	7
634	 Six times you've invaded	46	3	7
635	 and six times you've failed.	46	3	7
636	 The seventh will be the same.	46	3	7
637	 - Mance is different. - You don't have the discipline.	46	3	7
638	 You don't have the training. Your army is no army.	46	3	7
639	 You don't know how to fight together.	46	3	7
640	 - You don't know that. - I do.	46	3	7
641	 I know it.	46	3	7
642	 If you attack the Wall, you'll die.	46	3	7
643	 All of you.	46	3	7
644	 All of us.	46	3	7
645	 You're mine	47	3	7
646	 as I'm yours.	47	3	7
647	 And if we die, we die.	47	3	7
648	 But first we'll live.	47	3	7
649	 Yes, first we'll live.	47	3	7
650	 What's he going on about?	47	3	7
651	 And how come he always gets to sit and chat	47	3	7
652	 while we do all the work?	47	3	7
653	 Hodor.	47	3	7
654	 - That's where we are. - What are you telling him?	47	3	7
655	 - It's all right, Osha. - It's not all right.	47	3	7
656	 You think I can't hear you every day?	47	3	7
657	 Filling his head with black magic.	48	3	7
658	 Talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and worse.	48	3	7
659	 - Leave him alone. - He can speak for himself.	48	3	7
660	 I don't fill his head with anything.	48	3	7
661	 So what do you talk about?	48	3	7
662	 What's happening to him and what that means.	48	3	7
663	 Go on, then. Tell us what it means.	48	3	7
664	 It's not like that.	48	3	7
665	 I wish I could tell him all the answers.	48	3	7
666	 It would be much easier.	48	3	7
667	 I don't want you talking to him anymore.	48	3	7
668	 Until we get to your brother at Castle Black.	48	3	7
669	 - We're not going to Castle Black. - What did you say?	48	3	7
670	 I told you already. Jon Snow isn't there.	48	3	7
671	 Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.	48	3	7
672	 Oh, no. I'm not going back there.	48	3	7
673	 Your brother is at Castle Black. That's where we're going.	48	3	7
674	 Look at me.	48	3	7
675	 The raven's been coming to me	48	3	7
676	 ever since I fell from that tower.	48	3	7
677	 He wants me to find him.	48	3	7
678	 I don't have my legs anymore.	48	3	7
679	 This is what I have now.	48	3	7
680	 You have a family.	49	3	7
681	 You need to go back to Castle Black	49	3	7
682	 so you can get back to them where you belong.	49	3	7
683	 What if I belong in the North?	49	3	7
684	 What if I fell from that tower for a reason?	49	3	7
685	 Is that what he's telling you?	49	3	7
686	 That it's all for a reason?	49	3	7
687	 All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you?	49	3	7
688	 I wish it were true, little lord.	49	3	7
689	 But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone.	49	3	7
690	 You don't understand. You don't know.	49	3	7
691	 You don't know. None of you know.	49	3	7
692	 None of you have been up there.	49	3	7
693	 I had a man once.	49	3	7
694	 A good man.	49	3	7
695	 Bruni, his name was.	49	3	7
696	 I was his and he was mine.	49	3	7
697	 But one night Bruni disappears.	49	3	7
698	 People said he left me,	49	3	7
699	 but I knew him.	49	3	7
700	 He'd never leave me. Not for long.	49	3	7
701	 I knew he'd come back.	50	3	7
702	 And he did.	50	3	7
703	 He came in through the back of the hut.	50	3	7
704	 Only it wasn't Bruni.	50	3	7
705	 Not really.	50	3	7
706	 His skin was pale	50	3	7
707	 like a dead man's.	50	3	7
708	 His eyes bluer than clear sky.	50	3	7
709	 He came at me,	50	3	7
710	 grabbed me by the neck	50	3	7
711	 and squeezed so hard	50	3	7
712	 I could feel the life slipping out of me.	50	3	7
713	 I don't know how I got the knife.	50	3	7
714	 When I did, I stuck it	50	3	7
715	 deep into his heart.	50	3	7
716	 And he hardly seemed to notice.	50	3	7
717	 I had to burn our hut down with him inside.	50	3	7
718	 I didn't ask the gods what it meant.	51	3	7
719	 I didn't need to. I already knew.	51	3	7
720	 It meant the North was no place for men to be.	51	3	7
721	 Not anymore.	51	3	7
722	 I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black	51	3	7
723	 and no further.	51	3	7
724	 How is the pain, my lord?	51	3	7
725	 What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?	51	3	7
726	 Well, we've stymied the corruption.	51	3	7
727	 Yes, we've stymied the corruption.	51	3	7
728	 You're a learned man.	51	3	7
729	 All the good it's done me.	51	3	7
730	 You did well sewing up this mess.	51	3	7
731	 You're far better at this sort of work	51	3	7
732	 than Grand Maester Pycelle.	52	3	7
733	 Faint praise, my lord.	52	3	7
734	 So why did the Citadel take your chain?	52	3	7
735	 Did you fondle one boy too many?	52	3	7
736	 No, my lord. That's not my weakness.	52	3	7
737	 What is?	52	3	7
738	 Curiosity.	52	3	7
739	 The only way to treat disease is to understand disease.	52	3	7
740	 And the only way to understand it	52	3	7
741	 is to study the afflicted.	52	3	7
742	 You performed experiments on living men.	52	3	7
743	 - On dying men. - With their permission?	52	3	7
744	 My studies have given me insight	52	3	7
745	 that has saved many lives.	52	3	7
746	 Dying paupers, I assume.	52	3	7
747	 Men with no families to complain.	52	3	7
748	 You found them moaning in the poorhouse	52	3	7
749	 and had them carted back to your garret	52	3	7
750	 and opened up their bellies to see what was inside.	52	3	7
751	 How many men have you killed, my lord?	52	3	7
752	 I don't know.	53	3	7
753	 50? 100?	53	3	7
754	 Countless.	53	3	7
755	 Countless has a nice ring to it.	53	3	7
756	 And how many lives have you saved?	53	3	7
757	 Half a million.	53	3	7
758	 The population of King's Landing.	53	3	7
759	 You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal.	53	3	7
760	 Did you-- did you get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth?	53	3	7
761	 A bird flew off and a bird flew back.	53	3	7
762	 Lord Selwyn Tarth	53	3	7
763	 offered 300 gold dragons for his daughter's safe return.	53	3	7
764	 - A fair offer. - A fair offer. Locke won't take it.	53	3	7
765	 Why not?	53	3	7
766	 He's convinced Lord Tarth	53	3	7
767	 owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.	53	3	7
768	 He feels he's being cheated.	53	3	7
769	 They'd be fools to kill her.	54	3	7
770	 These men have been at war a long time.	54	3	7
771	 Most of them will be dead by winter.	54	3	7
772	 She'll be their entertainment tonight.	54	3	7
773	 Beyond tonight,	54	3	7
774	 I don't think they care very much.	54	3	7
775	 We have to return to Harrenhal.	54	3	7
776	 Why?	54	3	7
777	 I've left something behind.	54	3	7
778	 Absolutely not.	54	3	7
779	 I've got orders from Lord Bolton.	54	3	7
780	 And what are those orders?	54	3	7
781	 To deliver you to your father at King's Landing.	54	3	7
782	 You think you'll get a reward.	54	3	7
783	 I serve Lord Bolton.	54	3	7
784	 Any appreciation your father--	54	3	7
785	 You think you're getting a reward.	54	3	7
786	 Let me explain something to you.	55	3	7
787	 When my father sees me, the first thing	55	3	7
788	 he's going to ask is what happened to my hand.	55	3	7
789	 And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off.	55	3	7
790	 - I had nothing-- - Or I could tell him this man saved my life.	55	3	7
791	 We return to Harrenhal now.	55	3	7
792	 Whoa.	55	3	7
793	 - Eyes open, lads. - Be quiet.	55	3	7
794	  The bear, the bear and the maiden fair 	55	3	7
795	  From there to here, from here to there 	55	3	7
796	  All black and brown and covered in hair 	55	3	7
797	  He smelled that girl in the summer air 	55	3	7
798	  The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair! 	55	3	7
799	 Don't spare her.	56	3	7
800	 Don't spare her!	56	3	7
801	 Well, this is one shameful fucking performance.	56	3	7
802	 Stop running and fight.	56	3	7
803	 A wooden sword?	56	3	7
804	 - I thought you'd gone. - You gave her a wooden sword.	56	3	7
805	 We've only got one bear.	56	3	7
806	 I'll pay her bloody ransom.	56	3	7
807	 Gold, sapphires, whatever you want.	56	3	7
808	 Just get her out of there.	56	3	7
809	 All you lords and ladies	56	3	7
810	 still think that the only thing that matters is gold.	56	3	7
811	 This makes me happier than all your gold ever could.	56	3	7
812	 And that makes me happier than all her sapphires.	56	3	7
813	 So go buy yourself a golden hand	56	3	7
814	 and fuck yourself with it.	56	3	7
815	 Ah!	57	3	7
816	 - Get behind me. - I will not.	57	3	7
817	 What the fuck are you doing to my bear?	57	3	7
818	 Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him back	57	3	7
819	 to King's Landing alive and that's what I aim to do.	57	3	7
820	 Pull her up.	57	3	7
821	 Hold my legs.	57	3	7
822	 Pull him up!	58	3	7
823	 The bitch stays.	58	3	7
824	 We're taking her to King's Landing.	58	3	7
825	 Unless you kill me.	58	3	7
826	 She belongs to me.	58	3	7
827	 Lord Bolton's orders.	58	3	7
828	 What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton?	58	3	7
829	 Getting his pet rat a reward	58	3	7
830	 or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive?	58	3	7
831	 Well, we must be on our way.	59	3	7
832	 Sorry about the sapphires.	59	3	7

46	 From this day, you'll be my new fool.	5	2	1
47	 Thank you, Your Grace.	5	2	1
48	 And you, my lady, thank you.	5	2	1
49	 TYRION: Beloved nephew.	5	2	1
50	 We looked for you on the battlefield.	5	2	1
51	 You were nowhere to be found.	5	2	1
52	 I've been here, ruling the kingdoms.	5	2	1
53	 What a fine job you've done.	5	2	1
54	 Look at you.	5	2	1
55	 More beautiful than ever.	5	2	1
56	 And you!	5	2	1
57	 You're going to be bigger than the Hound,	5	2	1
58	 - but much better looking. - (LAUGHS)	6	2	1
59	 This one doesn't like me.	6	2	1
60	 Can't imagine why.	6	2	1
61	 - We heard you were dead. - I'm glad you're not dead.	6	2	1
62	 Me, too, dear. Death is so boring,	6	2	1
63	 especially now, with so much excitement in the world.	6	2	1
64	 My lady, I'm sorry for your loss.	6	2	1
65	 Her loss?	6	2	1
66	 Her father was a confessed traitor.	6	2	1
67	 But still her father.	6	2	1
68	 Surely, having so recently lost your own beloved father, you can sympathize.	6	2	1
69	 My father was a traitor.	6	2	1
70	 My mother and brother are traitors, too.	6	2	1
71	 I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.	6	2	1
72	 Of course you are.	6	2	1
73	 Well, enjoy your name day, Your Grace.	6	2	1
74	 Wish I could stay and celebrate,	6	2	1
75	 but there is work to be done.	6	2	1
76	 What work?	7	2	1
77	 Why are you here?	7	2	1
78	 PYCELLE: A raven arrived from the citadel this morning, Your Grace.	7	2	1
79	 (BIRD SQUAWKING)	7	2	1
80	 The conclave has met,	7	2	1
81	 considered reports from maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms,	7	2	1
82	 and declared this great summer	7	2	1
83	 done at last.	7	2	1
84	 The longest summer in living memory.	7	2	1
85	 The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter.	7	2	1
86	 PYCELLE: A common superstition.	7	2	1
87	 LITTLEFINGER: We have enough wheat for a five-year winter.	7	2	1
88	 If it lasts any longer,	7	2	1
89	 we'll have fewer peasants.	7	2	1
90	 The city's drowning in refugees, Your Grace, fleeing the war.	7	2	1
91	 We have nowhere to house them. And with winter coming, it'll only get worse.	7	2	1
92	 You command the city watch, do you not, Lord Slynt?	7	2	1
93	 I do, Your Grace.	8	2	1
94	 And are you not a lord at my command?	8	2	1
95	 I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace.	8	2	1
96	 Then do your job. Shut the gates to the peasants.	8	2	1
97	 They belong in the field, not our capital.	8	2	1
98	 Yes, Your Grace.	8	2	1
99	 (TYRION WHISTLING TUNE)	8	2	1

101	 More ravishing than ever, big sister.	8	2	1
102	 War agrees with you.	8	2	1
103	 Forgive the interruption. Carry on.	8	2	1
104	 What are you doing here?	8	2	1
105	 It's been a remarkable journey.	8	2	1
106	 I pissed off the edge of the Wall,	8	2	1
107	 I slept in a sky cell,	8	2	1
108	 I fought with the hill tribes.	8	2	1
109	 So many adventures,	8	2	1
110	 so much to be thankful for.	8	2	1
111	 What are you doing here? This is the small council.	9	2	1
112	 Yes, well, I do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings.	9	2	1
113	 Our father is Hand of the King.	9	2	1
114	 Yes, but in his absence...	9	2	1
115	 VARYS: Your father has named Lord Tyrion	9	2	1
116	 to serve as hand in his stead while he fights.	9	2	1
117	 Out! All of you out!	9	2	1
118	 I would like to know how you tricked Father into this.	9	2	1
119	 If I were capable of tricking Father, I'd be emperor of the world by now.	9	2	1
120	 You brought this on yourself.	9	2	1
121	 I've done nothing.	9	2	1
122	 Quite right, you did nothing	9	2	1
123	 when your son called for Ned Stark's head.	9	2	1
124	 Now the entire North has risen up against us.	9	2	1
125	 - I tried to stop it. - Did you? You failed.	9	2	1
126	 That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.	10	2	1
127	 - Robb Stark is a child. - Who's won every battle he's fought.	10	2	1
128	 Do you understand we're losing the war?	10	2	1
129	 - What do you know about warfare? - Nothing.	10	2	1
130	 But I know people.	10	2	1
131	 And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.	10	2	1
132	 - Joffrey is king. - Joffrey is king.	10	2	1
133	 You are here to advise him.	10	2	1
134	 I'm only here to advise him.	10	2	1
135	 And if the king listens to what I say,	10	2	1
136	 the king might just get his Uncle Jaime back.	10	2	1
137	 How?	10	2	1
138	 You love your children.	10	2	1
139	 It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones.	10	2	1
140	 The Starks love their children as well.	10	2	1
141	 - And we have two of them. - One.	10	2	1
142	 - One? - Arya, little animal, she disappeared.	11	2	1
143	 Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke?	11	2	1
144	 We had three Starks to trade.	11	2	1
145	 You chopped one's head off and let another escape.	11	2	1
146	 Father will be furious.	11	2	1
147	 It must be odd for you	11	2	1
148	 to be the disappointing child.	11	2	1
149	 LEADRANACH: My lord, may the old gods watch over your brother	11	2	1
150	 and all our Northern sons.	11	2	1
151	 The walls of my holdfast will not stand the winter.	11	2	1
152	 The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys,	11	2	1
153	 and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers.	11	2	1
154	 When I was a boy,	12	2	1
155	 I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhen's Square in a summer.	12	2	1
156	 Men worked back then.	12	2	1
157	 Today, my holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children.	12	2	1
158	 At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps.	12	2	1
159	 Gods forbid it rains.	12	2	1
160	 Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall.	12	2	1
161	 Maintenance of a holdfast generally falls to the lord of that holdfast.	12	2	1
162	 Generally, yes,	12	2	1
163	 but I've sent all the young men off to fight Robb Stark's war.	12	2	1
164	 King Robb. And it's not his war.	12	2	1
165	 He didn't choose it.	12	2	1
166	 Maybe not, my lord, but he called in his banners and took the men.	12	2	1
167	 Joffrey killed my father,	12	2	1
168	 your liege lord.	12	2	1
169	 Do you remember your vows, ser?	12	2	1
170	 Of course I remember!	12	2	1
171	 We can spare four masons for a week, my lord.	13	2	1
172	 Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?	13	2	1
173	 I believe it will.	13	2	1
174	 We didn't want him here all day, did we?	13	2	1
175	 I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.	13	2	1
176	 Nor did I.	13	2	1
177	 But listening to people you'd rather not listen to	13	2	1
178	 is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell.	13	2	1
179	 (BRAN SIGHS)	13	2	1

188	 Lucky for you.	14	2	1
189	 That way.	14	2	1
190	 You've been having those dreams again.	15	2	1
191	 BRAN: I don't dream.	15	2	1
192	 Everyone dreams.	15	2	1
193	 I don't.	15	2	1
194	 Heard some of the men talking about the comet.	15	2	1
195	 They say it's an omen.	15	2	1
196	 They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.	15	2	1
197	 Did they?	15	2	1
198	 I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red.	15	2	1
199	 Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long.	15	2	1
200	 Heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood	15	2	1
201	 to mark the death of your father.	15	2	1
202	 The stars don't fall for men.	15	2	1
203	 Red comet means one thing, boy.	15	2	1
204	 Dragons.	15	2	1
205	 The dragons are all dead.	15	2	1
206	 They've been dead for centuries.	15	2	1
207	 (SHRIEKS)	16	2	1
208	 Mmm.	16	2	1
209	 What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?	16	2	1
210	 He said they ate meat.	16	2	1
211	 He didn't tell you what kind of meat?	16	2	1
212	 My brother didn't know anything about dragons.	17	2	1
213	 He didn't know anything about anything.	17	2	1

218	 I remember.	17	2	1
219	 I promised to protect them.	17	2	1
220	 Promised them their enemies would die screaming.	17	2	1
221	 How do I make starvation scream?	17	2	1
222	 A trick I never learned, I'm afraid.	18	2	1
223	 Does it ever end?	18	2	1
224	 This is further east than I've ever been.	18	2	1
225	 But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the Red Waste.	18	2	1
226	 And you're sure there's no other way?	18	2	1
227	 If we go south to the land of the Lhazareen,	18	2	1
228	 the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons.	18	2	1
229	 If we go west to the Dothraki Sea,	18	2	1
230	 the first khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons.	18	2	1
231	 No one will take my dragons.	18	2	1
232	 They are too weak to fight,	18	2	1
233	 as are your people.	18	2	1

238	 You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast.	19	2	1
239	 What do we seek, Khaleesi?	19	2	1
240	 Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea.	19	2	1
241	 Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side.	19	2	1

253	 I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters.	21	2	1
254	 I was born in a place like this.	21	2	1
255	 Later, I fell on hard times.	21	2	1
256	 SAMWELL: Are those girls?	21	2	1
257	 DOLOROUS EDD: Craster's daughters.	21	2	1

259	 I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.	21	2	1
260	 What, he don't like people messing with his daughters?	21	2	1
261	 He don't like people messing with his wives.	21	2	1
262	 He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters.	22	2	1

269	 Hmm?	22	2	1
270	 He marries his daughters.	22	2	1
271	 What does he do with his sons?	22	2	1
272	 He said he planned to stop here on his way to the Frostfangs.	22	2	1

285	 Listen to me, bastard.	23	2	1
286	 All you lot from south of the Wall, you're Southerners.	23	2	1

306	 And now he's King-beyond-the-Wall.	24	2	1
307	 He's been calling himself that for years.	24	2	1

519	 Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya,	41	2	1
520	 we can't seem to locate her.	41	2	1

522	 And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.	42	2	1

524	 If we choose to negotiate with the Starks,	42	2	1

527	 Well, you could ask Varys where she is.	42	2	1
528	 He'll have an answer for you.	42	2	1
529	 Whether you believe it...	42	2	1
530	 Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs.	42	2	1
531	 Who knows what they want?	42	2	1
532	 A mockingbird.	42	2	1
533	 - You created your own sigil, didn't you? - Yes.	42	2	1
534	 Appropriate, for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.	42	2	1
535	 I'm glad you like it.	42	2	1
536	 Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family.	42	2	1
537	 Others have to find their own way.	42	2	1
538	 I heard a song once	42	2	1
539	 about a boy of modest means	42	2	1
540	 who found his way into the home of a very prominent family.	42	2	1
541	 He loved the eldest daughter.	43	2	1
542	 Sadly, she had eyes for another.	43	2	1
543	 When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise.	43	2	1
544	 Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections.	43	2	1
545	 And when those affections become common knowledge,	43	2	1
546	 well, that is an awkward situation indeed,	43	2	1
547	 especially in a prominent family.	43	2	1
548	 But prominent families often forget a simple truth,	43	2	1
549	 I've found.	43	2	1
550	 And which truth is that?	43	2	1
551	 Knowledge is power.	43	2	1
552	 Seize him.	43	2	1

555	 I've changed my mind. Let him go.	43	2	1

557	 Turn around.	44	2	1
558	 Close your eyes.	44	2	1

566	 First, your family must release my sisters.	44	2	1
567	 Second, my father's bones must be returned to us	44	2	1
568	 so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell.	45	2	1
569	 And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned.	45	2	1
570	 Their families can honor them with proper funerals.	45	2	1
571	 - An honorable request, Your Grace. - Third...	45	2	1
572	 Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North.	45	2	1
573	 From this time till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom.	45	2	1
574	 The King in the North.	45	2	1
575	 - King in the North. - King in the North.	45	2	1
576	 Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again.	45	2	1
577	 If he disregards this command,	45	2	1
578	 he shall suffer the same fate as my father,	45	2	1
579	 only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me.	45	2	1
580	 These are... Your Grace, these are...	45	2	1
581	 These are my terms.	45	2	1
582	 If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace.	45	2	1
583	 If not,	46	2	1
584	 I will litter the South with Lannister dead.	46	2	1
585	 King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace.	46	2	1
586	 Oh, is he?	46	2	1
587	 You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton.	46	2	1
588	 That will be all for tonight.	46	2	1
589	 A word, Your Grace?	46	2	1
590	" You don't have to call me ""Your Grace"" when no one's around."	46	2	1
591	 It's not so bad once you get used to it.	46	2	1
592	 I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.	46	2	1
593	 The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?	46	2	1
594	 Of course they are.	46	2	1
595	 We can fight them in the fields as long as you like,	46	2	1
596	 but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing.	47	2	1
597	 And we can't take King's Landing without ships.	47	2	1
598	 My father has ships and men who know how to sail them.	47	2	1
599	 Men who fought my father.	47	2	1
600	 Men who fought King Robert to free themselves	47	2	1
601	 from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now.	47	2	1
602	 I'm his only living son.	47	2	1
603	 He'll listen to me. I know he will.	47	2	1
604	 I'm not a Stark. I know that.	47	2	1
605	 But your father raised me to be an honorable man.	47	2	1
606	 We can avenge him together.	47	2	1
607	 You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.	47	2	1
608	 I need his ships. They say he has 200.	47	2	1
609	 They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing.	47	2	1
610	 Shall we rally them to fight for us?	47	2	1
611	 I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.	47	2	1
612	 I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy.	48	2	1
613	 Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.	48	2	1
614	 Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne.	48	2	1
615	 Before me, it was Father.	48	2	1
616	 You married one rebel and mothered another.	48	2	1
617	 I mothered more than just rebels,	48	2	1
618	 a fact you seem to have forgotten.	48	2	1
619	 If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet.	48	2	1
620	 You want to leave Sansa in the queen's hands?	48	2	1
621	 And Arya...	48	2	1
622	 I haven't heard a word about Arya. What are we fighting for, if not for them?	48	2	1
623	 It's more complicated than that! You know it is.	48	2	1
624	 It's time for me to go home.	49	2	1
625	 I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.	49	2	1
626	 You can't go to Winterfell.	49	2	1
627	 I beg your pardon?	49	2	1
628	 I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys	49	2	1
629	 because tomorrow you'll ride south to the Stormlands.	49	2	1
630	 Why in the name of all the gods...	49	2	1
631	 Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon.	49	2	1
632	 He's rallied an army of 100,000.	49	2	1
633	 You know him. You know his family.	49	2	1
634	 I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy.	49	2	1
635	 You have a hundred other lords...	49	2	1
636	 Which of these lords do I trust more than you?	49	2	1
637	 If Renly sides with us,	49	2	1
638	 we'll outnumber them two to one.	49	2	1
639	 When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace.	49	2	1
640	 We'll get the girls back.	49	2	1
641	 Then we'll all go home, for good.	49	2	1
642	 I will ride at first light.	50	2	1
643	 We will all be together again soon, I promise.	50	2	1
644	 You've done so well.	50	2	1
645	 Your father would be proud.	50	2	1
646	 - Give Lord Renly my regards. - King Renly.	50	2	1

651	 That is a seat for a conqueror.	51	2	1
652	 It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers.	51	2	1
653	 We can't find Arya Stark.	51	2	1
654	 With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere.	51	2	1
655	 Perhaps. But if not, we need her.	51	2	1
656	 They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone.	51	2	1
657	 I think they might. They're weak.	51	2	1
658	 They put too much value on their women.	51	2	1
659	 We need to set our armies to the task of finding her.	51	2	1
660	 Send out as many men as we can.	51	2	1
661	 I'm sure if you asked Grandfather...	51	2	1
662	 The king does not ask, he commands.	51	2	1

10	 Sansa Stark?	0	5	5
11	 I saw her riding on the East Road with Littlefinger. We'll follow them.	0	5	5
12	 - May I introduce my son, Ramsay Bolton. - My Lady.	0	5	5
13	 Welcome home, Lady Stark. The North remembers.	0	5	5
14	 You let a half-wit escape with a cripple,	0	5	5
15	 and Rickon too, the little one.	0	5	5
16	 I told you what would happen if you served me loyally.	0	5	5
17	 And what would happen if you did not.	1	5	5
18	 - Who are you? - Your captor.	1	5	5
19	 You said you're taking me to the queen.	1	5	5
20	 Queen Daenerys Targaryen.	1	5	5
21	 You're the Mother of Dragons. Show your strength.	1	5	5
22	 No one's seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know, he's flown halfway across the world.	1	5	5
23	 The Wise Masters ask for the reopening of the fighting pits.	1	5	5
24	 Where slaves fought slaves to the death?	1	5	5
25	 Opening them would show the people of Meereen that you respect their traditions.	1	5	5
26	 Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city together.	1	5	5

28	 I'm so sorry, my queen.	4	5	5
29	 He was a good man.	4	5	5
30	" ""Barristan the Bold"" they called him."	4	5	5
31	 He crossed a continent to serve me.	4	5	5
32	 He was a loyal friend.	4	5	5
33	 And he died in an alley,	4	5	5
34	 butchered by cowards who hide behind masks.	4	5	5
35	 We could pull back to the pyramid district,	4	5	5
36	 secure it, and use it as a base from which to operate.	5	5	5
37	 Then we clean the city out,	5	5	5
38	 neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street,	5	5	5
39	 until the rats have nowhere left to hide.	5	5	5
40	 I prefer your earlier suggestion.	5	5	5
41	 Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me.	5	5	5
42	 But I'm the leader of my family.	5	5	5
43	 No, Your Grace!	5	5	5
44	 I had nothing to do with this.	5	5	5
45	 Your Grace!	5	5	5

72	 Maester Aemon.	9	5	5
73	 Lord Commander.	9	5	5
74	 Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone.	9	5	5
75	 How are you feeling?	10	5	5
76	 Oh, like a hundred-year-old man	10	5	5
77	 slowly freezing to death.	10	5	5
78	 I need your advice.	10	5	5
79	 There's something I want to do, something I...	10	5	5
80	 have to do.	10	5	5
81	 But it'll divide the Night's Watch.	10	5	5
82	 Bitterly.	10	5	5
83	 Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order.	10	5	5
84	 Half the men hate you already, Lord Commander.	10	5	5
85	 Do it.	10	5	5
86	 But you don't know what it is.	10	5	5
87	 That doesn't matter.	10	5	5
88	 You do.	10	5	5
89	 You will find little joy in your command.	10	5	5
90	 But with luck,	10	5	5
91	 you will find the strength to do what needs to be done.	11	5	5
92	 Kill the boy, Jon Snow.	11	5	5
93	 Winter is almost upon us.	11	5	5
94	 Kill the boy	11	5	5
95	 and let the man be born.	11	5	5
96	 Where are the rest of the free folk now?	11	5	5
97	 Where have they gone?	11	5	5
98	 Who leads them?	11	5	5
99	 They followed Mance.	11	5	5
100	 They won't follow anyone else.	11	5	5
101	 What about you?	11	5	5
102	 Hard to lead when you're in chains.	11	5	5
103	 What if I unchained you?	12	5	5
104	 Why would you do that?	12	5	5
105	 Because you are not my enemy.	12	5	5
106	 And I'm not yours.	12	5	5
107	 You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends.	12	5	5
108	 For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath	12	5	5
109	 to be the shield that guards the realms of men.	12	5	5
110	 And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath.	12	5	5
111	 You belong to the realms of men.	12	5	5
112	 All of you.	12	5	5
113	 And now everything is going to change?	12	5	5
114	 - It is. - Why now?	12	5	5
115	 Because now I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.	12	5	5
116	 What would you have me do,	12	5	5
117	 Lord Commander?	12	5	5
118	 I'd have you go north of the Wall.	12	5	5
119	 Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here.	12	5	5
120	 I'll open the gates for them and let them through.	12	5	5
121	 I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.	12	5	5
122	 They won't kneel for you and neither will I.	12	5	5
123	 I don't want them to kneel for me.	13	5	5
124	 I want them to fight with me when the time comes.	13	5	5
125	 The day I ask my people to fight with the crows	13	5	5
126	 is the day my people cut my guts from my belly	13	5	5
127	 and make me eat them.	13	5	5
128	 And how many of your people can't fight?	13	5	5
129	 The women, the children, the old, the sick--	13	5	5
130	 what happens to them?	13	5	5
131	 You're condemning them to death.	13	5	5
132	 Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace.	13	5	5
133	 Or maybe you're not proud.	13	5	5
134	 Maybe you're just a coward.	13	5	5
135	 Easy thing to say to a man in chains.	13	5	5
136	 Your people need a leader.	14	5	5
137	 And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late.	14	5	5
138	 We don't have much time and they have less.	14	5	5
139	 The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first.	14	5	5
140	 I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin.	14	5	5
141	 Make peace to save your people.	14	5	5
142	 Most of them are at Hardhome.	14	5	5
143	 You know where that is?	14	5	5
144	 Up on Storrold's Point.	14	5	5
145	 I can give you 10 horses and nine other men.	14	5	5
146	 You can get there in a week.	14	5	5
147	 We'll need ships.	14	5	5
148	 I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.	14	5	5
149	 All right, then.	15	5	5
150	 You're coming with me.	15	5	5
151	 You're the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.	15	5	5
152	 They need to hear it from you.	15	5	5
153	 They need to know the ships they are boarding	15	5	5
154	 won't be torched in the middle of the sea.	15	5	5
155	 You come with me or I don't go.	15	5	5
156	 You'd bring wildlings here through our gates?	15	5	5
157	 Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing.	15	5	5
158	 Let them die. We got our own to worry about.	15	5	5
159	 Less enemies for us.	15	5	5
160	 Fewer.	15	5	5
161	 - What? - Nothing.	15	5	5
162	 Look, well, there is good farmland in the Gift.	15	5	5
163	 Land that no one uses now.	15	5	5
164	 A dozen abandoned villages.	15	5	5
165	 And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages?	16	5	5
166	 Because the wildlings raided them for years.	16	5	5
167	 Cut them down!	16	5	5
168	 Just like they did this boy's people.	16	5	5
169	 Aye!	16	5	5
170	 We've been fighting them for thousands of years.	16	5	5
171	 They've slaughtered villages.	16	5	5
172	 They've slaughtered our brothers.	16	5	5
173	 And we've slaughtered theirs.	16	5	5
174	 I will follow you anywhere, you know that.	16	5	5
175	 - But they killed Grenn. - Yes.	16	5	5
176	 - And they killed Pyp. - Aye.	16	5	5
177	 They killed 50 of our brothers.	16	5	5
178	 I can't forget that.	16	5	5
179	 I can't forgive it.	16	5	5
180	 You were at the Fist of the First Men.	16	5	5
181	 If we abandon them, you know what they become.	16	5	5
182	 We can learn to live with the wildlings	16	5	5
183	 or we can add them to the army of the dead.	16	5	5
184	 Whatever they are now, they're better than that.	16	5	5
185	 Thank you.	17	5	5
186	 Olly.	17	5	5
187	 If you have something you want to say to me,	17	5	5
188	 say it.	17	5	5
189	 It's all right.	17	5	5
190	 You don't mean it, do you?	17	5	5
191	 Telling the wildlings you want to make peace.	17	5	5
192	 You're just doing it to trick them.	17	5	5
193	 It's not a trick.	17	5	5
194	 They burned my village.	18	5	5
195	 They put an arrow through my father's head	18	5	5
196	 right in front of me.	18	5	5
197	 They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew.	18	5	5
198	 I know what it's like to lose the people you love.	18	5	5
199	 I know this is hard for you.	18	5	5
200	 But winter is coming.	18	5	5
201	 We know what's coming with it.	18	5	5
202	 We can't face it alone.	18	5	5
203	 Will there be anything else you need, Lord Commander?	18	5	5
204	 No.	18	5	5
205	 She's far away from the Lannisters.	19	5	5
206	 This is her home.	19	5	5
207	 Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.	19	5	5
208	 Better off with the Boltons	19	5	5
209	 who murdered her mother and brother?	19	5	5
210	 Sansa's in danger even if she doesn't realize it.	19	5	5
211	 Thank you.	20	5	5
212	 You've lived here a long time?	20	5	5
213	 Aye.	20	5	5
214	 Did you know Lord Eddard?	20	5	5
215	 I knew him	20	5	5
216	 and his father before him.	20	5	5
217	 The Starks are gone now.	20	5	5
218	 Not all of them.	20	5	5
219	 I know who's inside that castle.	20	5	5
220	 Everyone knows.	20	5	5
221	 The Boltons.	20	5	5
222	 I'm not talking about the Boltons.	20	5	5
223	 I need to get a message to her.	20	5	5
224	 To Sansa Stark.	20	5	5
225	 Who are you?	20	5	5
226	 Someone who swore to keep her safe.	20	5	5
227	 Swore to who?	20	5	5
228	 Her mother.	20	5	5
229	 Her mother's dead.	20	5	5
230	 That doesn't release me from an oath.	21	5	5
231	 I served Lady Catelyn.	21	5	5
232	 I serve her still.	21	5	5
233	 Who do you serve?	21	5	5
234	 Come back here.	21	5	5
235	 Myranda.	21	5	5
236	 I saw you staring at her.	21	5	5
237	 I'm going to marry her.	21	5	5
238	 That will involve looking at her from time to time.	21	5	5
239	 You said you'd marry me.	21	5	5
240	 And I meant it.	21	5	5
241	 When I was a bastard named Snow.	21	5	5
242	 But I'm a Bolton now.	21	5	5
243	 What I want is no longer the primary consideration.	21	5	5
244	 I'm furthering a dynasty.	21	5	5
245	 Do you think she's pretty?	22	5	5
246	 Of course I do.	22	5	5
247	 I'm not blind.	22	5	5
248	 You think she's pretty, too.	22	5	5
249	 I'm looking forward to our wedding night.	22	5	5
250	 But don't worry, I'll have plenty of time for you.	22	5	5
251	 Perhaps I'll marry, too.	22	5	5
252	 You're the kennel master's daughter.	22	5	5
253	 Who are you going to marry, the stable keeper's son?	22	5	5
254	 You're mine.	22	5	5
255	 You're not going anywhere.	22	5	5
256	 Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy.	22	5	5
257	 Jealousy bores me. You remember what happens to people who bore me.	23	5	5
258	 You're not going to bore me, are you, Myranda?	23	5	5
259	 Never.	23	5	5
260	 Beg pardon, my lady.	24	5	5
261	 I've come to refill the wash basin.	24	5	5
262	 Oh, I don't need--	24	5	5
263	 You still have friends in the North.	24	5	5
264	 If you're ever in trouble,	24	5	5
265	 light a candle in the highest window of the broken tower.	24	5	5
266	 - But who-- - You're not alone.	24	5	5
267	 I like your dress.	25	5	5
268	 Who made it for you?	25	5	5
269	 I made it myself.	25	5	5
270	 Really?	25	5	5
271	 Who-- who are you?	25	5	5
272	 I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter.	25	5	5
273	 May I?	25	5	5
274	 Oh, wonderful.	25	5	5
275	 The stitching.	25	5	5
276	 - Who taught you? - My mother.	25	5	5
277	 I'm sorry for what happened to her.	25	5	5
278	 Thank you.	25	5	5
279	 It's good that she taught you.	25	5	5
280	 It was a gift.	25	5	5
281	 Now every time you wear something you made,	25	5	5
282	 you can remember her.	25	5	5
283	 I'd rather have a mother.	25	5	5
284	 I know. It's not the same.	25	5	5
285	 Still, it's good to remember.	26	5	5
286	 Remember the way things were.	26	5	5
287	 I almost forgot.	26	5	5
288	 There's something else	26	5	5
289	 to help you remember.	26	5	5
290	 Down there at the end.	26	5	5
291	 What is it?	26	5	5
292	 That would spoil the surprise.	26	5	5
293	 Go ahead, it's perfectly safe.	26	5	5
294	 You won't believe it when you see it.	26	5	5
295	 Theon?	27	5	5
296	 You shouldn't be here.	28	5	5
297	 You smell particularly ripe this evening.	28	5	5
298	 Pour me some wine.	28	5	5
299	 Do you have something to tell me?	28	5	5
300	 No, my lord.	29	5	5
301	 Reek.	29	5	5
302	 She saw me.	29	5	5
303	 Who?	29	5	5
304	 Sansa. Lady Sansa.	29	5	5
305	 She came to the kennels.	29	5	5
306	 She saw you?	29	5	5
307	 Yes. I'm sorry, master.	29	5	5
308	 Forgive me. I didn't think--	29	5	5
309	 Come here.	29	5	5
310	 You mustn't keep secrets from me, Reek.	29	5	5
311	 Get on your knees.	29	5	5
312	 Give me your hand.	29	5	5
313	 I forgive you.	30	5	5
314	 I trust you find your chamber suitable, my lady.	30	5	5
315	 Yes, thank you, my lord.	30	5	5
316	 Allow me.	30	5	5
317	 Mother.	30	5	5
318	 Thank you, Ramsay.	30	5	5
319	 My lady, we are all a family, we northerners.	30	5	5
320	 Our blood ties go back thousands of years.	31	5	5
321	 So I'd like to drink to our wedding.	31	5	5
322	 May our happiness spread from Moat Cailin	31	5	5
323	 to the Last Hearth.	31	5	5
324	 To your wedding.	31	5	5
325	 To your wedding.	31	5	5
326	 It must be difficult for you being in a strange place.	31	5	5
327	 This isn't a strange place. This is my home.	31	5	5
328	 It's the people who are strange.	31	5	5
329	 You're right.	31	5	5
330	 Very strange.	31	5	5
331	 More wine, please.	31	5	5
332	 I heard you two had reunited.	31	5	5
333	 A fitting place for it.	31	5	5
334	 I like to imagine that the last time you spoke	32	5	5
335	 was in this very room.	32	5	5
336	 Are you still angry with him	32	5	5
337	 after he...	32	5	5
338	 what he did?	32	5	5
339	 Don't worry.	32	5	5
340	 The North remembers.	32	5	5
341	 I punished him for it.	32	5	5
342	 He's not ironborn anymore.	32	5	5
343	 Not Theon Greyjoy anymore.	32	5	5
344	 He's a new man.	32	5	5
345	 A new person, anyway.	32	5	5
346	 Aren't you, Reek?	32	5	5
347	 Yes, master.	32	5	5
348	 That's his new name-- Reek.	32	5	5
349	 Why are you doing this?	32	5	5
350	 Because Reek has something to say to you.	32	5	5
351	 Don't you, Reek?	32	5	5
352	 An apology.	33	5	5
353	 Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did.	33	5	5
354	 Apologize for murdering her two brothers.	33	5	5
355	 I'm sorry.	33	5	5
356	 Look at her, Reek.	33	5	5
357	 An apology doesn't mean anything	33	5	5
358	 if you're not looking the person in the eye.	33	5	5
359	 - I'm sorry. - Sorry about what?	33	5	5
360	 For killing your brothers.	33	5	5
361	 There, over and done with.	34	5	5
362	 Doesn't everyone feel better? I do.	34	5	5
363	 That was getting very tense.	34	5	5
364	 Whew.	34	5	5
365	 You know what, my lady?	34	5	5
366	 What with him having murdered your brothers	34	5	5
367	 and the rest of your family gone...	34	5	5
368	 Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin	34	5	5
369	 that you have left.	34	5	5
370	 Reek.	34	5	5
371	 You will give away the bride.	34	5	5
372	 Someone has to. What better person?	34	5	5
373	 Good? Good?	34	5	5
374	 Yes, yes, very good.	34	5	5
375	 Wonderful.	34	5	5
376	 Walda and I have some good news as well,	35	5	5
377	 since we're all together.	35	5	5
378	 We're going to have a baby.	35	5	5
379	 I'm very happy for you.	35	5	5
380	 From the way she's carrying,	35	5	5
381	 Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy.	35	5	5
382	 How can you be sure?	35	5	5
383	 Sure of what?	35	5	5
384	 That she's pregnant.	35	5	5
385	 I mean...	35	5	5
386	 how can you tell?	35	5	5
387	 Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt.	35	5	5
388	 So how did you manage it?	36	5	5
389	 Manage what?	36	5	5
390	 Getting her pregnant.	36	5	5
391	 I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.	36	5	5
392	 Of course, but how did you...	36	5	5
393	 find it?	36	5	5
394	 You disgraced yourself at dinner	36	5	5
395	 parading that creature before the Stark girl.	36	5	5
396	 And if it's a boy?	36	5	5
397	 You're worried about your position.	36	5	5
398	 My position is quite clear.	36	5	5
399	 I'm your son	36	5	5
400	 until a better alternative comes along.	36	5	5
401	 You've never asked me about your mother.	36	5	5
402	 Why would I?	36	5	5
403	 She had me, she died.	36	5	5
404	 And here we are.	37	5	5
405	 She was a peasant girl.	37	5	5
406	 Pretty in a common sort of way.	37	5	5
407	 She was the miller's wife.	37	5	5
408	 Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent.	37	5	5
409	 So I had him hanged	37	5	5
410	 and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying.	37	5	5
411	 She fought me the whole time.	37	5	5
412	 She was lucky I didn't hang her, too.	37	5	5
413	 A year later she came to my gates	37	5	5
414	 with a squalling baby in her arms.	37	5	5
415	 A baby she claimed was mine.	37	5	5
416	 I nearly had her whipped	37	5	5
417	 and the child thrown in the river.	37	5	5
418	 But then I looked at you	37	5	5
419	 and I saw then what I see now.	37	5	5
420	 You are my son.	37	5	5
421	 Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black.	38	5	5
422	 But he won't stay for long.	38	5	5
423	 He wants the Iron Throne,	38	5	5
424	 and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell.	38	5	5
425	 He means to take the North.	38	5	5
426	 But the North is ours.	38	5	5
427	 It's yours and mine.	38	5	5
428	 Will you help me defeat him?	38	5	5
429	 Yes.	38	5	5
430	 Is this every book there is?	38	5	5
431	 Every book there is?	38	5	5
432	 - In the world. - Well, no.	38	5	5
433	 There are thousands and thousands of books out there.	38	5	5
434	 This library is rather small, actually.	38	5	5
435	 Where you grew up, were there more books?	39	5	5
436	 My father's not the most literate man.	39	5	5
437	 They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.	39	5	5
438	 Where's that?	39	5	5
439	 The Citadel?	39	5	5
440	 In Oldtown.	39	5	5
441	 I'm sorry I don't know things.	39	5	5
442	 Gilly, look at me.	39	5	5
443	 You know how to do a hundred things I can never do.	39	5	5
444	 You can build a fire with wet wood.	39	5	5
445	 You can cook. You can stitch a wound.	39	5	5
446	 I can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor.	39	5	5
447	 - Well... - Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?	39	5	5
448	 It's where they train the maesters.	39	5	5
449	 Like Maester Aemon?	39	5	5
450	 I wanted to be one when I was young.	39	5	5
451	 Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch.	39	5	5
452	 Far more adventure up here anyway.	40	5	5
453	 I wouldn't have met you.	40	5	5
454	 Ah, Your Grace.	40	5	5
455	 You're Samwell Tarly?	40	5	5
456	 I am, Your Grace.	40	5	5
457	 Your father is Randyll Tarly.	40	5	5
458	 He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford.	40	5	5
459	 Only battle Robert ever lost.	40	5	5
460	 I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon, but he never listened.	40	5	5
461	 Fine soldier, your father.	40	5	5
462	 You don't look like a soldier.	40	5	5
463	 But I'm told you killed a white walker.	40	5	5
464	 I did, Your Grace.	41	5	5
465	 How?	41	5	5
466	 With a dagger made of dragonglass.	41	5	5
467	 Dragonglass?	41	5	5
468	 What the maesters call obsidian.	41	5	5
469	 I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone.	41	5	5
470	 Why would obsidian kill a walker?	41	5	5
471	 I don't know.	41	5	5
472	 I've been going through all the old manuscripts	41	5	5
473	 hoping to find something, and all I've learned	41	5	5
474	 is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass.	41	5	5
475	 The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.	41	5	5
476	 I've seen it, Your Grace.	41	5	5
477	 Seen what?	41	5	5
478	 The army of the dead.	41	5	5
479	 - And when they come-- - We have to know how to fight them.	41	5	5
480	 Keep reading, Samwell Tarly.	41	5	5
481	 It's time.	42	5	5
482	 Uh, Your Grace.	42	5	5
483	 Wouldn't it be better to wait?	42	5	5
484	 When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men.	42	5	5
485	 If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings.	42	5	5
486	 We can't wait that long.	42	5	5
487	 We have the advantage-- more men, more horses, all fed and rested.	42	5	5
488	 But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor.	42	5	5
489	 This could turn to winter at any moment.	42	5	5
490	 We have to act now. Give the order.	42	5	5
491	 We march at sunrise.	42	5	5
492	 I'll choose a dozen men to stay	42	5	5
493	 and guard the queen and the princess.	42	5	5
494	 No need. They're coming with us.	42	5	5
495	 It's a tough road ahead, Your Grace.	42	5	5
496	 - Won't they be safer-- - Here?	42	5	5
497	 Half these watchmen are killers and rapists.	42	5	5
498	 No, they march with us.	42	5	5
499	 As you wish, Your Grace.	42	5	5
500	 Do you think Father will let me go down into the crypt?	43	5	5
501	 Beg your pardon?	43	5	5
502	 At Winterfell.	43	5	5
503	 All the Kings in the North are buried there.	43	5	5
504	 Bran the Builder and King Dorren and--	43	5	5
505	 First things first. It's a long march ahead.	43	5	5
506	 And then we have to take the castle.	43	5	5
507	 Is there going to be a battle?	43	5	5
508	 Aye, princess, but you won't be anywhere near--	43	5	5
509	 That's enough talk of battle, Ser Davos.	43	5	5
510	 You'll scare the child.	43	5	5
511	 Yes, my queen.	43	5	5
512	 - I'm not scared. - Well, I am.	43	5	5
513	 When the battle comes, promise you'll protect me.	43	5	5
514	 I promise.	44	5	5
515	 I hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings.	44	5	5
516	 I need those ships.	44	5	5
517	 You'll get them back, I swear it.	44	5	5
518	 Have a safe journey, Your Grace.	44	5	5
519	 And thank you.	44	5	5
520	 Mount up!	45	5	5
521	 Colors!	45	5	5
522	 No.	46	5	5
523	 You're still too weak.	46	5	5
524	 _	46	5	5
525	 _	46	5	5
526	 Ser Barristan?	46	5	5
527	 _	46	5	5
528	 _	46	5	5
529	 _	46	5	5
530	 _	46	5	5
531	 _	46	5	5
532	 _	46	5	5
533	 Are you ashamed?	46	5	5
534	 You were ambushed, outnumbered.	46	5	5
535	 There was no way you could have known.	46	5	5
536	 This is not why.	47	5	5
537	 Wounded in war,	47	5	5
538	 there is no shame for this.	47	5	5
539	 I am ashamed	47	5	5
540	 because when the knife go in	47	5	5
541	 and I fall to the ground,	47	5	5
542	 I am afraid.	47	5	5
543	 All men fear death.	47	5	5
544	 No, not death.	47	5	5
545	 I fear	47	5	5
546	 I never again see Missandei from the Island of Naath.	47	5	5
547	 Now you have given the Masters what they deserve.	48	5	5
548	 If I give everyone what they deserve,	48	5	5
549	 I'll have no one left to rule.	48	5	5
550	 Ser Barristan counseled mercy	48	5	5
551	 when I took this city right up to the morning he died.	48	5	5
552	 Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters	48	5	5
553	 and let the rest of the city fend for itself.	48	5	5
554	 What do you think?	48	5	5
555	 Your Grace, I think that I am not fit	48	5	5
556	 to have an opinion on these matters.	48	5	5
557	 You are as fit as anyone I know.	48	5	5
558	 You know why I'm here.	48	5	5
559	 And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart.	48	5	5
560	 So what do you think?	48	5	5
561	 I can only tell you what I have seen, Your Grace.	49	5	5
562	 I have seen you listen to your counselors.	49	5	5
563	 I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking	49	5	5
564	 and weigh the choices they put before you.	49	5	5
565	 And I have seen you ignore your counselors...	49	5	5
566	 because there was a better choice.	49	5	5
567	 One that only you could see.	49	5	5
568	 My-- my queen, please do not do this.	49	5	5
569	" What about ""valar morghulis""?"	49	5	5
570	 I did not want to die a coward.	49	5	5
571	 Apparently I do not want to die at all.	50	5	5
572	 It takes courage to admit fear.	50	5	5
573	 And to admit a mistake.	50	5	5
574	 I came here to tell you that I was wrong.	50	5	5
575	 I was wrong and you were right.	50	5	5
576	 About tradition.	50	5	5
577	 About bringing the people of this city together.	50	5	5
578	 I will reopen the fighting pits.	50	5	5
579	 To free men only.	50	5	5
580	 Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live.	50	5	5
581	 Yes, my queen.	50	5	5
582	 And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people,	50	5	5
583	 I will marry the leader of an ancient family.	50	5	5
584	 Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees.	50	5	5
585	 Don't worry.	51	5	5
586	 I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think.	51	5	5
587	 Where are we now?	51	5	5
588	 Not the Rhoyne.	51	5	5
589	 Long, sullen silences	51	5	5
590	 and an occasional punch in the face.	51	5	5
591	 The Mormont way.	51	5	5
592	 Let's start over.	52	5	5
593	 I apologize for before.	52	5	5
594	 My mouth sometimes runs away from me.	52	5	5
595	 This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip.	52	5	5
596	 We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen.	52	5	5
597	 We are.	52	5	5
598	 What would make our time together truly enjoyable	52	5	5
599	 would be some wine.	52	5	5
600	 No wine.	52	5	5
601	 I am a person who drinks.	52	5	5
602	 People who drink need to keep drinking.	52	5	5
603	 Otherwise, they're not...	52	5	5
604	 I know where we are.	52	5	5
605	 You're taking us through Valyria.	52	5	5
606	 I am.	53	5	5
607	 Have you sailed this route before?	53	5	5
608	 No.	53	5	5
609	 You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir	53	5	5
610	 from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?	53	5	5
611	 I think you'll be plenty.	53	5	5
612	 You know what they say.	53	5	5
613	 The Doom still rules Valyria.	53	5	5
614	 What about the demons and the flames?	53	5	5
615	 Aren't you afraid of the Doom?	53	5	5
616	 No.	53	5	5
617	 But pirates are.	53	5	5
618	 Oh.	53	5	5
619	 The Smoking Sea.	53	5	5
620	 How many centuries before we learn	53	5	5
621	 how to build cities like this again?	53	5	5
622	 Thousands of years the Valyrians were	53	5	5
623	 the best in the world at almost everything.	53	5	5
624	 And then...	53	5	5
625	 And then they weren't.	53	5	5
626	 And then they weren't.	53	5	5
627	" ""They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end."	54	5	5
628	 The hills that split asunder	54	5	5
629	 and the black that ate the skies;	54	5	5
630	 The flames that shot so high and hot	54	5	5
631	 that even dragons burned;	54	5	5
632	 Would never be the final sights	54	5	5
633	 that fell upon their eyes.	54	5	5
634	 A fly upon a wall,	54	5	5
635	" the waves the sea wind whipped and churned--"""	54	5	5
636	" ""The city of a thousand years,"	54	5	5
637	 and all that men had learned;	54	5	5
638	 The Doom consumed it all alike,	54	5	5
639	" and neither of them turned."""	54	5	5
640	 I would clap.	54	5	5
641	 I suppose this is it, then.	54	5	5
642	 This is what remains.	54	5	5
643	 What was that?	55	5	5
644	 Stone Men!	55	5	5
645	 Don't let them touch you!	55	5	5
646	 Get behind!	56	5	5
647	 Mormont, cut me free!	56	5	5
648	 Mormont!	56	5	5
649	 Mormont!	56	5	5
650	 Mormont!	56	5	5
651	 Tyrion?	57	5	5
652	 Tyrion.	57	5	5
653	 Tyrion.	57	5	5
654	 Tyrion.	57	5	5
655	 You're all right.	57	5	5
656	 You're heavier than you look.	57	5	5
657	 Did any of them touch you?	57	5	5
658	 You?	57	5	5
659	 I've seen greyscale before,	58	5	5
660	 but nothing like that.	58	5	5
661	 I suppose that's why they send them there.	58	5	5
662	 It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it.	58	5	5
663	 Thank you for saving me.	58	5	5
664	 Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving	58	5	5
665	 if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place.	58	5	5
666	 So what now?	58	5	5
667	 We walk up the coast.	58	5	5
668	 With luck, we'll find a fishing village.	58	5	5
669	 Maybe another boat.	58	5	5
670	 Without luck?	58	5	5
671	 We've got a long walk ahead of us.	58	5	5
672	 I'll get some wood for a fire.	58	5	5
673	 Try to get some rest, huh?	58	5	5
674	 That's the best idea you've had all day.	58	5	5

63	 - There was a boy. - I don't want to hear about it.	5	3	2

65	 We don't need to pour black magic on top of them.	5	3	2

76	 I only know the Wall is a long way off.	6	3	2
77	 My mother always told me	6	3	2
78	 you Westerosi were a grim lot.	6	3	2
79	 Grim, bearded,	6	3	2
80	 stinking barbarians	6	3	2
81	 that would row across the Narrow Sea	6	3	2
82	 and steal us from our beds.	6	3	2
83	 Did you ever think you'd marry one?	6	3	2
84	 I never thought I'd marry anyone at all.	6	3	2

98	 until we return.	7	3	2
99	 Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?	7	3	2
100	 Something else?	7	3	2
101	 By the time Bolton's bastard got to Winterfell,	7	3	2
102	 the ironborn were gone.	7	3	2
103	 They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch.	7	3	2
104	 And Bran and Rickon have not been found.	8	3	2
105	 They may have escaped.	8	3	2
106	 Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages.	8	3	2
107	 Have you received any demands?	8	3	2
108	 .	8	3	2
109	 Have you heard anything from Theon at all?	8	3	2
110	 ( gasps )	8	3	2
111	 ( shivering )	8	3	2
112	 Where am I?	8	3	2
113	 Who are you?	8	3	2
114	 What do you want?	9	3	2
115	 I want to do this.	9	3	2
116	 ( screaming )	9	3	2
117	 Do you know how long it's going to take us	9	3	2
118	 to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests?	9	3	2
119	 Yes.	9	3	2
120	 ( sheep bleating )	9	3	2
121	 So how shall we pass the time?	9	3	2
122	 By putting one foot in front of the other.	9	3	2
123	 It's going to be a very dull walk.	9	3	2
124	 I'm here to take you to King's Landing	9	3	2
125	 and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange.	9	3	2
126	 Dull is fine.	9	3	2
127	 You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are,	9	3	2
128	 no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute.	9	3	2
129	 Trust me on this.	9	3	2
130	 People have been serving me since I was born.	9	3	2
131	 You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank	9	3	2
132	 following her around for the rest of her life?	9	3	2
133	 A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword.	9	3	2
134	 If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service,	9	3	2
135	 I'm sure she'll let me know.	9	3	2
136	 She's an honest woman.	9	3	2
137	 All the good it's done her.	10	3	2
138	 ( moans )	10	3	2
139	 How did you come into Lady Stark's service?	10	3	2
140	 There's something we can talk about.	10	3	2
141	 Not your concern, Kingslayer.	10	3	2
142	 It had to be recently.	10	3	2
143	 You weren't with her at Winterfell.	10	3	2
144	 How would you know?	10	3	2
145	 Because I visited Winterfell.	10	3	2
146	 I would have noticed your dour head	10	3	2
147	 smacking into the archways.	10	3	2
148	 Move.	10	3	2
149	 - Were you pledged to Stannis? - Gods, no.	10	3	2
150	 Ah, Renly.	10	3	2
151	 Really?	10	3	2
152	 He wasn't fit to rule over anything	10	3	2
153	 more important than a 12-course meal.	10	3	2
154	 - Shut your mouth. - Why?	10	3	2
155	 I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget.	10	3	2
156	 Could hardly escape the little tulip.	10	3	2
157	 Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks.	10	3	2
158	 I knew him far better than you.	10	3	2
159	 I knew him as well as anyone.	10	3	2
160	 As a member of his Kingsguard,	10	3	2
161	 he trusted me with everything.	11	3	2
162	 He would have been a wonderful king.	11	3	2
163	 Sounds like you quite fancied him.	11	3	2
164	 I did not fancy him.	11	3	2
165	 Oh, gods, you did.	11	3	2
166	 Did you ever tell him?	11	3	2
167	 No, of course not.	11	3	2
168	 You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid.	11	3	2
169	 He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell.	11	3	2
170	 You're far too much man for him.	11	3	2
171	 I'm not interested in foul rumors.	11	3	2
172	 Unless they're about me.	11	3	2
173	 It's all true about Renly.	11	3	2
174	 His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court.	11	3	2
175	 It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks.	11	3	2
176	 - They'd have never got him off it. - Shut your mouth!	11	3	2
177	 I don't blame him.	11	3	2
178	 And I don't blame you, either.	11	3	2
179	 We don't get to choose who we love.	11	3	2
180	 ( horse snorts )	11	3	2
181	 - Where are you headed, then? -  South.	12	3	2
182	 - You? - Riverrun.	12	3	2
183	 Staying off the kingsroad, are you?	12	3	2
184	 They get you no matter where you go.	12	3	2
185	 - You can't win. - No, you really can't.	12	3	2
186	 Looks like you're safe enough, though.	12	3	2
187	 Meaning no offense, my lady, but...	12	3	2
188	 ( laughs ) I wouldn't tangle with you.	12	3	2
189	 ( laughs )	12	3	2
190	 - Seven blessings to you. - And you.	12	3	2
191	  He knows who I am.	12	3	2
192	 - He doesn't. - Maybe you're right.	12	3	2
193	 But what if you're not? What if he tells someone?	12	3	2
194	 We're not doing it.	12	3	2
195	 He's an innocent man.	12	3	2
196	 More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?	12	3	2
197	 Make it tighter here.	13	3	2
198	 That's better.	13	3	2
199	 It makes you look very strong.	13	3	2
200	 No flowers.	13	3	2
201	 I said no flowers.	13	3	2
202	 All these are wrong. Bring others.	13	3	2
203	 Yes, Your Grace.	13	3	2
204	 Bloody flowers.	13	3	2
205	 On the king.	13	3	2
206	 Looks like a Tyrell rose.	13	3	2
207	 Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown.	13	3	2
208	 Should be more than enough fabric.	13	3	2
209	 Tell me what you think of her.	13	3	2
210	 Who?	13	3	2
211	 Margaery.	13	3	2
212	 She's an ideal match.	13	3	2
213	 With the Tyrells beside us,	13	3	2
214	 we'll crush the Northerners.	13	3	2
215	 Hang their lords, burn their strongholds,	13	3	2
216	 sow their fields with salt,	13	3	2
217	 and no one will think of rebelling for another century.	13	3	2
218	 It is a good match, but what do you think of her?	14	3	2
219	 She's beautiful and intelligent.	14	3	2
220	 Yes, she is.	14	3	2
221	 Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting.	14	3	2
222	 Not to me.	14	3	2
223	 ( chuckles )	14	3	2
224	 I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself--	14	3	2
225	 This is becoming one of the most boring	14	3	2
226	 conversations I've ever had.	14	3	2
227	 Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason.	14	3	2
228	 She dresses like a harlot for a reason.	14	3	2
229	 She married a traitor and known degenerate	14	3	2
230	 like Renly Baratheon for a reason.	14	3	2
231	 She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to.	14	3	2
232	 That's what intelligent women do--	14	3	2
233	 what they're told.	14	3	2
234	 - You need to ask yourself-- - I don't need to do anything.	14	3	2
235	 ( sighs )	15	3	2
236	 Better.	15	3	2
237	 Much better.	15	3	2
238	 I still don't believe it.	15	3	2
239	 He didn't. He didn't want anything.	15	3	2
240	 He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.	15	3	2
241	 Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.	15	3	2
242	 Littlefinger's not in love with me.	15	3	2
243	 Love is not the thing he wants.	15	3	2
244	 He's too old.	15	3	2
245	 They never see it that way.	15	3	2
246	 He didn't ask you to do something for him?	15	3	2
247	 Spy on someone or...?	15	3	2
248	 No.	15	3	2
249	 If he does ask you for anything	16	3	2
250	 or try anything	16	3	2
251	 or touch you, I want you to tell me.	16	3	2
252	 Why? What will you do?	16	3	2
253	 I will make him stop.	16	3	2
254	 ( knocks )	16	3	2
255	  Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady.	16	3	2
256	 Send him in.	16	3	2
257	 Lady Sansa.	16	3	2
258	 Ser Loras.	16	3	2
259	 My sister Margaery invites you to take	16	3	2
260	 the air with her and our grandmother	16	3	2
261	 the Lady Olenna in the gardens.	16	3	2
262	 May I escort you to them?	16	3	2
263	 I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa.	16	3	2
264	 You are too kind, Ser Loras.	16	3	2
265	 You probably don't remember the first time we met.	16	3	2
266	 At the Hand's tourney, you gave me your favor.	17	3	2
267	 A rose, a red rose.	17	3	2
268	 Of course I did.	17	3	2
269	  It's more your color.	17	3	2
270	 - You take it. - Thank you.	17	3	2
271	 You're such a dear.	17	3	2
272	 I'll take my leave.	17	3	2
273	 Lady Sansa.	17	3	2
274	 Thank you, Ser Loras.	17	3	2
275	 Come.	17	3	2
276	 Lady Sansa, it is my honor	17	3	2
277	 to present my grandmother...	17	3	2
278	 the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell.	17	3	2
279	 Kiss me, child.	17	3	2
280	 It's so good of you to visit me	17	3	2
281	 and my foolish flock of hens.	17	3	2
282	 We're very sorry for your losses.	17	3	2
283	 And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery.	17	3	2
284	 - He was very gallant. - Gallant, yes.	17	3	2
285	 And charming and very clean.	18	3	2
286	 He knew how to dress and smile	18	3	2
287	 and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king.	18	3	2
288	 Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother.	18	3	2
289	 Father liked him and so did Loras.	18	3	2
290	 Loras is young and very good	18	3	2
291	 at knocking men off horses with a stick.	18	3	2
292	 That does not make him wise.	18	3	2
293	 As to your fathead father--	18	3	2
294	 Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?	18	3	2
295	 She might think we have some wits about us.	18	3	2
296	 One of us, at any rate.	18	3	2
297	 It was treason. I warned them.	18	3	2
298	 Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother.	18	3	2
299	 How could he possibly have any claim	18	3	2
300	 to that ugly iron chair?	18	3	2
301	 We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me.	18	3	2
302	 But once the cow's been milked,	18	3	2
303	 there's no squirting the cream back up her udders.	18	3	2
304	 So here we are to see things through.	18	3	2
305	 What do you say to that, Sansa?	18	3	2
306	 Shall we have some lemon cakes?	18	3	2
307	 Lemon cake's my favorite.	18	3	2
308	 So we've been told.	18	3	2
309	 Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death?	18	3	2
310	 Here, Sansa,	19	3	2
311	 come sit with me.	19	3	2
312	 I'm much less boring than these others.	19	3	2
313	 Do you know my son?	19	3	2
314	 The Lord of Highgarden?	19	3	2
315	 I haven't had the pleasure.	19	3	2
316	 No great pleasure, believe me.	19	3	2
317	 A ponderous oaf.	19	3	2
318	 His father was an oaf as well.	19	3	2
319	 My husband, the late Lord Luthor.	19	3	2
320	 He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking.	19	3	2
321	 They say he was looking up at the sky	19	3	2
322	 and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him.	19	3	2
323	 And now my son is doing the same,	19	3	2
324	 only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse.	19	3	2
325	 Now...	19	3	2
326	 I want you to tell me the truth	19	3	2
327	 about this royal boy, this Joffrey.	19	3	2
328	 I... I...	19	3	2
329	 You, you.	19	3	2
330	 Who else would know better?	19	3	2
331	 We've heard some troubling tales.	20	3	2
332	 Is there any truth to them?	20	3	2
333	 Has this boy mistreated you?	20	3	2
334	 Has he ripped out your tongue?	20	3	2
335	 Joff-- King Joffrey,	20	3	2
336	 he-- His Grace is very fair	20	3	2
337	 and handsome and as brave as a lion.	20	3	2
338	 Yes, all Lannisters are lions.	20	3	2
339	 And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose.	20	3	2
340	 But how kind is he? How clever?	20	3	2
341	 Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?	20	3	2
342	 I'm to be his wife.	20	3	2
343	 I only want to know what that means.	20	3	2
344	 ( footsteps approaching )	20	3	2
345	 Bring me some cheese.	20	3	2
346	 The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady.	20	3	2
347	 The cheese will be served when I want it served.	20	3	2
348	 And I want it served now.	20	3	2
349	 Are you frightened, child?	20	3	2
350	 No need for that.	21	3	2
351	 We're only women here.	21	3	2
352	 Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you.	21	3	2
353	 My father always told the truth.	21	3	2
354	 Yes, he had that reputation.	21	3	2
355	 And they named him traitor and took his head.	21	3	2
356	 Joffrey.	21	3	2
357	 Joffrey did that.	21	3	2
358	 He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off.	21	3	2
359	 And he said that was mercy.	21	3	2
360	 Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.	21	3	2
361	 Go on.	21	3	2
362	 I-- I can't. I never meant--	21	3	2
363	 my father was a traitor.	21	3	2
364	 My brother as well. I have traitor's blood.	21	3	2
365	 Please don't make me say anymore.	21	3	2
366	 She's terrified, Grandmother.	21	3	2
367	 - Just look at her. - Speak freely, child.	21	3	2
368	 We would never betray your confidence, I swear it.	21	3	2
369	 He's a monster.	22	3	2
370	 Ah.	22	3	2
371	 That's a pity.	22	3	2
372	 Please, don't stop the wedding.	22	3	2
373	 Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden	22	3	2
374	 is determined that Margaery shall be queen.	22	3	2
375	 Even so, we thank you for the truth.	22	3	2
376	 Ah, here comes my cheese.	22	3	2
377	 ( panting )	22	3	2
378	  We're at war.	22	3	2
379	 This march is a distraction.	22	3	2
380	 My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.	22	3	2
381	 - Are we riding to battle at Riverrun? - No.	22	3	2
382	 Then it's a distraction.	22	3	2
383	 My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there.	22	3	2
384	 We need his men.	22	3	2
385	 Unless he's been breeding them,	22	3	2
386	 he don't have enough to make a difference.	23	3	2
387	 Have you lost faith in our cause?	23	3	2
388	 If it's revenge, I still got faith in it.	23	3	2
389	 If you no longer believe--	23	3	2
390	 I can believe till it snows in Dorne.	23	3	2
391	 Don't change the fact that we've got half the men.	23	3	2
392	 You don't think we can win?	23	3	2
393	 May I speak my mind, Your Grace?	23	3	2
394	 Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?	23	3	2
395	 I think you lost this war	23	3	2
396	 the day you married her.	23	3	2
397	 ( horse whinnies )	23	3	2
398	 Whoa, whoa.	23	3	2
399	 Your Grace.	23	3	2
400	 You're afraid of her.	23	3	2
401	 - And she knows it. - I'm not afraid of her.	23	3	2
402	 ( snorting )	23	3	2
403	 May I help you, Lady Stark?	24	3	2
404	 No.	24	3	2
405	 I'm sorry, I shouldn't have--	24	3	2
406	 You can't help because a mother	24	3	2
407	 makes one for her children to protect them.	24	3	2
408	 Only a mother can make them.	24	3	2
409	 You've made them before?	24	3	2
410	 Twice.	24	3	2
411	 Did they work?	24	3	2
412	 After a fashion.	24	3	2
413	 I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.	24	3	2
414	 Many years before that,	24	3	2
415	 one of the boys came down with the pox.	24	3	2
416	 Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live.	24	3	2
417	 But it would be a very long night.	25	3	2
418	 So I sat with him all through the darkness.	25	3	2
419	 Listened to his ragged little breaths,	25	3	2
420	 his coughing, his whimpering.	25	3	2
421	 Which boy?	25	3	2
422	 Jon Snow.	25	3	2
423	 When my husband brought that baby home from the war,	25	3	2
424	 I couldn't bear to look at him.	25	3	2
425	 I didn't want to see those brown	25	3	2
426	 stranger's eyes staring up at me.	25	3	2
427	 So I prayed to the gods, take him away.	25	3	2
428	 Make him die.	25	3	2
429	 He got the pox.	25	3	2
430	 And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived.	25	3	2
431	 A murderer.	25	3	2
432	 I'd condemned this poor, innocent child	26	3	2
433	 to a horrible death	26	3	2
434	 all because I was jealous of his mother.	26	3	2
435	 A woman he didn't even know.	26	3	2
436	 So I prayed to all seven gods,	26	3	2
437	 let the boy live.	26	3	2
438	 Let him live	26	3	2
439	 and I'll love him.	26	3	2
440	 I'll be a mother to him.	26	3	2
441	 I'll beg my husband to give him a true name,	26	3	2
442	 to call him Stark and be done with it,	26	3	2
443	 to make him one of us.	26	3	2
444	 And he lived.	26	3	2
445	 And he lived.	26	3	2
446	 And I couldn't keep my promise.	26	3	2
447	 And everything that's happened since then...	26	3	2
448	 all this horror that's come to my family...	26	3	2
449	 it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child.	27	3	2
450	 Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?	27	3	2
451	 Yes.	27	3	2
452	 You liked him?	27	3	2
453	 I like you, but if you're playing us false,	27	3	2
454	 it won't be hard for me to kill you.	27	3	2
455	 I've got wildling blood in my veins.	27	3	2
456	 - These are my people. - I understand.	27	3	2
457	 Well, how could you understand?	27	3	2
458	 You want to protect your people.	27	3	2
459	 Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans,	27	3	2
460	 half of whom want to massacre the other half	27	3	2
461	 for one insult or another?	27	3	2
462	 They speak seven different languages in my army.	27	3	2
463	 The Thenns hate the Hornfoots.	27	3	2
464	 The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans.	27	3	2
465	 Everyone hates the cave people.	27	3	2
466	 So you know how I got moon worshippers	28	3	2
467	 and cannibals and giants	28	3	2
468	 to march together in the same army?	28	3	2
469	 No.	28	3	2
470	 I told them we were all going to die	28	3	2
471	 if we don't get south.	28	3	2
472	 Because that's the truth.	28	3	2
473	 Shouldn't be long now.	28	3	2
474	 ( screeching )	28	3	2
475	 What's wrong with him?	28	3	2
476	  He's a warg.	28	3	2
477	 He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes.	28	3	2
478	 He's scouting for us.	28	3	2
479	 What, you've never met a warg?	28	3	2
480	 ( screeching )	29	3	2
481	  Orell.	29	3	2
482	 ( shivers )	29	3	2
483	 Where were you this time?	29	3	2
484	 The Fist of the First Men.	29	3	2
485	 What did you see?	29	3	2
486	 ( chuckles )	29	3	2
487	 Dead crows.	29	3	2
488	 ( men coughing )	29	3	2
489	  What's the matter, Piggy?	29	3	2
490	 You crying 'cause you're cold?	29	3	2
491	 There's 200 brothers killed by dead men	29	3	2
492	 and you're still here	30	3	2
493	 whimpering.	30	3	2
494	 That seem fair to you?	30	3	2
495	 I seen 'em torn to pieces fighting	30	3	2
496	 while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole.	30	3	2
497	 Why don't you lie down and rest for a while, eh?	30	3	2
498	 You know you want to.	30	3	2
499	 Hey.	30	3	2
500	 Get up, Sam.	30	3	2
501	 - No. - Get up.	30	3	2
502	 I can't.	30	3	2
503	 If you stop, you'll die.	30	3	2
504	 'Course if you don't stop, you'll probably die, too.	30	3	2
505	 - You don't care. - 'Course we care.	30	3	2
506	 You left me.	31	3	2
507	 When the white walkers came, you left me.	31	3	2
508	 Aye, we left you.	31	3	2
509	 You're fat and you're slow.	31	3	2
510	 We didn't want to die.	31	3	2
511	 ( Sam sobbing )	31	3	2
512	 Help me get him up.	31	3	2
513	 Looks like that piggy is done for.	31	3	2
514	 - Help us get him up. - He's slowing us down.	31	3	2
515	 Just get him up!	31	3	2
516	 Why? So the rest of us can die?	31	3	2
517	 We'll move faster without him.	31	3	2
518	 What is this? Get up, Tarly.	31	3	2
519	 - Is he all right? - Aye, I think so.	31	3	2
520	 If he can't, we may as well just go without him.	31	3	2
521	 That's enough.	31	3	2
522	 Tarly,	31	3	2
523	 I forbid you to die.	31	3	2
524	 Do you hear me?	31	3	2
525	 - Why should the rest of us-- - Rast...	31	3	2
526	 you're responsible for him.	31	3	2
527	 What am I supposed to do?	31	3	2
528	 Make sure he gets back alive.	32	3	2
529	 If he doesn't, you don't.	32	3	2
530	 Move on!	32	3	2
531	 I'm not dying for you, Piggy.	32	3	2
532	 You hear me?	32	3	2
533	 - ( branch snaps ) - ( wolf growling )	32	3	2
534	 Where's Rickon and Hodor?	32	3	2
535	 Looking for food.	32	3	2
536	 ( growling )	32	3	2
537	 What's out there?	32	3	2
538	 ( growling )	33	3	2
539	 ( growling )	33	3	2
540	  Not another step, boy.	33	3	2
541	 Unless you want to drown in your own blood.	33	3	2
542	 I'm unarmed.	33	3	2
543	 That was poor planning.	33	3	2
544	 My sister carries the weapons.	33	3	2
545	 I'm better with them.	34	3	2
546	 Drop the spear.	34	3	2
547	 Drop it.	34	3	2
548	 If you kill me,	34	3	2
549	 that wolf will tear you to bits.	34	3	2
550	 ( growling )	34	3	2
551	 You must be Summer.	34	3	2
552	 ( sniffing )	34	3	2
553	 I'm Jojen Reed.	34	3	2
554	 This is my sister Meera.	34	3	2
555	 We've come a long way to find you, Brandon.	35	3	2
556	 And we have much farther to go.	35	3	2
557	  I'm just trying to understand.	35	3	2
558	  Would you please shut up about it?	35	3	2
559	 Jaqen H'ghar offered you three kills.	35	3	2
560	 - I'm not listening. - But just explain it to me.	35	3	2
561	 He offered to kill any three people you wanted.	35	3	2
562	 Dead. All you had to do was give him the names.	35	3	2
563	 Anyone. You could have picked King Joffrey.	35	3	2
564	 - Shut up. - You could have picked Tywin Lannister.	35	3	2
565	 Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal,	35	3	2
566	 so why are you complaining?	35	3	2
567	 But you could have ended the war.	35	3	2
568	 - Where are we going? - North.	35	3	2
569	 If we were going north,	35	3	2
570	 we should have come to the Red Fork River by now.	35	3	2
571	 Maybe we already passed it.	35	3	2
572	 It's 100 feet wide.	35	3	2
573	 How could we have passed it?	35	3	2
574	 If we hit the Red Fork,	35	3	2
575	 we can follow it west to Riverrun.	35	3	2
576	 My mother grew up there.	35	3	2
577	 My grandfather's a lord. He'll protect us.	35	3	2
578	 ( man singing )	35	3	2
579	 Could be a minstrel.	36	3	2
580	 Shut up.	36	3	2
581	  A lion still has claws... 	36	3	2
582	 Hot  A minstrel's got gold sometimes.	36	3	2
583	 We could jump him, tie him up, steal his gold,	36	3	2
584	 - and buy some food. - Shh.	36	3	2
585	  And so he spoke, and so he spoke 	36	3	2
586	  That Lord of Castamere 	36	3	2
587	  But now the rains 	36	3	2
588	  Weep o'er his hall 	36	3	2
589	  With no one there to hear. 	36	3	2
590	 ( gasps )	36	3	2
591	  What's lurking behind that wall?	36	3	2
592	 A lion? A wolf?	36	3	2
593	  Just a dirty little cub, I think.	36	3	2
594	 -  Loose a few more shafts. - Don't.	36	3	2
595	 Put the sword down, girl.	37	3	2
596	 You go on down the road.	37	3	2
597	 Just keep on singing so we know where you are.	37	3	2
598	 Leave us be and I won't kill you.	37	3	2
599	 ( laughing )	37	3	2
600	 Generous.	37	3	2
601	 You're a dangerous person.	37	3	2
602	 I like dangerous people.	37	3	2
603	 Why are your friends so shy?	37	3	2
604	 What friends?	37	3	2
605	 The fat one to your left and the lad beside him.	37	3	2
606	 Three young ones on the run	37	3	2
607	 carrying castle-forged swords.	37	3	2
608	 You escape from Harrenhal?	38	3	2
609	 -  Who are you? - Thoros of Myr.	38	3	2
610	 And the fellow here with the bow is Anguy.	38	3	2
611	 No, who do you fight for?	38	3	2
612	 The Brotherhood without Banners.	38	3	2
613	 Now come along.	38	3	2
614	 I want to hear how two boys	38	3	2
615	 and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal.	38	3	2
616	 I'm not going with them. The Brotherhood?	38	3	2
617	 That's who the Mountain and them lot were looking for.	38	3	2
618	 They'll bring us back and put rats in us.	38	3	2
619	 You've got nothing to fear from us, son.	38	3	2
620	 The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside.	38	3	2
621	 We're trying to save it.	38	3	2
622	 Now come on.	38	3	2
623	 We'll talk some more over brown bread and stew.	38	3	2
624	 And then you can go on your way.	38	3	2
625	 Here's the thing, fat boy.	38	3	2
626	 When I'm done talking,	38	3	2
627	 that arrow's falling down on your fat head.	38	3	2
628	 So I advise you move, because I'm done talking.	39	3	2
629	 ( men laughing )	39	3	2
630	 Half the country's starving and look at this one.	39	3	2
631	 Maybe he's the reason half the country's starving.	39	3	2
632	 My lion.	39	3	2
633	 We've spoken of this.	39	3	2
634	 You cannot come here.	39	3	2
635	 But you said I should come to you with any problems.	39	3	2
636	 Did anyone see you?	39	3	2
637	 - No. - You sure?	39	3	2
638	 My father does not make idle threats.	39	3	2
639	 Having you killed would be the high point of his week.	40	3	2
640	 You have to be absolutely certain.	40	3	2
641	 All right.	40	3	2
642	 What is this problem?	40	3	2
643	 I'm worried about Sansa.	40	3	2
644	 When she spoke with Lord Baelish,	40	3	2
645	 his friend warned me about him.	40	3	2
646	 Baelish doesn't have friends.	40	3	2
647	 I don't know her name.	40	3	2
648	 - Oh, Ros? The redhead? - How do you know her?	40	3	2
649	 I try to know as many people as I can.	40	3	2
650	 You never know which one you'll need.	40	3	2
651	 She's a whore.	40	3	2
652	 Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things.	40	3	2
653	 - You fucked her. - Oh, please.	40	3	2
654	 All right, yes, I fucked her once.	40	3	2
655	 Twice.	40	3	2
656	 But since I met you, my lady,	40	3	2
657	 I've been with no one else.	40	3	2
658	 And was she good? Did you like her?	41	3	2
659	 Not as much as I like you, obviously,	41	3	2
660	 or she'd be the one torturing me right now.	41	3	2
661	 What did she say about Littlefinger?	41	3	2
662	 That Sansa shouldn't trust him.	41	3	2
663	 Is there an idiot in any village	41	3	2
664	 who trusts Littlefinger?	41	3	2
665	 We have to protect her.	41	3	2
666	 We can't.	41	3	2
667	 Now that the Lannisters have discarded her,	41	3	2
668	 Sansa will have many suitors.	41	3	2
669	 A great beauty with a very old name.	41	3	2
670	 A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?	41	3	2
671	 Yes, she is, objectively, very.	41	3	2
672	 Her face is quite pleasing--	41	3	2
673	 to other men and to women,	41	3	2
674	 people in general.	41	3	2
675	 But not to me, of course.	41	3	2
676	 I only have eyes for you.	41	3	2
677	 You pervert. You want her?	41	3	2
678	 - This child? - I don't even want to talk about her.	42	3	2
679	 - But you are. - Only because you're making me.	42	3	2
680	 ( chuckles ) I didn't force you to open your mouth	42	3	2
681	 and make words come out.	42	3	2
682	 This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.	42	3	2
683	" ""Oh, the cruelty."	42	3	2
684	" Shae is so cruel to me."""	42	3	2
685	 Hmm, yes.	42	3	2
686	 Now do you think I'm cruel?	42	3	2
687	 Only if you stop.	42	3	2
688	 But you mustn't come here again.	42	3	2
689	 Do you hear me?	42	3	2
690	 You've come to a dangerous place	42	3	2
691	 full of dangerous people.	42	3	2
692	 Dangerous people. ( moans )	42	3	2
693	 - ( knocks ) -  Lady Tyrell, my king.	43	3	2
694	 Send her in.	43	3	2
695	 You wanted to see me, Your Grace?	43	3	2
696	 I'm leaving on a hunting trip.	43	3	2
697	 I just wanted to make sure	43	3	2
698	 you had everything you need before I left.	43	3	2
699	 That's very thoughtful, Your Grace.	43	3	2
700	 I have everything I could want.	43	3	2
701	 Good. Good.	43	3	2
702	 How are you finding life in the capital?	43	3	2
703	 It must be quite a change after Renly's camp.	43	3	2
704	 A welcome one.	43	3	2
705	 A military encampment is no place for a lady.	43	3	2
706	 And the bedside of a traitor?	43	3	2
707	 Is that a place for a lady?	44	3	2
708	 Your Grace,	44	3	2
709	 I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all.	44	3	2
710	 What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?	44	3	2
711	 The duty of any wife to any husband--	44	3	2
712	 to provide him with children.	44	3	2
713	 You failed to do this.	44	3	2
714	 - Why? - I--	44	3	2
715	 I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace.	44	3	2
716	 You think one ought to speak kindly	44	3	2
717	 of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart?	44	3	2
718	 No.	44	3	2
719	 I do beg your pardon.	44	3	2
720	 The subtleties of politics are often lost on me.	44	3	2
721	 Renly...	44	3	2
722	 I don't believe he was interested	44	3	2
723	 in the company of women.	44	3	2
724	 What makes you say this?	44	3	2
725	 Whenever I wanted to make a child with him,	45	3	2
726	 he--	45	3	2
727	 he had so many excuses,	45	3	2
728	 so many late-night war councils.	45	3	2
729	 He never wanted to try.	45	3	2
730	 Except one evening,	45	3	2
731	 after he'd had far too much wine to drink,	45	3	2
732	 he suggested something--	45	3	2
733	 something that sounded very painful	45	3	2
734	 and couldn't possibly result in children.	45	3	2
735	 Maybe the fault was with me.	45	3	2
736	 No, he was a known...	45	3	2
737	 degenerate.	45	3	2
738	 It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace.	45	3	2
739	 Mmm.	45	3	2
740	 I've considered making his perversion	45	3	2
741	 punishable by death.	45	3	2
742	 As is your right.	45	3	2
743	 You must do whatever you need to do.	45	3	2
744	 You are the king.	46	3	2
745	 Yes.	46	3	2
746	 I am.	46	3	2
747	 Do you like it?	46	3	2
748	 I just had it made.	46	3	2
749	 Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.	46	3	2
750	 It's beautiful.	46	3	2
751	 Will you show me how it works?	46	3	2
752	 It's a new design.	46	3	2
753	 Much easier to load. There's no crank.	46	3	2
754	 You use this lever to draw the string.	46	3	2
755	 The bolt goes here.	46	3	2
756	 And then you just aim...	46	3	2
757	 and...	47	3	2
758	 ( laughs )	47	3	2
759	 Would you take me hunting sometime?	47	3	2
760	 Forgive me, Your Grace.	47	3	2
761	 I know a hunt is no place for a woman.	47	3	2
762	 It's not unheard of.	47	3	2
763	 My father would never let me before--	47	3	2
764	 You no longer belong to him.	47	3	2
765	 Do you want to hold it?	47	3	2
766	 May I? Please.	47	3	2
767	 I imagine it must be so exciting	47	3	2
768	 to squeeze your finger here	47	3	2
769	 and watch something die over there.	47	3	2
770	 Could you do it?	47	3	2
771	 Could you...	47	3	2
772	 kill something?	47	3	2
773	 I don't know, Your Grace. Do you think I could?	47	3	2
774	 Yes.	47	3	2
775	 Would you like to watch me?	48	3	2
776	 Yes.	48	3	2
777	 ( screams ) Stop! Stop!	48	3	2
778	 - Tell us the truth. - About what?	48	3	2
779	 ( screams ) I don't know what you want.	48	3	2
780	 I want the truth.	48	3	2
781	 What truth?	48	3	2
782	 Why'd you take Winterfell?	48	3	2
783	 I took it to-- I took it--	48	3	2
784	 - Who gave the orders? - No one.	48	3	2
785	 - I took it on my own. - Why?	48	3	2
786	 To take the North while it was vulnerable.	48	3	2
787	 What were you going to do once you took it?	48	3	2
788	 Hold it. Rule it.	48	3	2
789	 Good. That's very good.	48	3	2
790	 ( screams )	48	3	2
791	 Why did you do that? I told you.	48	3	2
792	 Why did you take Winterfell?	48	3	2
793	 I took it to bring glory to my house and my father.	48	3	2
794	 Wait. Wait, wait, wait.	49	3	2
795	 I took it because I hated the Starks.	49	3	2
796	 I hated them for holding me prisoner.	49	3	2
797	 I wanted to hurt them.	49	3	2
798	 What are you doing?	49	3	2
799	 Please.	49	3	2
800	 ( screaming )	49	3	2
801	 I'll tell you anything.	49	3	2
802	 Just take it off.	49	3	2
803	 Please. Please, just take it off.	49	3	2
804	 ( door closes )	49	3	2
805	 - Your sister sent me. - Yara?	49	3	2
806	 ( whimpers )	49	3	2
807	 I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.	50	3	2
808	 No, don't go. Please, please.	50	3	2
809	 No, please don't leave me.	50	3	2
810	 Please, please.	50	3	2
811	 Please, please don't go!	50	3	2
812	 ( sobbing ) Please. Please. Don't leave me.	50	3	2
813	 Please don't go.	50	3	2
814	 Rickon, stay with us.	50	3	2
815	 It's all right. The wolves will protect him.	50	3	2
816	 You can get inside his head,	50	3	2
817	 see through his eyes.	50	3	2
818	 Only when I'm asleep.	50	3	2
819	 That's how it begins until you learn to control it.	50	3	2
820	 You're a warg.	50	3	2
821	 It's not just wolves.	50	3	2
822	 Sometimes in my dreams there's a--	50	3	2
823	 - A three-eyed raven? - You've seen it?	50	3	2
824	 We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?	50	3	2
825	 Does it have anything to do with warging?	51	3	2
826	 No, the raven is something different,	51	3	2
827	 something deeper.	51	3	2
828	 The raven brings the sight.	51	3	2
829	 Seeing things that haven't happened yet?	51	3	2
830	 Or things that happened long before you were born	51	3	2
831	 or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away.	51	3	2
832	 What's he telling him?	51	3	2
833	 Why don't you ask?	51	3	2
834	 Isn't he ashamed, your brother,	51	3	2
835	 needing you to protect him?	51	3	2
836	 Where's the shame in that?	51	3	2
837	 Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him	51	3	2
838	 is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.	51	3	2
839	 Some people will always need help.	51	3	2
840	 That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.	51	3	2
841	 When my father died, I dreamt it.	51	3	2
842	 You didn't dream it. You saw it.	51	3	2
843	 So did I.	52	3	2
844	 You have the sight, too?	52	3	2
845	 When I told my father about your father...	52	3	2
846	 for the first time in my life, I saw him cry.	52	3	2
847	 Your father is Howland Reed?	52	3	2
848	 Yeah.	52	3	2
849	 He saved my father's life during the rebellion.	52	3	2
850	 Your father told you about the rebellion?	52	3	2
851	 Mine never did.	52	3	2
852	 But I saw that, too.	52	3	2
853	 What else have you seen?	52	3	2
854	 Only one thing that matters--	52	3	2
855	 you.	52	3	2
856	 ( men laughing )	52	3	2
857	  I never liked the skinny ones.	52	3	2
858	 Like drinking from a puddle.	52	3	2
859	 Not that I'm averse to drinking from a puddle	52	3	2
860	 every now and again, you understand.	52	3	2
861	 I don't drink ale.	52	3	2
862	 There's no story so good a drink won't make it better.	52	3	2
863	 - Yeah! - You see?	53	3	2
864	 They've all suffered through my bouts of sobriety.	53	3	2
865	 It's very tedious for all concerned.	53	3	2
866	 Now, how did three children--	53	3	2
867	 We're not children.	53	3	2
868	 How did three young persons such as yourselves,	53	3	2
869	 untrained in the art of war,	53	3	2
870	 escape from Harrenhal?	53	3	2
871	 Gendry's a smith.	53	3	2
872	 He was apprenticed in the armory.	53	3	2
873	 A smith, eh? Where'd you train?	53	3	2
874	 King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.	53	3	2
875	 That criminal. He charges twice as much	53	3	2
876	 as every other armorer in the city.	53	3	2
877	 That's because he's twice as good.	53	3	2
878	 Aha! A smith and a salesman.	53	3	2
879	 Gendry stole us weapons.	53	3	2
880	 Ah, fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see.	53	3	2
881	 He knows how to use a sword and so do I.	53	3	2
882	 ( men laugh )	53	3	2
883	 My brothers taught me.	53	3	2
884	 ( men laugh )	53	3	2
885	  Ooh!	54	3	2
886	 ( men cheer )	54	3	2
887	 - To your brothers! - ( cheering )	54	3	2
888	 You can finish your meals before you go.	54	3	2
889	 It may be awhile before you see another.	54	3	2
890	 - You'll free us? - I gave you my word.	54	3	2
891	 But before you go,	54	3	2
892	 allow me to raise a cup to your--	54	3	2
893	 - Hey, hey. - ( men cheering )	54	3	2
894	 Now that is an uncommonly large person.	54	3	2
895	 How does one manage to subdue	54	3	2
896	 such an uncommonly large person?	54	3	2
897	 One waits for him to drink until he passes out.	54	3	2
898	 Poor man. You have my sympathy.	54	3	2
899	 Aha, not a man at all.	55	3	2
900	 - A Hound! - ( men howl and bark )	55	3	2
901	 So good to see you again, Clegane.	55	3	2
902	 Thoros?	55	3	2
903	 The fuck you doing here?	55	3	2
904	 Drinking and talking too much.	55	3	2
905	 - Same as ever. - ( men laugh )	55	3	2
906	 - A pretty prize, lads. -  Yeah!	55	3	2
907	 Girl.	55	3	2
908	 What in seven hells	55	3	2
909	 are you doing with the Stark bitch?	55	3	2
910	  It's a tough decision--	55	3	2
911	 take the bridge and risk being seen	55	3	2
912	 or cross the great water.	55	3	2
913	 - Silence, Kingslayer. - Anyone can see us on the bridge,	55	3	2
914	 but cross by water and the current could take us	55	3	2
915	 or I could escape down the river.	56	3	2
916	 Good luck.	56	3	2
917	 It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas.	56	3	2
918	 Which will she choose?	56	3	2
919	 Gambler at heart.	56	3	2
920	 Wouldn't have guessed.	56	3	2
921	 Be quick about it.	56	3	2
922	 ( Jaime groans )	56	3	2
923	 - I need to rest. - Get up.	56	3	2
924	 I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far.	56	3	2
925	 - What do you call them? - Get up now.	56	3	2
926	 Corns. I never used to get corns.	56	3	2
927	 Of course I used to ride everywhere,	56	3	2
928	 not march around like a common foot soldier	56	3	2
929	 wearing the same shit boots for over a year.	56	3	2
930	 This heel is ruined. There's no way--	56	3	2
931	 ( grunts )	56	3	2
932	 ( chuckles )	56	3	2
933	 I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.	57	3	2
934	 ( sighs )	57	3	2
935	 Ooh.	57	3	2
936	 You move well...	57	3	2
937	 for a great beast of a woman.	57	3	2
938	 You shouldn't grimace before you lunge.	57	3	2
939	 It gives away the game.	57	3	2
940	 Bit of a quandary for you.	57	3	2
941	 If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark.	57	3	2
942	 But if you don't kill me,	58	3	2
943	 I'm going to kill you.	58	3	2
944	 You're good.	58	3	2
945	 Graceless, but good.	58	3	2
946	 See? If you were willing to hurt me,	58	3	2
947	 you might have had me there.	58	3	2
948	 ( grunting )	58	3	2
949	 ( grunts )	58	3	2
950	 ( panting )	58	3	2
951	 ( groans, coughs )	58	3	2
952	 ( Jaime breathing heavily )	59	3	2
953	 ( horse neighs )	59	3	2
954	 Looks like your woman's getting the better of you,	59	3	2
955	 if you can call that a woman.	59	3	2
956	 We enjoy a good fight.	59	3	2
957	 Gets our juices flowing.	59	3	2
958	 The Flayed Man of House Bolton.	59	3	2
959	 A bit gruesome for my taste.	59	3	2
960	 - You sure he's the one? - That's him, all right.	59	3	2
961	 I saw him fight at the tourney	59	3	2
962	 for Ser Willem Frey's wedding.	59	3	2
963	 Give the man his silver.	59	3	2
964	 Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.	59	3	2
965	 Enough to buy me a new head?	59	3	2
966	 If the King in the North hears I had the Kingslayer	59	3	2
967	 and let him go, he'll be taking it right off.	59	3	2
968	 I'd rather he takes yours.	59	3	2
0	 6 -  Rider approaching! - Man 2: Open the gate!	2	2	8
1	 ( Creaking )	2	2	8
2	 ( Horses neighing )	2	2	8
3	 - Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell. - ( Men laugh )	2	2	8
4	 - Envy isn't attractive. - What envy?	2	2	8
5	 You should be proud of your brother's achievement.	3	2	8
6	 I took the great castle of Winterfell with 20 men.	3	2	8
7	 You're a great warrior.	3	2	8
8	 I saw the bodies above your gates.	3	2	8
9	 Which one gave you the tougher fight,	3	2	8
10	 the cripple or the six-year-old?	3	2	8
11	 ( Men laugh )	3	2	8
12	 I treated the Stark boys with honor	3	2	8
13	 and they repaid me with treachery.	3	2	8
14	 You treated them with honor by butchering them?	3	2	8
15	 Before I had to kill them, I treated them...	3	2	8
16	 You seized their home, as is your right.	3	2	8
17	 - We're Ironborn; We take what we need. - Exactly.	3	2	8
18	 Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away.	3	2	8
19	 Is that treachery?	3	2	8
20	 I'd call it bravery.	3	2	8
21	 They made me a promise...	3	2	8
22	 Your little boy prisoners made you a promise	3	2	8
23	 and you got mad when they broke it?	3	2	8
24	 Are you the dumbest cunt alive?	3	2	8
25	 - Don't call me a... - A cunt.	3	2	8
26	 A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell.	3	2	8
27	 You know how valuable those boys were?	3	2	8
28	 If I hadn't killed them, the Northerners would think me weak.	4	2	8
29	 You are weak. And you're stupid.	4	2	8
30	 I'm warning you.	4	2	8
31	 Go on, then,	4	2	8
32	 warn me.	4	2	8
33	 You haven't brought enough men.	4	2	8
34	 How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?	4	2	8
35	 You're not. I've come to bring you home.	4	2	8
36	 - Father wants a word. - Is this a joke?	4	2	8
37	 Winterfell is the heart of the North.	4	2	8
38	 Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea.	4	2	8
39	 We're islanders, baby brother.	4	2	8
40	 Had you forgotten that?	4	2	8
41	 Our power comes from our ships.	4	2	8
42	 And now that you've decorated your walls	4	2	8
43	 with the bodies of the Stark boys,	4	2	8
44	 every man in the North wants to see you hanged.	4	2	8
45	 When Robb Stark finds out...	4	2	8
46	 He won't find out. We've killed all the ravens.	4	2	8
47	 We have all the horses.	4	2	8
48	 I've taken Winterfell.	4	2	8
49	 And I will keep Winterfell.	5	2	8
50	 Leave us.	5	2	8
51	 Theon, you're my blood.	5	2	8
52	 We both loved our mother.	5	2	8
53	 We both endured our father.	5	2	8
54	 Come home with me. Don't die here alone.	5	2	8
55	 I don't intend to die.	5	2	8
56	 You were a terrible baby, do you know that?	5	2	8
57	 Bawling all the time, never sleeping.	5	2	8
58	 And one night you just wouldn't shut up,	5	2	8
59	 screaming like a dying pig.	5	2	8
60	 I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you.	6	2	8
61	 I wanted to strangle you.	6	2	8
62	 And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming.	6	2	8
63	 You smiled at me.	6	2	8
64	 Don't die so far from the sea.	6	2	8
65	 I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones.	6	2	8
66	 I already got one crow. Don't need two.	6	2	8
67	 Mance will want to question this one.	6	2	8
68	 Knows all about where the crows are and what they're planning.	6	2	8
69	 The Halfhand knows more. This one is just a little boy.	6	2	8
70	 Gut him.	7	2	8
71	 He could have killed me half a dozen times.	7	2	8
72	 And now he wishes he did. Gut him.	7	2	8
73	 He's a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark's son.	7	2	8
74	 Mance will want him.	7	2	8
75	 What does Mance want with a dead man's bastard?	7	2	8
76	 I don't know.	7	2	8
77	 I think he'll want to decide for himself.	7	2	8
78	 He runs, I'll chop his balls off.	7	2	8
79	 He runs, I'll do it meself.	7	2	8
80	 We're even now, Jon Snow.	7	2	8
81	 I couldn't do it.	8	2	8
82	 I had the sword at her neck, I just couldn't...	8	2	8
83	 - I know. - The others?	8	2	8
84	 When you didn't come back, we went looking for you.	8	2	8
85	 We found your tracks fast enough.	8	2	8
86	 But they found us before we found you.	8	2	8
87	 They died because of me.	8	2	8
88	 See that it wasn't for nothing.	8	2	8
89	 All right, up, lad.	8	2	8
90	 Come on, on your feet, now.	8	2	8
91	 Move it.	8	2	8
92	 ( Birds calling, water burbling )	8	2	8
93	 Is she beautiful?	8	2	8
94	 I've never met her.	8	2	8
95	 What's her name?	8	2	8
96	 Frey, I suppose.	8	2	8
97	 I don't know her first name.	8	2	8
98	 I'm sure you'll be very happy.	8	2	8
99	 ( Both laugh )	9	2	8
100	 And you're marrying her for a bridge?	9	2	8
101	 - An important bridge. - Ah.	9	2	8
102	 It was before they killed my father.	9	2	8
103	 I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time,	9	2	8
104	 but only if I crossed that bridge.	9	2	8
105	 When I speak to people from the North,	9	2	8
106	 they all loved your father.	9	2	8
107	 He was the best man I ever met.	9	2	8
108	 I know children always think that about their fathers, but...	9	2	8
109	 Children do not always think that about their fathers,	9	2	8
110	 believe me.	9	2	8
111	 He once told me that being a Lord is like being a father,	9	2	8
112	 except you have thousands of children	9	2	8
113	 and you worry about all of them.	9	2	8
114	 The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect.	9	2	8
115	 The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect.	9	2	8
116	 The soldiers you order into battle.	9	2	8
117	 He told me he woke with fear in the morning	10	2	8
118	 and went to bed with fear in the night.	10	2	8
119	 I didn't believe him.	10	2	8
120	 I asked him,	10	2	8
121	" ""how can a man be brave if he's afraid?"""	10	2	8
122	" ""That is the only time a man can be brave,"" he told me."	10	2	8
123	 I wish I could have met him.	10	2	8
124	 He would have liked you.	10	2	8
125	 Most Lords worry more about their gold	10	2	8
126	 and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors.	10	2	8
127	 He didn't care much about gold or glory.	10	2	8
128	 And you?	10	2	8
129	 You think I'm fighting this war so they'll sing songs about me?	10	2	8
130	 I want to go home.	10	2	8
131	 I want the men following me to go home.	10	2	8
132	 Then why don't you?	10	2	8
133	 Because we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated.	10	2	8
134	 And because I believe in justice.	10	2	8
135	 Chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean.	11	2	8
136	 That would be a start.	11	2	8
137	 ( Horse neighs, hoofbeats approaching )	11	2	8
138	 Your Grace, Milady.	11	2	8
139	 The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night.	11	2	8
140	 How?	11	2	8
141	 How?!	11	2	8
142	 Tell me this isn't true.	11	2	8
143	 Why?	11	2	8
144	 - For the girls. - You betrayed me.	11	2	8
145	 - Robb... - No!	11	2	8
146	 You knew I would not allow it	11	2	8
147	 and you did it anyway.	11	2	8
148	 Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell.	11	2	8
149	 Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing.	11	2	8
150	 I have five children, and only one of them is free.	11	2	8
151	 I lost one son fighting by your son's side.	12	2	8
152	 I lost another to the Kingslayer,	12	2	8
153	 strangled with a chain.	12	2	8
154	 You commit treason	12	2	8
155	 because your children are prisoners?	12	2	8
156	 I would carve out my heart	12	2	8
157	 and offer it to the father if he would let my sons	12	2	8
158	 wake from their graves and step into a prison cell.	12	2	8
159	 I grieve for your sons, My Lord.	12	2	8
160	 I don't want your grief. I want my vengeance.	12	2	8
161	 And you stole it from me.	12	2	8
162	 Killing Jaime Lannister	12	2	8
163	 would not buy life for your children,	12	2	8
164	 but returning him to King's Landing	12	2	8
165	 may buy life for mine.	12	2	8
166	 Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool.	12	2	8
167	 You've weakened our position.	12	2	8
168	 You've brought discord into our camp.	12	2	8
169	 And you did it all behind my back.	12	2	8
170	 Make sure she's guarded day and night.	13	2	8
171	 Robb.	13	2	8
172	 How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?	13	2	8
173	 40, Your Grace.	13	2	8
174	 Send another 40 with our fastest horses.	13	2	8
175	 Robb.	13	2	8
176	 ( Neighing )	13	2	8
177	 Whoa, oof!	13	2	8
178	 ( Groans )	13	2	8
179	 Damn.	13	2	8
180	 You're much uglier in daylight.	13	2	8
181	 What's your name?	13	2	8
182	 I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock,	13	2	8
183	 son of Tywin.	13	2	8
184	 A captive Knight has a right to know his captor's identity.	13	2	8
185	 Brienne of Tarth.	13	2	8
186	 Tarth, Tarth, Tarth.	13	2	8
187	 Crescent moons and starbursts.	13	2	8
188	 Lord... Selwyn Tarth,	14	2	8
189	 your father.	14	2	8
190	 Do you have any brothers and sisters, My Lady?	14	2	8
191	 It's a long way to King's Landing.	14	2	8
192	 Might as well get to know one another.	14	2	8
193	 Have you known many men?	14	2	8
194	 I suppose not.	14	2	8
195	 Women?	14	2	8
196	 Horses? Ah!	14	2	8
197	 I didn't mean to give offense, My Lady.	14	2	8
198	 Forgive me.	14	2	8
199	 Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer.	14	2	8
200	 Why do you hate me so much?	14	2	8
201	 - Have I ever harmed you? - You've harmed others...	14	2	8
202	 Those you were sworn to protect,	14	2	8
203	 the weak, the innocent.	14	2	8
204	 Has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly?	14	2	8
205	 You will not provoke me to anger.	14	2	8
206	 I already have. Look at you.	14	2	8
207	 You're ready to chop my head off.	14	2	8
208	 Do you think you could?	14	2	8
209	 Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?	14	2	8
210	 I've never seen you fight.	15	2	8
211	 The answer is no.	15	2	8
212	 There are three men in the kingdoms who might	15	2	8
213	 have a chance against me.	15	2	8
214	 You're not one of them.	15	2	8
215	 All my life men like you have sneered at me.	15	2	8
216	 And all my life I've been knocking men like you into the dust.	15	2	8
217	 If you're so confident, unlock my chains.	15	2	8
218	 Let's see what happens.	15	2	8
219	 Do you take me for an idiot? In.	15	2	8
220	 I took you for a fighter,	15	2	8
221	 a man... pardon... Woman of honor.	15	2	8
222	 Was I wrong?	15	2	8
223	 You're afraid.	15	2	8
224	 Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer.	15	2	8
225	  King's Landing will fall an hour	16	2	8
226	 after Stannis lands his force.	16	2	8
227	 It's not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei	16	2	8
228	 and the court to ride west to safety.	16	2	8
229	 Surrender the Iron Throne?	16	2	8
230	 Better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates.	16	2	8
231	 Stannis will execute them all.	16	2	8
232	 No, a king who runs will not be king for long.	16	2	8
233	 He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight.	16	2	8
234	 Stannis, two days from the capital	16	2	8
235	 and the wolf at my doorstep.	16	2	8
236	 The scouts assure us Robb Stark remains north of Ashemark.	16	2	8
237	 Ha! The last time the scouts assured us	16	2	8
238	 of Stark's movement, he lured us into a trap.	16	2	8
239	 Which is why my son is his prisoner.	16	2	8
240	 Too close to Casterly Rock.	16	2	8
241	 He sent a splinter force	16	2	8
242	 to recapture Winterfell.	16	2	8

244	 Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock	17	2	8
245	 until he's at full force.	17	2	8
246	 He's a boy and he's never lost a battle.	17	2	8
247	 He'll risk anything at any time	17	2	8
248	 because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.	17	2	8
249	 We'll ride at nightfall.	17	2	8
250	 I want a full night's march before he knows we're on the move.	17	2	8
251	 Clegane, you'll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal.	17	2	8
252	 Track down this brotherhood and destroy them.	17	2	8
253	 The girl has proven herself a good servant.	17	2	8
254	 She'll stay on with you.	17	2	8
255	 See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings.	17	2	8
256	 He's poor company when he's sober,	17	2	8
257	 but he's better at his work.	17	2	8
258	 You've got some questions to answer.	18	2	8
259	  Who killed Ser Amory?	18	2	8
260	 - Man 2: I don't know! - Give me the name.	18	2	8
261	 - Man 2: Please! - Man 3: Take this one out for the crows.	18	2	8
262	 Man 2: I told you, I don't know.	18	2	8
263	 Please.	18	2	8
264	 Look, it's Yoren's little cunt.	18	2	8
265	 Used to be a boy, now it's a girl.	18	2	8
266	 - ( Man laughs ) - Where's Jaqen?	18	2	8
267	 Don't care.	18	2	8
268	 Where's your stick now, bitch?	18	2	8
269	 I promised to fuck you with it.	18	2	8
270	  Come on, time to kill some wolves.	18	2	8
271	 ( Men shouting )	18	2	8
272	 You need sour cherries to make it right.	18	2	8
273	 And the secret is you dry the stones, and then you	18	2	8
274	 break them with a mallet.	18	2	8
275	 That's where the real flavor is.	18	2	8
276	 You crush 'em up real fine.	18	2	8
277	 And then when you're finished, you sprinkle them over the piecrust.	19	2	8
278	 - Where's Jaqen? - How would I know?	19	2	8
279	 I need him now.	19	2	8
280	 Lord Tywin's marching tonight.	19	2	8
281	 - You need him? - He's helping me.	19	2	8
282	 - Hot  I saw him. - Where?	19	2	8
283	 - Where?! - Ow!	19	2	8
284	 Where?	19	2	8
285	 They went riding out the gates a few hours ago.	19	2	8
286	 On patrol. Let go of my ears.	19	2	8
287	 ( Horses neighing, men shouting )	19	2	8
288	 What do you want with him anyway?	19	2	8
289	 ( Men shouting )	19	2	8
290	 ( Wind howling )	19	2	8
291	  Mance is gonna march on the Wall.	19	2	8
292	 When he does, one brother inside his army	19	2	8
293	 will be worth 1,000 fighting against it.	19	2	8
294	 - They'll never trust me. - They might...	19	2	8
295	 - If you do what needs to be done. - What?	20	2	8
296	 How does it feel knowing those men all died	20	2	8
297	 so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl?	20	2	8
298	 I didn't.	20	2	8
299	 I should have known better, trusting a traitor's bastard.	20	2	8
300	 He's not yours to kill, crow.	20	2	8
301	 Do you have to do that here?	20	2	8
302	 I like to keep me hands clean.	20	2	8
303	 Yes, but do you have to do it here?	20	2	8
304	 You should start wearing the gold cloak.	21	2	8
305	 I don't want to wear a gold cloak.	21	2	8
306	 You're commander of the City Watch.	21	2	8
307	 You shouldn't be dressed like a common sellsword.	21	2	8
308	 A cloak slows you down in a fight,	21	2	8
309	 makes it hard to move quietly.	21	2	8
310	 And the gold catches the light,	21	2	8
311	 so you're nice and easy to spot at night.	21	2	8
312	 Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer.	21	2	8
313	 You're supposed to stand out.	21	2	8
314	 We had a deal, and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.	21	2	8
315	 Fine, fine.	21	2	8
316	 No gold cloak.	21	2	8
317	 - What? - What?	21	2	8
318	 What? What? Why are you staring at me?	21	2	8
319	 ( Scoffs ) You don't want me cleaning me nails.	21	2	8
320	 You don't want me looking your way.	21	2	8
321	 Why am I here?	21	2	8
322	 To help me plan the defense of King's Landing.	21	2	8
323	 ( Laughs )	22	2	8
324	 Stannis will be here any day.	22	2	8

335	 Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?	22	2	8
336	 I did not know.	22	2	8
337	 And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?	22	2	8
338	 Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.	22	2	8
339	 For questioning?	22	2	8
340	 Uh, no.	22	2	8
341	 It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.	22	2	8

343	 Have you ever been in a city under siege?	23	2	8
344	 Maybe this part's not in your books.	23	2	8
345	 See, it's not the fighting that kills most people.	23	2	8
346	 It's the starving. Food's worth more than gold.	23	2	8
347	 Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes.	23	2	8
348	 Things get bad enough,	23	2	8

350	 The thieves, they love a siege.	23	2	8
351	 Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food.	23	2	8
352	 By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town.	23	2	8

362	 The mud gate.	24	2	8
363	 A good ram will batter it down in minutes	24	2	8

416	 How long after I give you the name	27	2	8

418	 A minute, an hour, a month.	28	2	8

425	 Only death. There must be others.	28	2	8
426	 Give a name, any name.	28	2	8
427	 And you'll kill them?	28	2	8

429	 By the seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting,	28	2	8
430	 I swear it.	28	2	8
431	 All right.	28	2	8
432	 Jaqen H'ghar.	28	2	8
433	 A girl gives a man his own name?	29	2	8
434	 - That's right. - Gods are not mocked.	29	2	8
435	 - This is no joking thing. - I'm not joking.	29	2	8
436	 A man can go kill himself.	29	2	8
437	 - Un-name me. - No.	29	2	8
438	 Please?	29	2	8

444	 A girl lacks honor.	29	2	8
445	 If I do this thing, a girl must obey.	29	2	8
446	 A girl will obey.	29	2	8
447	 A girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight.	29	2	8
448	 Thank you, Podrick.	29	2	8
449	 Odd little boy.	30	2	8
450	 I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.	30	2	8
451	 You and Varys both.	30	2	8
452	 Excellent lamprey pie.	30	2	8
453	 Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day?	30	2	8
454	 I hear Joffrey plans on fighting.	30	2	8
455	 An inspiration for the troops.	30	2	8
456	 The young king in his shining armor	30	2	8
457	 fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.	30	2	8
458	 He's only a boy.	30	2	8
459	 Younger boys are off fighting his war.	30	2	8
460	 He's not ready.	30	2	8
461	 What is he, 17?	30	2	8
462	 - Remember Jaime at 17? - Better than you.	30	2	8
463	 Some men have a gift for this sort of thing,	30	2	8
464	 some don't.	30	2	8
465	 His place is not on the battlefield.	30	2	8
466	 It's not on the throne, either,	30	2	8
467	 sadly for all of us.	30	2	8
468	 Do you think I'm an idiot?	31	2	8
469	 No, I'd say you possess above average intelligence.	31	2	8
470	 You shipped off my only daughter.	31	2	8
471	 And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die.	31	2	8
472	 He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him.	31	2	8
473	 He has the finest armor gold can buy.	31	2	8
474	 He needs to be out there.	31	2	8
475	 The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king	31	2	8
476	 fighting beside them	31	2	8
477	 instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts.	31	2	8
478	 Any dessert?	31	2	8
479	 Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?	31	2	8
480	 Because he has thousands of spies in his employ.	31	2	8
481	 Because he knows everything we do before we do it.	31	2	8
482	 Because he doesn't have a cock.	31	2	8
483	 Neither do you.	31	2	8
484	 Perhaps I'm dangerous, too.	31	2	8
485	 You, on the other hand,	31	2	8
486	 are as big a fool as every other man.	31	2	8
487	 That little worm between your legs	31	2	8
488	 does half your thinking.	31	2	8
489	 - It's not that little. - ( Laughs )	32	2	8
490	 Why are you smiling?	32	2	8
491	 Because I'm happy.	32	2	8
492	 And why are you happy?	32	2	8
493	 Because I have your little whore.	32	2	8
494	 I thought you preferred blondes.	32	2	8
495	 Such a droll little fellow.	32	2	8
496	 Tell me, have you married this one yet?	32	2	8
497	 No?	32	2	8
498	 Oh, good. Father will be so pleased.	32	2	8
499	 Why do you care who I fuck?	32	2	8
500	 Because a Lannister always pays her debts.	32	2	8
501	 You stole my only daughter,	32	2	8
502	 you plot to have Joffrey killed.	32	2	8
503	 This is madness. Stannis will be here in days.	32	2	8
504	 - You need me. - For what?	32	2	8
505	 Your skill in battle?	32	2	8
506	 Pretty thing, your whore.	32	2	8
507	 Lovely body.	32	2	8
508	 The bruises will heal in time.	33	2	8
509	 Where did you find her?	33	2	8
510	 Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers.	33	2	8
511	 Really, a Lannister lion necklace?	33	2	8
512	 You need to hide your secret whores more carefully.	33	2	8
513	 You've forgotten the most important thing about whores.	33	2	8
514	 Oh?	33	2	8
515	 Well, you're the expert.	33	2	8
516	 Tell me.	33	2	8
517	 You don't buy them; You only rent them.	33	2	8
518	 You're usually a better liar, baby brother.	33	2	8
519	 This one you like.	33	2	8
520	 You like her very much.	33	2	8
521	 Could it be love?	33	2	8
522	 Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough...	33	2	8
523	 unless Joffrey is hurt.	33	2	8
524	 And then every wound he suffers she'll suffer, too.	33	2	8
525	 And if he dies,	33	2	8
526	 there isn't a man alive who could devise	33	2	8
527	 a more painful death for your little cunt.	34	2	8
528	 And how do I know you haven't killed her already?	34	2	8
529	 Would you like to see her?	34	2	8
530	 I thought you might.	34	2	8
531	 Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore.	34	2	8
532	 I'm sorry they hurt you.	34	2	8
533	 You must be brave.	34	2	8
534	 I promise I will free you.	35	2	8
535	 Don't forget me.	35	2	8
536	 Never.	35	2	8
537	 ( Door opens, closes )	35	2	8
538	 I will hurt you for this.	35	2	8
539	 A day will come when you think you're safe and happy	35	2	8
540	 and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth.	35	2	8
541	 And you will know the debt is paid.	35	2	8
542	 Get out.	35	2	8
543	 Shae!	36	2	8
544	 I've been waiting all night.	36	2	8
545	 What is wrong?	36	2	8
546	 You're beautiful.	36	2	8
547	 Then why do you look sad?	36	2	8
548	 We have to be more careful.	36	2	8
549	 Don't be afraid. I can take care of myself.	36	2	8
550	 There are people who want to hurt me.	36	2	8
551	 I know. I won't let them.	36	2	8
552	 I'll cut off their faces. I will.	36	2	8
553	 I would kill for you. Do you know that?	36	2	8
554	 I expect I'll have to before this is over.	36	2	8
555	 You're mine.	37	2	8
556	 I'm yours.	37	2	8
557	 Promise me.	37	2	8
558	 I'm yours, and you are mine.	37	2	8
559	  Still no word?	37	2	8
560	 We've sent a dozen ravens.	37	2	8
561	 None have returned.	37	2	8
562	 My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell.	37	2	8
563	 - Once he captures the castle... - Theon has my brothers.	37	2	8
564	 - If we storm the castle... - He wouldn't dare hurt the boys.	37	2	8
565	 They're his only hope of escaping the North with his head.	37	2	8
566	 Send word to your son.	38	2	8
567	 Any Ironborn who surrender	38	2	8
568	 will be allowed to return safely to their homes.	38	2	8
569	 A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace. Too much...	38	2	8
570	 Any ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy.	38	2	8
571	 He betrayed our cause.	38	2	8
572	 He betrayed me.	38	2	8
573	 And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs.	38	2	8
574	 I expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute	38	2	8
575	 they hear the offer.	38	2	8
576	 Your pardon, My Lord. Your Grace.	38	2	8
577	 My Lady.	38	2	8
578	 How are you?	38	2	8
579	 How am I?	38	2	8
580	 I've had to arrest my mother.	38	2	8
581	 The Lannisters have my sisters.	38	2	8
582	 The man I considered my closest friend	39	2	8
583	 has seized my home and my brothers.	39	2	8
584	 I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.	39	2	8
585	 I'm sorry. It was a stupid question.	39	2	8
586	 - I'm sorry. - No.	39	2	8
587	 Forgive me.	39	2	8
588	 You're being kind. I have no right.	39	2	8
589	 You have every right.	39	2	8
590	 You're a king.	39	2	8
591	 That's not the kind of king I want to be.	39	2	8
592	 What kind do you want to be?	39	2	8
593	 I don't know. The good kind.	39	2	8
594	 Most kings grew up as princes.	39	2	8
595	 They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown.	39	2	8
596	 I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.	39	2	8
597	 I was raised to be a proper little lady,	39	2	8
598	 to play the harp and dance the latest steps	39	2	8
599	 and recite Valyrian poetry.	39	2	8
600	 I'd like to hear you play the harp.	39	2	8
601	 No. No, you would not.	39	2	8
602	 ( Laughs )	40	2	8
603	 How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry	40	2	8
604	 to sawing off men's feet?	40	2	8
605	 When I was 12,	40	2	8
606	 my mother and father went to a wedding.	40	2	8
607	 Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know.	40	2	8
608	 And they left me with my little brother.	40	2	8
609	 The second afternoon they were gone	40	2	8
610	 was the hottest day in the three-year summer.	40	2	8
611	 We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne.	40	2	8
612	 Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day.	40	2	8
613	 The rich, the poor, we were all there,	40	2	8
614	 naked, screaming, racing to the little islands.	40	2	8
615	 Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank.	41	2	8
616	 I was treading water,	41	2	8
617	 talking to a friend	41	2	8
618	 when I realized I hadn't seen my brother.	41	2	8
619	 I called his name.	41	2	8
620	 Then I started screaming his name.	41	2	8
621	 And then I saw him	41	2	8
622	 floating facedown.	41	2	8
623	 My heart just... stopped.	41	2	8
624	 I was...	41	2	8
625	 I dragged him from the water.	41	2	8
626	 My friend helped me, I think.	41	2	8
627	 I don't even remember.	41	2	8
628	 He was so little.	41	2	8
629	 Then we pulled him onto the riverbank...	41	2	8
630	 and I screamed at him	42	2	8
631	 and I shook him	42	2	8
632	 and he was dead.	42	2	8
633	 Just dead.	42	2	8
634	 A man ran over.	42	2	8
635	 He had a fish tattoo on his face.	42	2	8
636	 In Volantis the slaves have tattoos	42	2	8
637	 so you know what they are without having to talk to them.	42	2	8
638	 And this man worked on a fishing boat.	42	2	8
639	 And he pushed me out of the way.	42	2	8
640	 You have to understand,	42	2	8
641	 for a slave to push a highborn girl...	42	2	8
642	 That's death for the man, a terrible death.	42	2	8
643	 But he pushed me out of the way	42	2	8
644	 and he started pressing on my brother's chest	42	2	8
645	 again and again and again	42	2	8
646	 until my brother spat out	43	2	8
647	 half of the Rhoyne	43	2	8
648	 and cried out.	43	2	8
649	 And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm.	43	2	8
650	 I decided two things that day.	43	2	8
651	 I would not waste my years	43	2	8
652	 planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies.	43	2	8
653	 And when I came of age...	43	2	8
654	 I would never live in a slave city again.	43	2	8
655	 ( Sighs ) I'm sorry, Your Grace.	43	2	8
656	 You told me of your problems and I've blathered on.	43	2	8
657	 I don't want to marry the Frey girl.	43	2	8
658	 I don't want you to marry her.	44	2	8
659	 But you needed that bridge.	44	2	8
660	 I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.	44	2	8
661	 ( Laughs )	44	2	8
662	 Hot  The sour cherries was all crushed up and ready.	45	2	8
663	  Shut up.	45	2	8
664	 Probably in the piecrust by now.	45	2	8
665	 In the oven, the nice warm oven.	45	2	8
666	 Shut up. What did you bring?	45	2	8
667	 The cheese could be better.	45	2	8
668	 I did get some nice sausages.	45	2	8
669	 What did he want us to do about those guards?	45	2	8
670	 He didn't say.	45	2	8
671	" He just said, ""walk through the gates."""	45	2	8
672	  What about the guards?	45	2	8
673	 He didn't say anything about the guards.	45	2	8
674	 What, he left that bit out?	45	2	8
675	 It's a pretty important part, don't you think?	45	2	8
676	 - We have to trust him. - Trust him?	45	2	8
677	 You trusted him to fight with us and you set him free	46	2	8
678	 - and he ran. - I want to go back to the kitchens.	46	2	8
679	 Shut up. Stay here if you're afraid.	46	2	8
680	 Hot  Arry, don't.	46	2	8
681	 Away! Reset!	46	2	8
682	 If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day.	46	2	8
683	 Will it hold?	47	2	8
684	 Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace.	47	2	8
685	  Again, pull!	47	2	8
686	 I admire you, Ser Davos.	47	2	8
687	 I thank you, Your Grace. Pleased to hear it.	47	2	8
688	 Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight	47	2	8
689	 and think they insult you.	47	2	8
690	 So you take the onion for your sigil,	47	2	8
691	 sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag.	47	2	8
692	 My son wishes me to change it.	47	2	8
693	 Three mermen with tridents, something like that.	47	2	8
694	 I understand why the older families look down at me.	47	2	8
695	 Do you? Why?	47	2	8
696	 - My father was a crabber. - And?	47	2	8
697	 Well, sons of Lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers.	47	2	8
698	 Our hands stink.	47	2	8
699	 And where were those Lords when Storm's End starved?	47	2	8
700	 Many fought bravely for your brother.	47	2	8
701	 Many fought for the Mad King.	48	2	8
702	 You defend these men who insult you behind your back.	48	2	8
703	 Some are happy to do it to my face.	48	2	8
704	 We were forgotten.	48	2	8
705	 Robert and Ned Stark... They were the heroes,	48	2	8
706	 the glorious rebels marching from battle to battle,	48	2	8
707	 liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King	48	2	8
708	 while I held Storm's End with 500 men.	48	2	8
709	 - No one has forgotten, Your Grace. - No? Robert did.	48	2	8
710	 He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war.	48	2	8
711	 Renly never fought a day in his life.	48	2	8
712	 - He was only a boy. - Then why'd he give him Storm's End?	48	2	8
713	 First we ate the horses.	48	2	8
714	 We weren't riding anyway, not with the castle surrounded.	48	2	8
715	 We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses.	48	2	8
716	 Then the cats. Never liked cats.	48	2	8
717	 So fine. I do like dogs.	48	2	8
718	 Good animals. Loyal.	48	2	8
719	 But we ate them. Then the rats.	48	2	8
720	 The night before you slipped through,	48	2	8
721	 I thought my wife was dying.	49	2	8
722	 She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail.	49	2	8
723	 And then you made it through the lines.	49	2	8
724	 Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions.	49	2	8
725	 And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe.	49	2	8
726	 Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.	49	2	8
727	 I was relieved they did not.	49	2	8
728	 Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it.	49	2	8
729	 Then he told me he was giving it to Renly,	49	2	8
730	 so I gave it up.	49	2	8
731	 Insult or no, I gave it up	49	2	8
732	 because Robert was my older brother and he was the king	49	2	8
733	 and I've always done my duty.	49	2	8
734	 But now I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros.	49	2	8
735	 And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand.	49	2	8
736	 Your Grace...	49	2	8
737	 I pray I serve you well.	49	2	8
738	 I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.	49	2	8
739	 You're the master of whisperers.	50	2	8
740	 You're supposed to know everything.	50	2	8
741	 No man can be in all rooms at all times.	50	2	8
742	 I have many little birds in the North, My Lord,	50	2	8
743	 but I haven't heard their songs	50	2	8
744	 since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.	50	2	8
745	 The Stark forces are distracted.	50	2	8
746	 Now is the time to strike.	50	2	8
747	 To strike?	50	2	8
748	 My dear nephew, you do see these men	50	2	8
749	 preparing the walls for siege?	50	2	8
750	 You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?	50	2	8
751	 If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King's Landing,	50	2	8
752	 I'll ride out to greet him.	50	2	8
753	 A brave choice, Your Grace.	50	2	8
754	 I'm sure your men will line up behind you.	50	2	8
755	 They say Stannis never smiles.	50	2	8
756	 I'll give him a red smile	50	2	8
757	 from ear to ear.	50	2	8
758	 Imagine Stannis's terror.	51	2	8
759	 I am trying.	51	2	8
760	 You're an intelligent man.	51	2	8
761	 I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.	51	2	8
762	 Oh, no one disputes that, My Lord,	51	2	8
763	 not even the multitudes who despise you.	51	2	8
764	 I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men.	51	2	8
765	 I wish we could, too.	51	2	8
766	 What do you want?	51	2	8
767	 Tell me.	51	2	8
768	 If we're going to play,	51	2	8
769	 you'll have to start.	51	2	8
770	 My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history.	51	2	8
771	 My sister became queen at the age of 19.	51	2	8
772	 When I reached manhood,	51	2	8
773	 my father put me in charge of all the drains	51	2	8
774	 and cisterns in Casterly Rock.	51	2	8
775	 A most highborn plumber.	51	2	8
776	 The water never flowed better.	51	2	8
777	 And all the shit found its way to the sea.	51	2	8
778	 I never expected to have any real power.	52	2	8
779	 So when my father named me acting Hand...	52	2	8
780	 You're quite good at being Hand, you know?	52	2	8
781	 Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men,	52	2	8
782	 honorable men,	52	2	8
783	 but they disdained the game and those who played.	52	2	8
784	 - You enjoy the game. - I do.	52	2	8
785	 Last thing I expected.	52	2	8
786	 And you play it well.	52	2	8
787	 I'd like to keep playing it.	52	2	8
788	 If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over.	52	2	8
789	 They say he burns his enemies alive	52	2	8
790	 to honor the Lord of Light.	52	2	8
791	 The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned,	52	2	8
792	 the Drowned God wants them drowned.	52	2	8
793	 Why are all the Gods such vicious cunts?	52	2	8
794	 Where is the God of tits and wine?	52	2	8
795	 In the Summer Isles,	52	2	8
796	 they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats.	52	2	8
797	 We should sail there immediately.	52	2	8
798	 This morning I heard a song	53	2	8
799	 all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste.	53	2	8
800	 Daenerys Targaryen lives.	53	2	8
801	 A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.	53	2	8
802	 She has three dragons.	53	2	8
803	 But even if what they say is true,	53	2	8
804	 it'll be years before they are fully grown.	53	2	8
805	 And then there will be nowhere to hide.	53	2	8
806	 One game at a time, my friend.	53	2	8
807	 ( Men shouting )	53	2	8
808	  Careful, Khaleesi.	53	2	8
809	 Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have 1,000	53	2	8
810	 eyes watching for you.	53	2	8
811	 I found one...	53	2	8
812	 A ship with a good captain.	53	2	8
813	 She leaves for Astapor tomorrow.	53	2	8
814	 - Astapor? - We cannot stay here.	54	2	8
815	 They have my dragons.	54	2	8
816	 A mother does not flee without her children.	54	2	8
817	 They're not your children.	54	2	8
818	 I know they call you the Mother of Dragons	54	2	8
819	 and I know you love them, but you didn't grow them in your womb.	54	2	8
820	 They didn't suckle at your breast. They are dragons, Khaleesi.	54	2	8
821	 And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die.	54	2	8
822	 You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there.	54	2	8
823	 You know I would die for you.	54	2	8
824	 I will never abandon you.	54	2	8
825	 I'm sworn to protect you, to serve.	54	2	8
826	 Then serve me.	54	2	8
827	 If my dragons are in the House of the Undying,	54	2	8
828	 then take me there.	54	2	8
829	 That's what the warlock wants.	54	2	8
830	 He told you so himself.	54	2	8
831	 If you enter that place, you will never leave again.	54	2	8
832	 - His magic is strong. - And what of my magic?	54	2	8
833	 You saw me step into the fire.	54	2	8
834	 You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me?	54	2	8
835	 Do you remember?	54	2	8
836	 Until my last breath I will remember.	55	2	8
837	 After I have forgotten my mother's face.	55	2	8
838	 They are my children.	55	2	8
839	 And they are the only children I will ever have.	55	2	8
840	 Take me to them.	55	2	8
841	 We should bury them.	55	2	8
842	 I'd leave 'em up a few more days.	55	2	8
843	 Sends a message.	55	2	8
844	 If they haven't got the damn message yet,	55	2	8
845	 a few more days won't help.	55	2	8
846	 As you say.	55	2	8
847	 But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer.	56	2	8
848	 What's this?	56	2	8
849	 Gold for the farmer.	56	2	8
850	 For his trouble.	56	2	8
851	 His troubles are done.	56	2	8
852	 He's feeding the crops now.	56	2	8
853	 His wife, too.	56	2	8
854	 You want to keep a man silent, you silence him.	56	2	8
855	 Got as far as the farm and then doubled back.	56	2	8
856	 Walked through the stream to throw off the hounds.	56	2	8
857	 Hoped this would be the last place they'd think to look.	56	2	8
858	 You're right...	57	2	8
859	 so far.	57	2	8
860	 Who was that out there	57	2	8
861	 hung up the gates?	57	2	8
862	 Must have been the farmer's boys.	57	2	8
863	 He killed them and burned them	57	2	8
864	 and passed them off as the little lords?	57	2	8
865	 Shh, shh, shh.	57	2	8
866	 They mustn't know.	57	2	8
867	 Bran would blame himself.	57	2	8
868	  They'll never hear it from me.	57	2	8
869	 The little lads have suffered enough.	57	2	8
0	 1 There was a raven from King's Landing.	0	1	2
1	 Jon Arryn is dead.	0	1	2
2	 The King rides for Winterfell	0	1	2
3	 with the Queen and all the rest of them.	0	1	2
4	 The Queen has two brothers?	0	1	2
5	 There's the pretty one, and there's the clever one.	0	1	2
6	 I would name you the Hand of the King.	0	1	2
7	 We were meant to rule together.	0	1	2
8	 I have a son, you have a daughter. We'll join our houses.	0	1	2
9	 The boy I beheaded-- he was talking madness.	0	1	2
10	 Said the others slaughtered his friends.	0	1	2
11	 -  A Wildling ambush. - Maybe.	0	1	2
12	 You're Tyrion Lannister.	0	1	2
13	 You-- you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?	0	1	2
14	 Let me give you some advice, bastard.	0	1	2
15	 Never forget what you are and it can never be used to hurt you.	0	1	2
16	 It's a direwolf.	0	1	2
17	 There are no direwolves south of the wall.	0	1	2
18	 Now there are five, one for each of the Stark children.	0	1	2
19	 - What about you? - I'm not a Stark.	0	1	2
20	 That one's yours, Snow.	0	1	2
21	 May I present Viserys of House Targaryen,	1	1	2
22	 the rightful King of the Andals,	1	1	2
23	 and his sister Daenerys?	1	1	2
24	 I don't want to be his queen. I want to go home.	1	1	2
25	 We go home with an army-- with Khal Drogo's army.	1	1	2
26	 From your sister.	1	1	2
27	 She says Jon Arryn was murdered by the Lannisters.	1	1	2
28	 She says the King is in danger.	1	1	2
29	 What if Jon Arryn told someone?	1	1	2
30	 Whatever Jon Arryn knew died with him.	1	1	2
31	 The things I do for love.	1	1	2
32		1	1	2
33		1	1	2
34	  	1	1	2
35	 You need to drink, child.	3	1	2
36	 And eat.	4	1	2
37	 Isn't there anything else?	4	1	2
38	 The Dothraki have two things in abundance:	4	1	2
39	 Grass and horses. People can't live on grass.	4	1	2
40	 In the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai,	4	1	2
41	 they say there are fields of ghost grass	4	1	2
42	 with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night.	4	1	2
43	 It murders all other grass.	4	1	2
44	 The Dothraki believe that one day	4	1	2
45	 it will cover everything-- that's the way the world will end.	4	1	2
46	 It'll get easier.	5	1	2
47	 Khaleesi!	5	1	2
48	 Your hands.	5	1	2
49	 We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace.	6	1	2
50	 Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality.	6	1	2
51	 You'd be more comfortable there.	6	1	2
52	 I have no interest in hospitality or comfort.	6	1	2
53	 I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfills	6	1	2
54	 his end of the bargain and I have my crown.	6	1	2
55	 As you wish, your Grace.	6	1	2
56	 Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is,	6	1	2
57	 I suppose it is preferable to beheading.	6	1	2
58	 What did Ned Stark want you for?	6	1	2
59	 Buying from a slaver?	6	1	2
60	 Selling to one--	6	1	2
61	 some poachers I caught on my land.	6	1	2
62	 Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense.	6	1	2
63	 You can rest assured of that.	6	1	2
64	 Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle.	7	1	2
65	 My mother's been looking for you.	7	1	2
66	 We ride for King's Landing today.	7	1	2
67	 Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark	7	1	2
68	 and offer your sympathies.	7	1	2
69	 What good will my sympathies do them?	7	1	2
70	 None. But it is expected of you.	7	1	2
71	 Your absence has already been noted.	7	1	2
72	 The boy means nothing to me.	7	1	2
73	 And I can't stand the wailing of women.	7	1	2
74	 One word and I'll hit you again.	7	1	2
75	 I'm telling mother!	7	1	2
76	 Go! Tell her.	7	1	2
77	 But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark	7	1	2
78	 and you will fall on your knees in front of them	7	1	2
79	 and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service,	7	1	2
80	 and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?	8	1	2
81	 You can't--	8	1	2
82	 Do you understand?	8	1	2
83	 The prince will remember that, little lord.	8	1	2
84	 I hope so.	8	1	2
85	 If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him.	8	1	2
86	 Ah. Time for breakfast.	8	1	2
87	 Bread. And two of those little fish.	8	1	2
88	 And a mug of dark beer to wash it down.	8	1	2
89	 And bacon, burned black.	8	1	2
90	 Hyah.	8	1	2
91	 - Little brother. - Beloved siblings.	8	1	2
92	 Is Bran going to die?	9	1	2
93	 Apparently not.	9	1	2
94	 - What do you mean? - The Maester says the boy may live.	9	1	2
95	 It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain.	9	1	2
96	 Only the gods know for certain.	9	1	2
97	 All the rest of us can do is pray.	9	1	2
98	 The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.	9	1	2
99	 I still can't believe you're going.	9	1	2
100	 It's ridiculous even for you.	9	1	2
101	 Where's your sense of wonder?	9	1	2
102	 The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of The Night's Watch,	9	1	2
103	 the wintry abode of the White Walkers.	9	1	2
104	 Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.	9	1	2
105	 And go celibate? The whores would go begging	9	1	2
106	 from Dorne to Casterly Rock.	9	1	2
107	 No, I just want to stand on top of the wall	9	1	2
108	 and piss off the edge of the world.	9	1	2
109	 The children don't need to hear your filth.	10	1	2
110	 Come.	10	1	2
111	 Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque.	10	1	2
112	 Give me a good clean death any day.	10	1	2
113	 Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree.	10	1	2
114	 Death is so final, whereas life...	10	1	2
115	 Ah, life is full of possibilities.	10	1	2
116	 I hope the boy does wake.	10	1	2
117	 I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say.	10	1	2
118	 My dear brother,	10	1	2
119	 there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on.	10	1	2
120	 My dear brother, you wound me.	10	1	2
121	 You know how much I love my family.	10	1	2
122	 Please.	11	1	2
123	 Oh, I would have dressed, your Grace.	11	1	2
124	 This is your home. I'm your guest.	11	1	2
125	 Handsome one, isn't he?	11	1	2
126	 I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty.	11	1	2
127	 He was a fighter too--	11	1	2
128	 tried to beat the fever that took him.	11	1	2
129	 Forgive me.	11	1	2
130	 It's the last thing you need to hear right now.	11	1	2
131	 I never knew.	11	1	2
132	 It was years ago.	11	1	2
133	 Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall,	11	1	2
134	 all the things men do to show you how much they care.	11	1	2
135	 The boy looked just like him.	12	1	2
136	 Such a little thing...	12	1	2
137	 A bird without feathers.	12	1	2
138	 They came to take his body away and Robert held me.	12	1	2
139	 I screamed and I battled, but he held me.	12	1	2
140	 That little bundle.	12	1	2
141	 They took him away and I never saw him again.	12	1	2
142	 Never have visited the crypt, never.	12	1	2
143	 I pray to the mother every morning and night	12	1	2
144	 that she return your child to you.	12	1	2
145	 I am grateful.	12	1	2
146	 Perhaps this time she'll listen.	12	1	2
147	 A sword for the wall?	13	1	2
148	 - I already have one. - Good man.	13	1	2
149	 - Have you swung it yet? - Of course I have.	14	1	2
150	 At someone, I mean.	14	1	2
151	 It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man.	14	1	2
152	 You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat	14	1	2
153	 and blood and some bone to keep it all standing.	14	1	2
154	 Let me thank you ahead of time	14	1	2
155	 for guarding us all from the perils beyond the wall--	14	1	2
156	 Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot.	14	1	2
157	 We're grateful to have	14	1	2
158	 good, strong men like you protecting us.	14	1	2
159	 We've guarded the kingdoms for 8,000 years.	14	1	2
160	" Is it ""we"" already?"	14	1	2
161	 Have you taken your vows then?	14	1	2
162	 Soon enough.	14	1	2
163	 Give my regards to The Night's Watch.	14	1	2
164	 I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force.	15	1	2
165	 And if not?	15	1	2
166	 It's only for life.	15	1	2
167	 Thank you, Nymeria.	15	1	2
168	 Septa Mordane says I have to do it again.	15	1	2
169	 My things weren't properly folded, she says.	15	1	2
170	 Who cares how they're folded?!	15	1	2
171	 They're going to get all messed up anyway.	15	1	2
172	 It's good you've got help.	15	1	2
173	 Watch.	15	1	2
174	 Nymeria, gloves.	15	1	2
175	 - Impressive. - Shut up.	16	1	2
176	 Nymeria, gloves!	16	1	2
177	 I have something for you.	16	1	2
178	 And it has to be packed very carefully.	16	1	2
179	 A present?	16	1	2
180	 Close the door.	16	1	2
181	 This is no toy.	16	1	2
182	 Be careful you don't cut yourself.	16	1	2
183	 - It's so skinny. - So are you.	16	1	2
184	 I had the blacksmith make it for you special.	16	1	2
185	 It won't hack a man's head off,	16	1	2
186	 but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough.	16	1	2
187	 I can be quick.	16	1	2
188	 You'll have to work at it every day.	16	1	2
189	 How does it feel?	16	1	2
190	 Do you like the balance?	16	1	2
191	 I think so.	17	1	2
192	 First lesson: Stick them with the pointy end.	17	1	2
193	 I know which end to use.	17	1	2
194	 I'm going to miss you.	17	1	2
195	 Careful.	17	1	2
196	 All the best swords have names, you know.	17	1	2
197	 Sansa can keep her sewing needles.	17	1	2
198	 I've got a needle of my own.	17	1	2
199	 I came to say goodbye to Bran.	18	1	2
200	 You've said it.	18	1	2
201	 I wish I could be here when you wake up.	18	1	2
202	 I'm going north with Uncle Benjen.	18	1	2
203	 I'm taking the black.	18	1	2
204	 I know we always talked about seeing the wall together,	18	1	2
205	 but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better.	18	1	2
206	 I'll know my way around by then.	18	1	2
207	 I'll be a sworn brother of The Night's Watch.	18	1	2
208	 We can go out walking beyond the wall, if you're not afraid.	18	1	2
209	 I want you	19	1	2
210	 to leave.	19	1	2
211	 17 years ago	20	1	2
212	 you rode off with Robert Baratheon.	20	1	2
213	 You came back a year later with another woman's son.	20	1	2
214	 And now you're leaving again.	20	1	2
215	 I have no choice.	20	1	2
216	 That's what men always say when honor calls.	20	1	2
217	 That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves.	20	1	2
218	 You do have a choice.	20	1	2
219	 And you've made it.	20	1	2
220	 Cat--	21	1	2
221	 I can't do it, Ned.	21	1	2
222	 - I really can't. - You can.	21	1	2
223	 You must.	21	1	2
224	 You've said goodbye to Bran?	21	1	2
225	 He's not going to die. I know it.	21	1	2
226	 You Starks are hard to kill.	21	1	2
227	 My mother?	22	1	2
228	 - She was very kind. - Good.	22	1	2
229	 Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.	22	1	2
230	 It was always my color.	22	1	2
231	 - Farewell, Snow. - And you, Stark.	22	1	2
232	 There's great honor serving in The Night's Watch.	23	1	2
233	 The Starks have manned the wall for thousands of years.	23	1	2
234	 And you are a Stark.	23	1	2
235	 You might not have my name,	23	1	2
236	 but you have my blood.	23	1	2
237	 Is my mother alive?	23	1	2
238	 Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going?	23	1	2
239	 Does she care?	23	1	2
240	 The next time we see each other,	23	1	2
241	 we'll talk about your mother.	23	1	2
242	 Huh?	23	1	2
243	 I promise.	23	1	2
244	 Gods, this is country!	24	1	2
245	 I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going.	24	1	2
246	 I've half a mind to go with you.	24	1	2
247	 What do you say, just you and me	24	1	2
248	 on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides,	24	1	2
249	 a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight.	24	1	2
250	 You should have asked me 20 years ago.	25	1	2
251	 There were wars to fight, women to marry--	25	1	2
252	 we never had the chance to be young.	25	1	2
253	 I recall a few chances.	25	1	2
254	 There was that one... Oh, what was her name?	25	1	2
255	 That common girl of yours?	25	1	2
256	 Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in.	25	1	2
257	 Bessie. She was one of yours.	25	1	2
258	 Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie	25	1	2
259	 and her tits.	25	1	2
260	 Yours was... Aleena?	25	1	2
261	 No. You told me once. Meryl?	25	1	2
262	 Your bastard's mother?	25	1	2
263	 - Wylla. - That's it.	25	1	2
264	 She must have been a rare wench	25	1	2
265	 to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor.	25	1	2
266	 You never told me what she looked like.	25	1	2
267	 Nor will I.	25	1	2
268	 We were at war.	26	1	2
269	 None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again.	26	1	2
270	 You're too hard on yourself. You always have been.	26	1	2
271	 I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already.	26	1	2
272	 The worst thing about your coronation--	26	1	2
273	 I'll never get to hit you again.	26	1	2
274	 Trust me, that's not the worst thing.	26	1	2
275	 There was a rider in the night.	26	1	2
276	 Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord.	26	1	2
277	 What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?	26	1	2
278	 A knife perhaps, a good sharp one,	26	1	2
279	 and a bold man to wield it.	26	1	2
280	 She's little more than a child.	26	1	2
281	 Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.	26	1	2
282	 - Tell me we're not speaking of this. - Oh, it's unspeakable to you?	26	1	2
283	 What her father did to your family-- that was unspeakable.	26	1	2
284	 What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister--	27	1	2
285	 the woman I loved.	27	1	2
286	 I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.	27	1	2
287	 But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?	27	1	2
288	 This Khal Drogo,	27	1	2
289	 it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde.	27	1	2
290	 Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm,	27	1	2
291	 as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea.	27	1	2
292	 They have no ships, Robert.	27	1	2
293	 There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me usurper.	27	1	2
294	 If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back,	27	1	2
295	 - the scum will join him. - He will not cross.	27	1	2
296	 And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea.	27	1	2
297	 There's a war coming, Ned.	27	1	2
298	 I don't know when,	27	1	2
299	 I don't know who we'll be fighting,	27	1	2
300	 but it's coming.	27	1	2
301	 Sit.	29	1	2
302	 You'll be fed.	29	1	2
303	 Untie them.	29	1	2
304	 Ah, rapers.	29	1	2
305	 They were given a choice no doubt-- castration or the wall.	29	1	2
306	 Most choose the knife.	29	1	2
307	 Not impressed by your new brothers?	29	1	2
308	 Lovely thing about the watch--	29	1	2
309	 you discard your old family and get a whole new one.	29	1	2
310	 Why do you read so much?	30	1	2
311	 Look at me and tell me what you see.	30	1	2
312	 Is this a trick?	30	1	2
313	 What you see is a dwarf.	30	1	2
314	 If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die.	30	1	2
315	 Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock.	30	1	2
316	 Things are expected of me.	30	1	2
317	 My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.	30	1	2
318	 Until your brother killed that King.	30	1	2
319	 Yes, until my brother killed him.	30	1	2
320	 Life is full of these little ironies.	30	1	2
321	 My sister married the new King	30	1	2
322	 and my repulsive nephew will be King after him.	30	1	2
323	 I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree?	30	1	2
324	 But how?	31	1	2
325	 Well, my brother has his sword	31	1	2
326	 and I have my mind.	31	1	2
327	 And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone.	31	1	2
328	 That's why I read so much, Jon Snow.	31	1	2
329	 And you?	31	1	2
330	 What's your story, bastard?	31	1	2
331	 Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.	31	1	2
332	 A bastard boy with nothing to inherit,	31	1	2
333	 off to join	31	1	2
334	 the ancient order of The Night's Watch,	31	1	2
335	 alongside his Valiant brothers-in-arms.	31	1	2
336	 The Night's Watch protects the realm from--	31	1	2
337	 ah, yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks	31	1	2
338	 and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about.	31	1	2
339	 You're a smart boy.	31	1	2
340	 You don't believe that nonsense.	32	1	2
341	 Everything's better with some wine in the belly.	32	1	2
342	 It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady.	32	1	2
343	 You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us.	32	1	2
344	 Talk to Poole about it.	33	1	2
345	 Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady.	33	1	2
346	 We need a new steward,	33	1	2
347	 and there are several other appointments that require	33	1	2
348	 - our immediate attention-- - I don't care about appointments!	33	1	2
349	 I'll make the appointments.	33	1	2
350	 We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.	33	1	2
351	 Very good, my Lord.	33	1	2
352	 My Lady.	33	1	2
353	 When was the last time you left this room?	33	1	2
354	 I have to take care of him.	33	1	2
355	 He's not going to die, mother.	33	1	2
356	 Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed.	33	1	2
357	 What if he's wrong?	33	1	2
358	 - Bran needs me. - Rickon needs you.	34	1	2
359	 He's six.	34	1	2
360	 He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day,	34	1	2
361	 - clutching my leg, crying-- - close the windows!	34	1	2
362	 I can't stand it! Please make them stop!	34	1	2
363	 Fire.	34	1	2
364	 You stay here. I'll come back.	34	1	2
365	 You're not supposed to be here.	34	1	2
366	 No one is supposed to be here.	34	1	2
367	 It's a mercy. He's dead already.	34	1	2
368	 No!	34	1	2
369	 - Have you ever seen a dragon? - Dragon gone, Khaleesi.	36	1	2
370	 Everywhere? Even in the east?	36	1	2
371	 No dragon. Brave men kill them.	36	1	2
372	 - It is known. - It is known.	36	1	2
373	 A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.	36	1	2
374	 The moon?	36	1	2
375	 He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi,	36	1	2
376	 that once there were two moons in the sky.	36	1	2
377	 But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat.	36	1	2
378	 Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons	36	1	2
379	 and they drank the sun's fire.	36	1	2
380	 Moon is no egg.	36	1	2
381	 Moon is goddess-- wife of sun.	36	1	2
382	 - It is known. - It is known.	36	1	2
383	 Leave me with her.	36	1	2
384	 Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?	37	1	2
385	 Men like to talk when they're happy.	37	1	2
386	 Before your brother bought me for you,	37	1	2
387	 it was my job to make men happy.	37	1	2
388	 - How old were you? - I was nine	37	1	2
389	 when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.	37	1	2
390	 Nine?!	37	1	2
391	 I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi.	37	1	2
392	 First	37	1	2
393	 you must learn.	37	1	2
394	 Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?	37	1	2
395	 - Yes. - Will it take three years?	37	1	2
396	 No.	37	1	2
397	 Welcome.	38	1	2
398	 What I am about to tell you must remain between us.	39	1	2
399	 I don't think Bran fell from that tower.	39	1	2
400	 I think he was thrown.	40	1	2
401	 The boy was always sure-footed before.	40	1	2
402	 Someone tried to kill him twice.	40	1	2
403	 Why? Why murder an innocent child?	40	1	2
404	 Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.	40	1	2
405	 - Saw what, my lady? - I don't know.	40	1	2
406	 But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved.	40	1	2
407	 We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.	40	1	2
408	 Did you notice the dagger the killer used?	40	1	2
409	 It's too fine a weapon for such a man.	40	1	2
410	 The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone.	40	1	2
411	 Someone gave it to him.	40	1	2
412	 They come into our home and try to murder my brother?	40	1	2
413	 If it's war they want--	40	1	2
414	 If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you.	40	1	2
415	 What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood?	40	1	2
416	 Huh?	40	1	2
417	 Too easily words of war become acts of war.	40	1	2
418	 We don't know the truth yet.	40	1	2
419	 Lord Stark must be told of this.	40	1	2
420	 I don't trust a raven to carry these words.	41	1	2
421	 - I'll ride to King's Landing. - No.	41	1	2
422	 There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.	41	1	2
423	 - I will go myself. - Mother, you can't.	41	1	2
424	 I must.	41	1	2
425	 I'll send hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.	41	1	2
426	 Too large a party attracts unwanted attention.	41	1	2
427	 I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.	41	1	2
428	 Let me accompany you at least.	41	1	2
429	 The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.	41	1	2
430	 What about Bran?	41	1	2
431	 I have prayed to the seven for more than a month.	41	1	2
432	 Bran's life is in their hands now.	41	1	2
433	 No, Khaleesi.	42	1	2
434	 You must look in his eyes always.	42	1	2
435	 Love comes in at the eyes.	42	1	2
436	 It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man	42	1	2
437	 with nothing but her eyes.	43	1	2
438	 Finish a man?	43	1	2
439	 Oh.	43	1	2
440	 Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia.	43	1	2
441	 Magisters sold their palaces.	43	1	2
442	 Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours.	43	1	2
443	 They say a thousand men proposed to her	43	1	2
444	 and she refused them all.	43	1	2
445	 Well, she sounds like an interesting woman.	43	1	2
446	 I-- I don't think	43	1	2
447	 that Drogo will like it with me on top.	43	1	2
448	 You will make him like it, Khaleesi.	43	1	2
449	 Men want what they've never had.	43	1	2
450	 And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch.	43	1	2
451	 Are you a slave, Khaleesi?	43	1	2
452	 Then don't make love like a slave.	44	1	2
453	 Very good, Khaleesi.	44	1	2
454	 Out there he is the mighty Khal,	44	1	2
455	 but in this tent, he belongs to you.	44	1	2
456	 I-- I don't think	44	1	2
457	 that this is the Dothraki way.	44	1	2
458	 If he wanted the Dothraki way,	44	1	2
459	 why did he marry you?	44	1	2
460	 No.	45	1	2
461	 No!	45	1	2
462	 Ajjalan anha zalat vitiherat yer hatif.	45	1	2
463	 Pardon me, Ser.	47	1	2
464	 Do I frighten you so much, girl?	47	1	2
465	 Or is it him there making you shake?	47	1	2
466	 He frightens me too.	47	1	2
467	 Look at that face.	47	1	2
468	 I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser.	47	1	2
469	 Why won't he speak to me?	48	1	2
470	 He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years.	48	1	2
471	 Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.	48	1	2
472	 He speaks damn well with his sword though.	48	1	2
473	 Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice.	48	1	2
474	 The royal executioner.	48	1	2
475	 What is it, sweet lady?	48	1	2
476	 Does the hound frighten you?	48	1	2
477	 Away with you, dog.	48	1	2
478	 You're scaring my lady.	48	1	2
479	 I don't like to see you upset.	48	1	2
480	 The Sun is finally shining.	48	1	2
481	 Come walk with me.	48	1	2
482	 Stay, lady.	48	1	2
483	 I probably shouldn't have any more.	49	1	2
484	 Father only lets us have one cup at feasts.	49	1	2
485	 My princess can drink as much as she wants.	49	1	2
486	 Don't worry-- you're safe with me.	49	1	2
487	 I'll get you!	49	1	2
488	 - Arya! - Ow!	49	1	2
489	 What are you doing here?	49	1	2
490	 - Go away. - Your sister?	49	1	2
491	 - And who are you, boy? - Mycah, my Lord.	49	1	2
492	 - He the butcher's boy. - He's my friend.	49	1	2
493	 A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh?	49	1	2
494	 Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are.	50	1	2
495	 She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to.	50	1	2
496	 I'm your prince,	50	1	2
497	 not your lord,	50	1	2
498	 and I said pick up your sword.	50	1	2
499	 It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick.	50	1	2
500	 And you're not a Knight.	50	1	2
501	 Only a butcher's boy.	50	1	2
502	 That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?	50	1	2
503	 - Stop it! - Arya, stay out of this.	50	1	2
504	 I won't hurt him...	50	1	2
505	 Much.	50	1	2
506	 Arya!	50	1	2
507	 Filthy little bitch!	50	1	2
508	 No no, stop it, stop it, both of you.	50	1	2
509	 You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!	50	1	2
510	 I'll gut you, you little cunt!	50	1	2
511	 - Arya! - Nymeria!	51	1	2
512	 - Arya! - Nymeria!	51	1	2
513	 No.	51	1	2
514	 No. Please don't.	51	1	2
515	 Arya, leave him alone.	51	1	2
516	 My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you.	51	1	2
517	 Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help.	51	1	2
518	 Then go!	51	1	2
519	 Don't touch me.	51	1	2
520	 The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.	51	1	2
521	 You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey.	52	1	2
522	 Go on-- run.	52	1	2
523	 Go! Leave now!	52	1	2
524	 - It's a direwolf. - I'll check down here.	52	1	2
525	 I think I heard a noise.	52	1	2
526	 Go!	52	1	2
527	 Arya!	52	1	2
528	 - Distant man: Arya! -  Arya!	52	1	2
529	 Arya-aa!	52	1	2
530	 Arya!	52	1	2
531	 Arya!	53	1	2
532	 My lord!	53	1	2
533	 My lord! They found her.	53	1	2
534	 She's unharmed.	53	1	2
535	 Where is she?	53	1	2
536	 She's been taken directly before the King.	53	1	2
537	 - Who took her? - The Lannisters found her.	53	1	2
538	 - Arya-aa! - Right, get back.	53	1	2
539	 The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.	53	1	2
540	 Back! Back to the inn.	53	1	2
541	 All back!	53	1	2
542	 I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.	53	1	2
543	 - Are you hurt? - No.	53	1	2
544	 Oh, it's all right.	53	1	2
545	 What is the meaning of this?	53	1	2
546	 Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?	53	1	2
547	 How dare you speak to your King in that manner?	53	1	2
548	 Quiet, woman.	53	1	2
549	 Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl.	53	1	2
550	 But we need to get this business done quickly.	53	1	2
551	 Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son.	53	1	2
552	 That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.	54	1	2
553	 That's not true!	54	1	2
554	 She just... Bit him a little.	54	1	2
555	 - He was hurting Mycah. - Joff told us what happened.	54	1	2
556	 You and that boy beat him with clubs	54	1	2
557	 - while you set your wolf on him. - That's not what happened!	54	1	2
558	 Yes it is!	54	1	2
559	 They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.	54	1	2
560	 - Liar! - Shut up!	54	1	2
561	 Enough!	54	1	2
562	 He tells me one thing, she tells me another.	54	1	2
563	 Seven hells! What am I to make of this?	54	1	2
564	 Where's your other daughter, Ned?	54	1	2
565	 In bed asleep.	54	1	2
566	 She's not.	54	1	2
567	 Sansa, come here, darling.	54	1	2
568	 Now, child...	54	1	2
569	 Tell me what happened.	54	1	2
570	 Tell it all and tell it true.	54	1	2
571	 It's a great crime to lie to a King.	55	1	2
572	 I don't know.	55	1	2
573	 I don't remember. Everything happened so fast.	55	1	2
574	 - I didn't see. - Liar!	55	1	2
575	 - Liar liar liar! - Arya!	55	1	2
576	 - Hey, stop it! That's enough of that. - Liar liar liar!	55	1	2
577	 - Stop! Arya! - She's as wild as that animal of hers.	55	1	2
578	 I want her punished.	55	1	2
579	 What would you have me do, whip her through the streets?	55	1	2
580	 Damn it, children fight. It's over.	55	1	2
581	 Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.	55	1	2
582	 You let that little girl disarm you?	55	1	2
583	 Ned, see to it that your daughter is disciplined.	55	1	2
584	 - I'll do the same with my son. - Gladly, your Grace.	55	1	2
585	 And what of the direwolf?	56	1	2
586	 What of the beast that savaged your son?	56	1	2
587	 I'd forgot the damned wolf.	56	1	2
588	 We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace.	56	1	2
589	 No? So be it.	56	1	2
590	 We have another wolf.	56	1	2
591	 As you will.	56	1	2
592	 - You can't mean it. - A direwolf's no pet.	56	1	2
593	 Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.	56	1	2
594	 He doesn't mean Lady, does he?	56	1	2
595	 No no, not lady! Lady didn't bite anyone!	56	1	2
596	 - She's good! - Lady wasn't there!	56	1	2
597	 - You leave her alone! - Stop them. Don't let them do it.	56	1	2
598	 Please please, it wasn't Lady!	56	1	2
599	 Is this your command--	56	1	2
600	 your Grace?	56	1	2
601	 - Where is the beast? - Chained up outside, your Grace.	57	1	2
602	 Ser Ilyn, do me the honor.	57	1	2
603	 No.	57	1	2
604	 Jory...	57	1	2
605	 Take the girls to their rooms.	57	1	2
606	 If it must be done,	57	1	2
607	 then I'll do it myself.	57	1	2
608	 Is this some trick?	57	1	2
609	 The wolf is of the north.	57	1	2
610	 She deserves better than a butcher.	57	1	2
611	 The butcher's boy--	58	1	2
612	 you rode him down?	58	1	2
613	 He ran...	58	1	2
614	 Not very fast.	58	1	2
615		59	1	2
616		0	1	2
0		1	6	2
1	 Give him another go, Ned.	2	6	2
2	 That's my father.	3	6	2
3	 And my Uncle Benjen.	3	6	2
4	 Keep your shield up or I'll ring your head like a bell.	3	6	2
5	 They were all so happy.	3	6	2
6	 So were you once.	3	6	2
7	 Stop showing off.	3	6	2
8	 Lyanna!	3	6	2
9	 My Aunt Lyanna.	3	6	2
10	 I've seen her statue in the crypt.	3	6	2
11	 My father never talked about her.	3	6	2
12	 Would you get out of here? We're sparring.	3	6	2
13	 Who are you gonna spar with when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?	3	6	2
14	 I don't know.	3	6	2
15	 What about him?	4	6	2
16	 Wylis, come here.	4	6	2
17	 Hodor?	4	6	2
18	 But he's got giant's blood.	4	6	2
19	 And you've got training. Sounds like a fair match to me.	4	6	2
20	 Benjen always lifts his chin when he's about to charge.	4	6	2
21	 And lowers it when he's going to dodge, my lady.	4	6	2
22	 Hodor talks?	4	6	2
23	 You leave the fighting to the little lords, Wylis.	4	6	2
24	 Come along, now. It's no place for you.	4	6	2
25	 Oh, Nan, look at the size of him.	4	6	2
26	 If he ever learned to fight, he'd be unstoppable.	4	6	2
27	 Well, he's never going to learn to fight because he's a stable boy.	4	6	2
28	 So leave him be.	4	6	2
29	 It is time to go.	4	6	2
30	 Please, a little longer.	4	6	2
31	 You finally show me something I care about	5	6	2
32	 and then you drag me away.	5	6	2
33	 It is beautiful beneath the sea,	5	6	2
34	 but if you stay too long, you'll drown.	5	6	2
35	 I wasn't drowning. I was home.	5	6	2
36	 Wylis.	5	6	2
37	 Hodor.	5	6	2
38	 I saw you as a boy.	5	6	2
39	 You could talk.	5	6	2
40	 What happened?	5	6	2
41	 Hodor.	5	6	2
42	 Where's Meera?	6	6	2
43	 Hodor.	6	6	2
44	 You shouldn't be here.	6	6	2
45	 It's not safe outside the cave.	6	6	2
46	 It's not safe anywhere.	6	6	2
47	 I saw that Hodor wasn't always Hodor.	6	6	2
48	 - Hodor. - His real name is Wylis.	6	6	2
49	 And he could talk and fight and-- and then--	6	6	2
50	 What's wrong?	7	6	2
51	 The Three-Eyed Raven says there's a war coming.	7	6	2
52	 And we're going to fight it in there?	7	6	2
53	 Brandon Stark needs you.	7	6	2
54	 For what? I sit in there	7	6	2
55	 and I watch him have his visions and nothing ever happens.	7	6	2
56	 He isn't going to stay here forever.	7	6	2
57	 And out there he needs you.	7	6	2
58	 It's time, Ser Davos.	8	6	2
59	 Open the door and the men inside	8	6	2
60	 can rejoin their brothers in peace.	8	6	2
61	 We'll even set the wolf free north of the Wall where it belongs.	8	6	2
62	 Nobody needs to die tonight.	8	6	2
63	 I've never been much of a fighter.	8	6	2
64	 Apologies for what you're about to see.	9	6	2
65	 Come on.	9	6	2
66	 Attack!	10	6	2
67	 Fight, you cowards!	10	6	2
68	 You fucking traitor.	11	6	2
69	 The only traitors here are the ones	11	6	2
70	 who shoved their knives into their Lord Commander's heart.	11	6	2
71	 For thousands of years the Night's Watch	11	6	2
72	 has held Castle Black against the wildlings.	11	6	2
73	 Until you.	11	6	2
74	 Throw them into the cells where they belong.	11	6	2
75	 Took a lot of knives.	12	6	2
76	 I'll have my men get the wood for a fire.	12	6	2
77	 Bodies to burn.	12	6	2
78	 Shh, hey.	12	6	2
79	 Right, so there she is, high and mighty Queen Cersei,	12	6	2
80	 tits and ass jiggling in the breeze.	12	6	2
81	 All of a sudden she looks my way.	12	6	2
82	" Gives me a little smile like, ""Well?"""	12	6	2
83	 So, all right, you know, I've never been shy	12	6	2
84	 and I'm blessed down south, so I put it right out.	12	6	2
85	 She's never seen anything like it.	12	6	2
86	 I mean, she's used to her brother and from what I hear,	12	6	2
87	 Jaime Lannister's half an inch shy of an inch.	13	6	2
88	 Ooh!	13	6	2
89	 She sees it and I swear to the gods she licks her lips.	13	6	2
90	 Well, you all know me.	13	6	2
91	 You know I wouldn't lie about this.	13	6	2
92	 Get out of my way.	14	6	2
93	 King's orders, Your Grace.	14	6	2
94	 What are the king's orders?	14	6	2
95	 He would like you to remain in the Red Keep, Your Grace,	14	6	2
96	 for your own protection.	14	6	2
97	 You're barring me from attending my own daughter's funeral?	14	6	2
98	 Forgive me, Your Grace, by the king's command, I cannot let you pass.	15	6	2
99	 I would like to speak to my son.	15	6	2
100	 He has left the Red Keep, Your Grace.	15	6	2
101	 She grew up.	15	6	2
102	 Almost.	15	6	2
103	 Have we caught Prince Trystane's killers?	15	6	2
104	 I expect it was Mother.	15	6	2
105	 Your mother wouldn't do that.	15	6	2
106	 Yes, she would.	16	6	2
107	 Are you angry with her?	16	6	2
108	 - Of course not. - Then why didn't you let her come?	16	6	2
109	 She has every right to be here.	16	6	2
110	 They told me she wouldn't be allowed in the sept.	16	6	2
111	 If she had tried--	16	6	2
112	 They're not putting your mother in a cell ever again.	16	6	2
113	 Not while I'm here.	16	6	2
114	 Why haven't you gone to see her?	16	6	2
115	 Everything she endured, she did it for you.	16	6	2
116	 Don't you think I know that?	16	6	2
117	 I'm sorry.	16	6	2
118	 But I can't.	16	6	2
119	 Why not?	16	6	2
120	 When the Faith Militant seized her and Margaery,	16	6	2
121	 what did I do?	17	6	2
122	 When they paraded her through the streets like a whore,	17	6	2
123	 what did I do?	17	6	2
124	 We all fail sometimes.	17	6	2
125	 The king is supposed to be the Protector of the Realm.	17	6	2
126	 If I can't even protect my own wife or my own mother,	17	6	2
127	 what good am I?	17	6	2
128	 Go and see your mother and ask her to forgive you.	17	6	2
129	 Your Grace.	17	6	2
130	 Lord Commander.	17	6	2
131	 I want to see my wife.	17	6	2
132	 The gods wait for Queen Margaery	17	6	2
133	 to confess her crimes and seek their mercy.	17	6	2
134	 The king must wait as well.	17	6	2
135	 Go and see your mother, Tommen.	17	6	2
136	 You're a bold man.	18	6	2
137	 On the contrary.	18	6	2
138	 I fear a great deal.	18	6	2
139	 The Father, the Mother,	18	6	2
140	 the Warrior.	18	6	2
141	 Do you know why we use these stones?	18	6	2
142	 To remind us not to fear death.	18	6	2
143	 We close our eyes on this world and open them on the next.	18	6	2
144	 You must long for the next life.	18	6	2
145	 In truth, I fear that, too.	18	6	2
146	 You imprisoned and humiliated my sister.	18	6	2
147	 Your sister sought the gods' mercy	18	6	2
148	 and atoned for her sin.	18	6	2
149	 What about my sins?	18	6	2
150	 I broke a sacred oath and stabbed my king in the back.	19	6	2
151	 I killed my own cousin.	19	6	2
152	 When the gods judged my brother guilty,	19	6	2
153	 I helped him escape their justice.	19	6	2
154	 What atonement do I deserve?	19	6	2
155	 You would spill blood in this holy place?	19	6	2
156	 Oh, the gods won't mind.	19	6	2
157	 They've spilled more blood than the rest of us combined.	19	6	2
158	 Go on, then.	19	6	2
159	 I deserve it. We all do.	19	6	2
160	 We are weak, vain creatures.	19	6	2
161	 We live only by the Mother's mercy.	19	6	2
162	 They should be closer if you mean for them to save you.	20	6	2
163	 I don't.	20	6	2
164	 They'd never reach me before you struck.	20	6	2
165	 I've fought against worse odds.	20	6	2
166	 No doubt many of us would fall.	20	6	2
167	 But who are we, hmm?	20	6	2
168	 We have no names, no family.	20	6	2
169	 Every one of us is poor and powerless.	20	6	2
170	 And yet together,	20	6	2
171	 we can overthrow an empire.	20	6	2
172	 Mother.	21	6	2
173	 Did they put her in the red gown or the gold?	21	6	2
174	 Gold.	21	6	2
175	 Good. It was always her color.	21	6	2
176	 I'm sorry for keeping you here.	21	6	2
177	 I shouldn't have, but I was--	21	6	2
178	 I didn't want to lose you again.	21	6	2
179	 I understand.	21	6	2
180	 I'm glad to see you.	21	6	2
181	 I know I should have come sooner.	21	6	2
182	 I wanted to. I was wrong.	22	6	2
183	 It's all right.	22	6	2
184	 No, it isn't.	22	6	2
185	 I should have executed all of them.	22	6	2
186	 I should have pulled down the sept	22	6	2
187	 onto the High Sparrow's head before I let them do that to you,	22	6	2
188	 as you would have for me.	22	6	2
189	 You raised me to be strong...	22	6	2
190	 and I wasn't.	22	6	2
191	 But I want to be.	22	6	2
192	 Help me.	22	6	2
193	 Always.	22	6	2
194	 If I lost my cock, I'd drink all the time.	23	6	2
195	 Meaning no offense.	23	6	2
196	 He makes dwarf jokes, I make eunuch jokes.	23	6	2
197	 I do not make dwarf jokes.	23	6	2
198	 You think them.	23	6	2
199	 So, the fleet. It's been burned.	23	6	2
200	 We are searching for the men who burned the ships, but nobody saw anything.	23	6	2
201	 Surely there's some good news lurking somewhere.	23	6	2
202	 Astapor and Yunkai have stopped asking us for aid.	23	6	2
203	 Perhaps they can tell us their secret.	23	6	2
204	 The Masters have retaken both cities.	24	6	2
205	 Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver's Bay has returned to the slavers.	24	6	2
206	 What about the dragons? We have two of them here beneath the pyramid.	24	6	2
207	 They are not eating.	24	6	2
208	 They haven't touched any food since Queen Daenerys left.	24	6	2
209	 Daenerys is the dragon queen.	24	6	2
210	 Can't very well let the dragons starve, that's obvious.	24	6	2
211	 If a dragon does not want to eat, how do you force him to eat?	24	6	2
212	 Dragons do not do well in captivity.	24	6	2
213	 - How do you know this? - That's what I do.	24	6	2
214	 I drink and I know things.	24	6	2
215	 The dragons Aegon used to conquer Westeros	24	6	2
216	 ranged over hundreds of miles.	24	6	2
217	 Then Daenerys's ancestors	24	6	2
218	 started chaining them up in pens.	24	6	2
219	 A few generations later,	24	6	2
220	 the last dragons were no larger than cats.	24	6	2
221	 They must be unchained or they'll waste away.	25	6	2
222	 Missandei,	25	6	2
223	 how many times were you in the company of these dragons?	25	6	2
224	 - Many times. - And did they ever harm you?	25	6	2
225	 Never.	25	6	2
226	 Dragons are intelligent.	25	6	2
227	 More intelligent than men according to some maesters.	25	6	2
228	 They have affection for their friends	25	6	2
229	 and fury for their enemies.	25	6	2
230	 - I am their friend. - Do they know that?	25	6	2
231	 They will. It's time they had their supper.	25	6	2
232	 I'm friends with your mother.	27	6	2
233	 I'm here to help.	27	6	2
234	 Don't eat the help.	27	6	2
235	 When I was a child,	27	6	2
236	 an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day.	27	6	2
237	 I begged him for one of you.	27	6	2
238	" ""It wouldn't even have to be a big dragon,"" I told him."	27	6	2
239	" ""It could be little like me."""	27	6	2
240	 Everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard.	28	6	2
241	 Then my father told me	28	6	2
242	 the last dragon had died a century ago.	28	6	2
243	 I cried myself to sleep that night.	28	6	2
244	 But here you are.	28	6	2
245	 Next time I have an idea like that,	29	6	2
246	 punch me in the face.	29	6	2
247	 What's your name?	30	6	2
248	 What's your name?	30	6	2
249	 - No one. - I don't believe that.	30	6	2
250	 You don't believe that.	30	6	2
251	 Who are you?	30	6	2
252	 No one.	31	6	2
253	 If a girl says her name,	31	6	2
254	 a man will let her sleep under a roof tonight.	31	6	2
255	 A girl has no name.	31	6	2
256	 If a girl says her name,	31	6	2
257	 a man will feed her tonight.	31	6	2
258	 A girl has no name.	31	6	2
259	 If a girl says her name,	31	6	2
260	 a man will give her eyes back.	31	6	2
261	 A girl has no name.	31	6	2
262	 Come.	31	6	2
263	 Leave it.	31	6	2
264	 A girl is not a beggar anymore.	31	6	2
265	 We came upon the bodies on our way here.	32	6	2
266	 Half a dozen men? Your best hunters?	32	6	2
267	 They obviously had help.	32	6	2
268	 I didn't think Lady Sansa killed them all by herself.	32	6	2
269	 Thank you for this report, Lord Karstark.	32	6	2
270	 We know where she's going.	32	6	2
271	 Her brother's at Castle Black.	32	6	2
272	 Ned Stark's last surviving son?	32	6	2
273	 Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark.	32	6	2
274	 So was I, Father.	32	6	2
275	 Your hold on the North will never be secure	32	6	2
276	 as long as a Stark can walk through that door.	32	6	2
277	 Castle Black isn't defended on the southern side.	32	6	2
278	 And the few men left are barely men at all. Farm boys and thieves.	32	6	2
279	 With a small force, we could storm the castle, kill Jon Snow--	32	6	2
280	 Murder the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?	32	6	2
281	 You'd unite every house in the North against us.	32	6	2
282	 We don't need every house in the North.	33	6	2
283	 The Umbers, the Manderlys, and the Karstarks	33	6	2
284	 command more soldiers than all the other houses combined.	33	6	2
285	 With their support, none could challenge us.	33	6	2
286	 The Starks lost my house the day King Robb cut off my father's head.	33	6	2
287	 It's time for new blood in the North.	33	6	2
288	 If you acquire a reputation as a mad dog,	33	6	2
289	 you'll be treated as a mad dog.	33	6	2
290	 Taken out back and slaughtered for pig feed.	33	6	2
291	 My lords.	33	6	2
292	 Lady Walda has given birth.	33	6	2
293	 A boy.	33	6	2
294	 Red-cheeked and healthy.	33	6	2
295	 My congratulations, Lord Bolton.	33	6	2
296	 Congratulations, Father.	34	6	2
297	 I look forward to meeting my new brother.	34	6	2
298	 You'll always be my firstborn.	34	6	2
299	 Thank you for saying that.	34	6	2
300	 It means a great deal to me.	34	6	2
301	 Maester Wolkan,	35	6	2
302	 send ravens to all the northern houses. Roose Bolton is dead.	35	6	2
303	 Poisoned by our enemies.	35	6	2
304	 How did he die?	35	6	2
305	 Poisoned by his enemies.	35	6	2
306	 You're talking to your lord. Use respect.	35	6	2
307	 Forgive me, my lord.	35	6	2
308	 Send for Lady Walda and the baby.	35	6	2
309	 She's resting, my lord.	35	6	2
310	 At once, my lord.	35	6	2
311	 There he is.	36	6	2
312	 Isn't he wonderful?	36	6	2
313	 May I hold him?	36	6	2
314	 Of-- of course.	36	6	2
315	 Little brother.	36	6	2
316	 Lord Bolton sent for us.	36	6	2
317	 Have you seen him?	36	6	2
318	 Of course. Follow me, Mother.	37	6	2
319	 Where is Lord Bolton?	37	6	2
320	 Down!	37	6	2
321	 It's all right. Come on, shh.	37	6	2
322	 It's cold out here, Ramsay. I need to feed him.	37	6	2
323	 Ramsay, where is your father?	38	6	2
324	 Ramsay.	38	6	2
325	 Where is Lord Bolton?	38	6	2
326	 I am Lord Bolton.	38	6	2
327	 Ramsay.	38	6	2
328	 Ramsay, please.	38	6	2
329	 I'll leave Winterfell. I'll go back to the Riverlands.	38	6	2
330	 Please.	38	6	2
331	 Ramsay.	38	6	2
332	 He's your brother.	39	6	2
333	 I prefer being an only child.	39	6	2
334	 I saw her with a man.	39	6	2
335	 I don't think he hurt her.	39	6	2
336	 She didn't want to leave him, he didn't want to leave her.	39	6	2
337	 You don't know which way she went?	39	6	2
338	 I spent three days looking for her.	39	6	2
339	 She disappeared.	39	6	2
340	 How'd she look?	39	6	2
341	 She looked good.	39	6	2
342	 She wasn't exactly dressed like a lady.	39	6	2
343	 No, she wouldn't be.	40	6	2
344	 What happened at Winterfell?	40	6	2
345	 I should have gone with you while I had the chance.	40	6	2
346	 It was a difficult choice, my lady.	40	6	2
347	 We've all had to make difficult choices.	40	6	2
348	 We shouldn't be lighting fires.	40	6	2
349	 It's not safe.	41	6	2
350	 He won't stop hunting us.	41	6	2
351	 We just have to make it to Castle Black.	41	6	2
352	 Once we're with Jon, Ramsay won't be able to touch us.	41	6	2
353	 Jon will have me killed the moment I step through the gate.	41	6	2
354	 I won't let him.	41	6	2
355	 I'll tell him the truth about Bran and Rickon.	41	6	2
356	 And the truth about the farm boys I killed in their place.	41	6	2
357	 And the truth about Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded.	41	6	2
358	 And the truth about Robb, who I betrayed.	41	6	2
359	 When you take the black, all your crimes are forgiven.	41	6	2
360	 I don't want to be forgiven.	41	6	2
361	 I can never make amends to your family	41	6	2
362	 for the things I've done.	41	6	2
363	 They'll keep you safer than I ever could.	41	6	2
364	 You're not coming with us?	41	6	2
365	 I would have taken you all the way to the Wall.	42	6	2
366	 I would have died to get you there.	42	6	2
367	 May I take one of the horses?	42	6	2
368	 Where will you go?	42	6	2
369	 Home.	42	6	2
370	 The Glovers have retaken Deepwood Motte.	42	6	2
371	 And the ironborn who held it?	42	6	2
372	 They died fighting to a man.	42	6	2
373	 What is dead may never die.	43	6	2
374	 What is dead may never die.	43	6	2
375	 But they did	43	6	2
376	 and our invasion died with them.	43	6	2
377	 Deepwood Motte was our last stronghold on the mainland.	43	6	2
378	 Then we will take more.	43	6	2
379	 Why? For more pinecones and rocks?	43	6	2
380	 Because I order it.	43	6	2
381	 We can defeat anyone at sea,	43	6	2
382	 but we'll never hold lands and castles	43	6	2
383	 against mainland armies.	43	6	2
384	 Not if our captains defy my orders,	43	6	2
385	 abandon their posts, and sacrifice our men on foolish missions.	43	6	2
386	 I won't apologize for trying to rescue Theon.	43	6	2
387	 Then where is he?	43	6	2
388	 Where is your kingdom?	43	6	2
389	 We took those castles because the northerners marched off to war.	43	6	2
390	 That war is over.	43	6	2
391	 The last time we provoked them too far,	43	6	2
392	 I watched from that window as they breached our walls	43	6	2
393	 and knocked down our towers.	44	6	2
394	 I lost two brothers that day.	44	6	2
395	 And I lost three sons.	44	6	2
396	 The War of the Five Kings, they call it.	44	6	2
397	 Well, the other four are dead.	44	6	2
398	 When you rule the Iron Islands, you can wage all the peace you want.	44	6	2
399	 But for now, shut your mouth and obey	44	6	2
400	 or I will make another heir who will.	44	6	2
401	 Let me pass.	45	6	2
402	 You fool, move aside for your king.	45	6	2
403	 Haven't I always, brother?	45	6	2
404	 I thought you'd be rotting under some foreign sea by now.	45	6	2
405	 What is dead may never die.	45	6	2
406	 Has the custom changed since I've been gone?	45	6	2
407	 Aren't you supposed to repeat the words?	45	6	2
408	 You can mock our god without my help.	45	6	2
409	 I don't mock the Drowned God.	45	6	2
410	 I am the Drowned God.	45	6	2
411	 From Oldtown to Qarth,	45	6	2
412	 when men see my sails, they pray.	45	6	2
413	 You're old, brother.	46	6	2
414	 You've had your time.	46	6	2
415	 Now let another rule.	46	6	2
416	 I heard you lost your mind	46	6	2
417	 during a storm on the Jade Sea.	46	6	2
418	 They tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard.	46	6	2
419	 They did.	46	6	2
420	 And when the storm passed, you cut out their tongues.	46	6	2
421	 I needed silence.	46	6	2
422	 What kind of an ironborn	46	6	2
423	 loses his senses during a storm?	46	6	2
424	 I am the storm, brother.	46	6	2
425	 The first storm and the last.	46	6	2
426	 And you're in my way.	47	6	2
427	 Lord, take your servant Balon back beneath the waves.	47	6	2
428	 Feed the creatures of your kingdom on his flesh.	47	6	2
429	 Pull his bones down to your depths	47	6	2
430	 to rest beside his ancestors and his children.	47	6	2
431	 What is dead may never die.	48	6	2
432	 I'm going to find out who did this.	48	6	2
433	 I'm going to feed them to the sharks while they live.	48	6	2
434	 I swear it by the Salt Throne.	48	6	2
435	 The Salt Throne is not yours to swear upon,	48	6	2
436	 not unless the kingsmoot chooses you.	48	6	2
437	 My father would have wanted me to rule.	48	6	2
438	 Your father does not get to choose. The law is clear.	48	6	2
439	 Perhaps you'll win.	48	6	2
440	 Perhaps you'll be the first woman in history to rule the ironborn.	48	6	2
441	 And perhaps not.	48	6	2
442	 Come in.	49	6	2
443	 I'm sorry, my lady. Didn't mean to interrupt.	49	6	2
444	 You interrupt nothing.	49	6	2
445	 I assume you know why I'm here.	49	6	2
446	 I will after you tell me.	49	6	2
447	 It's about the Lord Commander.	49	6	2
448	 The former Lord Commander.	49	6	2
449	 Does he have to be?	49	6	2
450	 What are you asking?	49	6	2
451	 Do you know of any magic...	50	6	2
452	 that could help him?	50	6	2
453	 Bring him back?	50	6	2
454	 If you want to help him, leave him be.	50	6	2
455	 Can it be done?	50	6	2
456	 There are some with this power.	50	6	2
457	 - How? - I don't know.	50	6	2
458	 Have you seen it done?	50	6	2
459	 I met a man who came back from the dead,	50	6	2
460	 but the priest who did it--	50	6	2
461	 it shouldn't have been possible.	50	6	2
462	 But it was. It could be now.	50	6	2
463	 Not for me.	50	6	2
464	 Not for you?	50	6	2
465	 I saw you drink poison that should have killed you.	50	6	2
466	 I saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows.	50	6	2
467	 Everything I believed,	51	6	2
468	 the great victory I saw in the flames,	51	6	2
469	 all of it was a lie.	51	6	2
470	 You were right all along.	51	6	2
471	 The Lord never spoke to me.	51	6	2
472	 Fuck him, then.	51	6	2
473	 Fuck all of them.	51	6	2
474	 I'm not a devout man, obviously.	51	6	2
475	 Seven gods, drowned gods, tree gods, it's all the same.	51	6	2
476	 I'm not asking the Lord of Light for help.	51	6	2
477	 I'm asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist.	51	6	2
478	 I never had this gift.	51	6	2
479	 Have you ever tried?	51	6	2
480	 Please.	56	6	2
481		58	6	2
482		0	6	2
0	 What was she like?	2	4	9
1	 She...	2	4	9
2	 She had red hair.	3	4	9
3	 Oh?	3	4	9
4	 - How big were her feet? - What do you want me to say?	3	4	9
5	 I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone.	3	4	9
6	 To be with someone.	3	4	9
7	 To love someone and have them love you back.	3	4	9
8	 We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned.	3	4	9
9	 You're the closest I'll ever get to knowing.	3	4	9
10	 So you and Gilly never?	3	4	9
11	 No.	3	4	9
12	 She just had a baby.	3	4	9
13	 And she never offered.	3	4	9
14	 But if she had,	3	4	9
15	 you would have?	3	4	9
16	 You'd have broken your vows?	3	4	9
17	 The interesting thing is,	4	4	9
18	 our vows never specifically forbid	4	4	9
19	 intimate relations with women.	4	4	9
20	 What?	4	4	9
21	" ""I shall take no wife,"" yes, that's in there. There's no denying that."	4	4	9
22	" ""I shall father no children."" It's very specific."	4	4	9
23	 But what do our vows have to say about other	4	4	9
24	 activities is open to interpretation.	4	4	9
25	 I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.	4	4	9
26	 Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret.	4	4	9
27	 We didn't.	4	4	9
28	 So what's it like?	4	4	9
29	 It's...	4	4	9
30	 there's this person, this whole other person.	5	4	9
31	 And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you.	5	4	9
32	 And you...	5	4	9
33	 for a little...	5	4	9
34	 for a little while, you're more than just you.	5	4	9
35	 You're... I don't know. I'm not a bleeding poet.	5	4	9
36	 No, you're really not.	5	4	9
37	 What did I get for it?	5	4	9
38	 An arrow six inches from my heart.	5	4	9
39	 There'll be arrows for all of us soon, I imagine.	5	4	9
40	 There will.	5	4	9
41	 They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.	5	4	9
42	 Go get some sleep, Sam.	5	4	9
43	 I'll take this watch.	5	4	9
44	 Did I ever tell you about her?	6	4	9
45	 - My Sheila? - Yes.	6	4	9
46	 That was a night to remember.	6	4	9
47	 Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink.	6	4	9
48	 Her fangs were sharp,	6	4	9
49	 but she knew how to use them.	6	4	9
50	 And she was nice and soft down below.	7	4	9
51	 No, she was no ordinary beast.	7	4	9
52	 Many is the man who...	7	4	9
53	 I know you never fucked a bear.	7	4	9
54	 You know you never fucked a bear.	7	4	9
55	 Right now I don't want to think about the bear you never fucked.	7	4	9
56	 Right now all I want to think about	7	4	9
57	 is each one of these arrows finding its way into a crow's heart.	7	4	9
58	 We could be waiting here a while.	7	4	9
59	 Good.	7	4	9
60	 The longer we wait, the more arrows I'll have.	7	4	9
61	 But they came up here to our land	7	4	9
62	 and put up a big wall and said it was theirs.	7	4	9
63	 Then they started hunting us down.	7	4	9
64	 This time, we're the ones doing the hunting.	7	4	9
65	 You've got a lot to say about killing.	8	4	9
66	 Even more words than arrows.	8	4	9
67	 Back in those villages, I killed just as many of them as you did.	8	4	9
68	 More, I reckon.	8	4	9
69	 Yes, but none of those were your crow lover.	8	4	9
70	 I probably killed him already.	8	4	9
71	 So you've said.	8	4	9
72	 And if not,	8	4	9
73	 the only thing left of him is gonna be his fun bits hanging around my neck.	8	4	9
74	 More words.	8	4	9
75	 Know what I think you do when you see him?	8	4	9
76	 Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.	8	4	9
77	 What, you've been thinking about that ginger minge?	8	4	9
78	 Wondering what I taste like?	8	4	9
79	 Maybe I have.	8	4	9
80	 Jon Snow is mine.	8	4	9
81	 Anyone else tries to kill him,	9	4	9
82	 I'll have an arrow for them.	9	4	9
83	 And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me.	9	4	9
84	 And what is it that couldn't wait until morning, Tarly?	9	4	9
85	 Maester Aemon.	9	4	9
86	 - How did you know... - That it was you?	9	4	9
87	 Who else but Samwell Tarly	9	4	9
88	 would be wasting candles	9	4	9
89	 to read in the middle of the night?	9	4	9
90	 - Let me help you. - Oh, no need.	10	4	9
91	 I know my way around this library	10	4	9
92	 better than any other place in Castle Black.	10	4	9
93	 Thousands of books	10	4	9
94	 and no eyes to read them.	10	4	9
95	 Old age is a wonderful source of ironies...	10	4	9
96	 ...if nothing else.	10	4	9
97	 But you didn't answer my question.	10	4	9
98	 What are you reading?	10	4	9
99	 Maester Faull.	10	4	9
100	 Ah, the wildlings.	10	4	9
101	 I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull	10	4	9
102	 ever got to a wildling was this very library.	10	4	9
103	 But what he says about what they do,	10	4	9
104	 it's all true.	10	4	9
105	 It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.	10	4	9
106	 Yes, imagine the stories wildlings tell about us.	10	4	9
107	 Love is the death of duty.	11	4	9
108	 I told that to your friend Jon Snow once.	11	4	9
109	 He didn't listen and neither did you.	11	4	9
110	 Which is why you've abandoned your watch atop the Wall...	11	4	9
111	 to come here and read about the terrible things	11	4	9
112	 that may have happened to the girl you love.	11	4	9
113	 I don't... love her.	11	4	9
114	 - Yes, you do. - No.	11	4	9
115	 Yes, you do.	11	4	9
116	 Heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me.	11	4	9
117	 I remember how it sounds.	11	4	9
118	 I was in love once.	11	4	9
119	 You were?	11	4	9
120	 You can imagine all manner of horrors	11	4	9
121	 befalling that poor girl and her child.	12	4	9
122	 Is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once,	12	4	9
123	 more or less, like you?	12	4	9
124	 I'm sorry, Maester.	12	4	9
125	 I didn't mean it like that.	12	4	9
126	 Do you know who I was before I came here?	12	4	9
127	 What I could have been here if I'd only said the word?	12	4	9
128	 Of course you do.	12	4	9
129	 I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen.	12	4	9
130	 A future king always does.	12	4	9
131	 Some of them were quite forward	12	4	9
132	 in their attempts to win my affections.	12	4	9
133	 One of them succeeded.	12	4	9
134	 I was very young.	12	4	9
135	 Who was she?	12	4	9
136	 Ah.	12	4	9
137	 I could tell you everything about her.	13	4	9
138	 Who she was,	13	4	9
139	 how we met,	13	4	9
140	 the color of her eyes,	13	4	9
141	 and the shape of her nose.	13	4	9
142	 I can see her...	13	4	9
143	 right in front of me.	13	4	9
144	 She's more real than you are.	13	4	9
145	 We could spend all night trading tales of lost loves.	13	4	9
146	 Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit	13	4	9
147	 than the prospect of imminent death.	13	4	9
148	 Go to bed, Tarly.	13	4	9
149	  Sorry, I can't open the gate for anybody. Orders.	13	4	9
150	  You don't understand. They killed everyone.	13	4	9
151	 Everyone but me and my baby.	14	4	9
152	 They're out there. I saw them on my way here.	14	4	9
153	 They may have seen me. They may have followed me. Please.	14	4	9
154	 I'm sorry, I can't.	14	4	9
155	  If they find us out here, you don't know...	14	4	9
156	 Pyp! Open the gate.	14	4	9
157	 - I can't. - Sam, is that you?	14	4	9
158	 Yes.	14	4	9
159	 Thorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate.	14	4	9
160	 Oh, Pyp, open the fucking gate!	14	4	9
161	 I never heard you curse before.	14	4	9
162	 Yes, well, best get used to it.	14	4	9
163	 Are you all right?	14	4	9
164	 Shh, you're all right.	14	4	9
165	 Yeah. Of course you are, my brave little fella.	14	4	9
166	 - It was horrible. - I'm so, so sorry.	14	4	9
167	 I didn't know until I got back.	14	4	9
168	 Don't let them send me away, Sam.	14	4	9
169	 - Never. - I know there's no women allowed.	14	4	9
170	 Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me.	15	4	9
171	 From now on, wherever you go,	15	4	9
172	 I go, too.	15	4	9
173	 Get ready!	15	4	9
174	 -  Open the gate! -  Ready yourselves!	15	4	9
175	 Make haste!	15	4	9
176	 -  Prepare! -  Up on the Wall!	15	4	9
177	 Quickly! Up! Up!	15	4	9
178	 How many? How many are there?	15	4	9
179	 Beyond the trees!	15	4	9
180	 It's time.	15	4	9
181	 Light them up! Light them all!	16	4	9
182	 Move!	17	4	9
183	 Pick up the pace!	17	4	9
184	 Come on, come on.	17	4	9
185	 Here we go, boys, there's one.	17	4	9
186	 Let's go. There's two.	17	4	9
187	 Let's get the next load.	17	4	9
188	 That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser.	17	4	9
189	 100,000 you say?	17	4	9
190	 Yes, Ser.	17	4	9
191	 You can say it if you like.	17	4	9
192	 We should have sealed the tunnel while we had the chance,	17	4	9
193	 like you suggested.	17	4	9
194	 It was a difficult decision either way, Ser.	18	4	9
195	 Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow?	18	4	9
196	 It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed	18	4	9
197	 by every clever little twat with a mouth.	18	4	9
198	 But if he starts second-guessing himself,	18	4	9
199	 that's the end...	18	4	9
200	 for him, for the clever little twats,	18	4	9
201	 for everyone.	18	4	9
202	 This is not the end. Not for us.	18	4	9
203	 Not if you lot do your duty	18	4	9
204	 for however long it takes to beat them back.	18	4	9
205	 And then you get to go on hating me	18	4	9
206	 and I get to go on wishing	18	4	9
207	 your wildling whore had finished the job.	18	4	9
208	 You'll be safe down here.	19	4	9
209	 I'll check on you as soon as I can.	19	4	9
210	 You're leaving me again?	19	4	9
211	 I'm not leaving you.	19	4	9
212	 You're going up there and we're staying down here. That's leaving.	19	4	9
213	 You said from now on we'd stay together.	19	4	9
214	 I... I didn't mean in the same room.	19	4	9
215	 What are you going to do out there?	19	4	9
216	 - Help my brothers. - How?	19	4	9
217	 You're going to fight the free folk when they come?	19	4	9
218	 They'll kill you. In Mole's Town, they killed everyone.	19	4	9
219	 I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.	19	4	9
220	 Why not? You won't matter up there.	19	4	9
221	 You will down here.	19	4	9
222	 I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly.	20	4	9
223	 I made a promise to defend the Wall	20	4	9
224	 and I have to keep it...	20	4	9
225	 because that's what men do.	20	4	9
226	 Promise me you won't die.	20	4	9
227	 I promise you I won't die.	20	4	9
228	 There's a lot more wildlings on the other side of the Wall than this side.	21	4	9
229	 We've got loads of weapons and things.	21	4	9
230	 It's the perfect place for us to be.	21	4	9
231	 I've never thrown a spear before.	21	4	9
232	 I've never held a sword with a proper edge.	21	4	9
233	 This is no place for me to be.	21	4	9
234	 You're not afraid?	21	4	9
235	 Of course I'm afraid.	21	4	9
236	 There's a band of wildlings coming to kill us.	21	4	9
237	 If you're afraid of a band of wildlings,	21	4	9
238	 how in seven hells did you manage to kill a white walker?	21	4	9
239	 I didn't know I was going to kill it.	21	4	9
240	 But I had to do something. I didn't have any choice.	22	4	9
241	 It was going to kill Gilly and take the baby.	22	4	9
242	 If someone had asked me my name right then,	22	4	9
243	 I wouldn't have known.	22	4	9
244	 I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore.	22	4	9
245	 I wasn't a steward in the Night's Watch	22	4	9
246	 or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that.	22	4	9
247	 I was nothing at all.	22	4	9
248	 And when you're nothing at all,	22	4	9
249	 there's no more reason to be afraid.	22	4	9
250	 But you're afraid now?	22	4	9
251	 Yes, well...	22	4	9
252	 I'm not nothing anymore.	22	4	9
253	 Most of their men are up top.	23	4	9
254	 Didn't count more than 20 down here. Leftovers.	23	4	9
255	 They got a big fat one and a little bony one manning the front.	23	4	9
256	 How high are the walls?	23	4	9
257	 Well, we'll be up and over before they know what's happened.	23	4	9
258	 Let's kill some crows!	23	4	9
259	 Come on!	23	4	9
260	 Come on, brothers!	24	4	9
261	 Archers nock.	25	4	9
262	 Everyone else hold.	25	4	9
263	 Grenn, no!	25	4	9
264	 I said nock and hold, you cunts!	25	4	9
265	 - Does nock mean draw? - No, Ser!	25	4	9
266	 - Does fucking hold mean fucking drop? - No, Ser!	25	4	9
267	 - You all plan to die here tonight? - No, Ser!	25	4	9
268	 That's very good to hear. Draw!	25	4	9
269	 No, down below!	26	4	9
270	 Draw! Light them up.	26	4	9
271	 Come on, get up!	26	4	9
272	 They're attacking the southern gate!	26	4	9
273	 - Now? - Now.	26	4	9
274	 I'm going down there. Brother Slynt, you have the Wall.	26	4	9
275	 What?	26	4	9
276	 What are you fucking waiting for? Loose!	27	4	9
277	 You heard the man. Loose!	27	4	9
278	 You, over there.	27	4	9
279	 - Did you get one? - No.	28	4	9
280	 Ah, shit, Pyp! Shit.	28	4	9
281	 - Sam. - Yeah?	28	4	9
282	 I think we're gonna die.	28	4	9
283	 If you keep missing, we will.	28	4	9
284	 Come on! Come on!	28	4	9
285	 Brothers!	28	4	9
286	 100 generations have defended this castle.	28	4	9
287	 She's never fallen before.	28	4	9
288	 She will not fall tonight.	28	4	9
289	 Those are Thenns at our walls.	28	4	9
290	 They eat the flesh of the men they kill.	28	4	9
291	 Do you want to fill the belly of a Thenn tonight?	28	4	9
292	 No!	28	4	9
293	 Tonight we fight.	28	4	9
294	 And when the sun rises, I promise you,	29	4	9
295	 Castle Black will stand!	29	4	9
296	 The Night's Watch will stand.	29	4	9
297	 With me now! Now with me!	29	4	9
298	 No discipline. No training.	30	4	9
299	 Gang of thieves, that's all this is.	30	4	9
300	 I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing.	30	4	9
301	 Those men obeyed orders.	30	4	9
302	 We can't just let them attack the gate!	30	4	9
303	 The bars of those gates are four inches of cold-rolled steel.	30	4	9
304	 Those are giants riding mammoths down there!	30	4	9
305	 Do you think your cold-rolled steel is gonna stop them?	30	4	9
306	 No such thing as giants.	30	4	9
307	 A story for the children.	30	4	9
308	 Brother Slynt.	30	4	9
309	 We just got word that Ser Alliser needs you below.	30	4	9
310	 You're the most experienced man he's got, Ser, and he needs you.	31	4	9
311	 Needed below?	31	4	9
312	 Yes. Yes.	31	4	9
313	 Archers, nock your arrows!	31	4	9
314	 Nock arrows!	31	4	9
315	 Draw!	31	4	9
316	 Loose!	31	4	9
317	 - They won't summit before dawn. - How do you know that?	31	4	9
318	 Because I've made that climb.	32	4	9
319	 I think they're in a bigger hurry than you were.	32	4	9
320	 Hold the bridge!	32	4	9
321	 Hold, wait for it!	32	4	9
322	 Come on with the rocks!	32	4	9
323	 Nock!	32	4	9
324	 Draw!	32	4	9
325	 Loose!	32	4	9
326	 Down!	32	4	9
327	 No! No!	33	4	9
328	 To the gate. Come on, let's move.	34	4	9
329	 It's gonna open.	34	4	9
330	 I got one, right through the heart. He's dead.	35	4	9
331	 - Oh, is it over? - No.	35	4	9
332	 Well, then...	35	4	9
333	 You're all right. You're all right.	35	4	9
334	 I'll get help.	35	4	9
335	 Shh. Shh.	36	4	9
336	 Maester Aemon is coming.	36	4	9
337	 He's gonna make it all right.	36	4	9
338	 Shh. Shh.	36	4	9
339	 - Now. - Now!	36	4	9
340	 The outer gate won't hold.	38	4	9
341	 Take five men, hold the inner gate.	38	4	9
342	 Aye.	38	4	9
343	 Hold the gate.	38	4	9
344	 If they make it through...	38	4	9
345	 They won't.	38	4	9
346	 Come on, Hill. And you, Cooper.	38	4	9
347	 You three, on me.	38	4	9
348	 Come on, you lazy bastards.	38	4	9
349	 Oil.	38	4	9
350	 Oil on the ramp!	38	4	9
351	 Protect the gate!	39	4	9
352	 Get him inside.	39	4	9
353	 Hold the fucking gate!	40	4	9
354	 Hold it!	40	4	9
355	 We need more men down here.	41	4	9
356	 - We have to hold the gate. - But we need men here.	41	4	9
357	 Tell Jon. He's in command.	41	4	9
358	 Let's go.	41	4	9
359	 Get me to the top! You hear me?!	41	4	9
360	 Your name's Olly, right?	41	4	9
361	 Listen to me, Olly. Get me to the top.	41	4	9
362	 And when we give the signal, bring us back down.	41	4	9
363	 You hear me?	41	4	9
364	 Find a weapon, Olly. Fight them.	42	4	9
365	 Clear the way! Let's go!	42	4	9
366	 - Out of the way! - Get out of here!	42	4	9
367	 Cut the rope!	43	4	9
368	 Wait! No!	43	4	9
369	 - We need more archers. - Here I am.	43	4	9
370	 - Come on. - Quickly.	43	4	9
371	 What are you doing up here?	43	4	9
372	 The wildlings are over the walls.	43	4	9
373	 Ser Alliser's fallen.	43	4	9
374	 The castle won't stand much longer.	43	4	9
375	 Edd, you have the Wall.	44	4	9
376	 If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them.	44	4	9
377	 If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them.	44	4	9
378	 Come, brothers. Now fight with me!	44	4	9
379	 Might as well enjoy our last night, right, boys?	44	4	9
380	 Light the fuckers up!	44	4	9
381	 Nock! Draw!	44	4	9
382	 Loose!	44	4	9
383	 How are we gonna stop that?	44	4	9
384	 Shot 20 arrows in him already.	44	4	9
385	 You heard Jon. We hold the gate.	44	4	9
386	 Jon Snow's not Lord Commander.	44	4	9
387	 We hold the gate!	44	4	9
388	 Mother, save me. Father, save me.	45	4	9
389	 The gods aren't down here.	45	4	9
390	 It's the six of us. You hear me?	45	4	9
391	 No, please.	45	4	9
392	 Night gathers and now my watch begins.	45	4	9
393	 It shall not end until my death.	45	4	9
394	 I shall take no wife, hold no lands,	45	4	9
395	 father no children.	45	4	9
396	 I shall wear no crown and win no glory.	45	4	9
397	 I shall live and die at my post.	45	4	9
398	 I am the sword in the darkness.	45	4	9
399	 I am the watcher on the walls.	45	4	9
400	 I am the shield that guards the realms of men.	45	4	9
401	 I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch	45	4	9
402	 for this night and all the nights to come!	45	4	9
403	 I don't want you out there.	46	4	9
404	 You can't protect me forever.	46	4	9
405	 There won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.	46	4	9
406	 I need him more than I need you.	46	4	9
407	 We need you, boy.	47	4	9
408	 Ha!	48	4	9
409	 Jon Snow.	50	4	9
410	 Hush. Don't talk.	50	4	9
411	 Do you remember the cave?	50	4	9
412	 We should have stayed in the cave.	50	4	9
413	 We'll go back there.	51	4	9
414	 You know nothing, Jon Snow.	51	4	9
415	 Drop the scythe, boys!	51	4	9
416	 - Hoist her up. - Hoist her up!	52	4	9
417	 They've had enough for one night.	52	4	9
418	 Don't cheer too loud.	52	4	9
419	 They still outnumber us 1,000 to one.	52	4	9
420	 Tormund.	53	4	9
421	 It's over.	53	4	9
422	 Let it end.	53	4	9
423	 This is how a man ends.	53	4	9
424	 Put him in chains.	53	4	9
425	 We'll question him later.	53	4	9
426	 I should have thrown you...	53	4	9
427	 from the top of the Wall, boy!	53	4	9
428	 Aye.	53	4	9
429	 You should have.	53	4	9
430	 Whoa, it's me. It's me.	53	4	9
431	 I promised you, didn't I?	54	4	9
432	 We held them off.	54	4	9
433	 For one night.	54	4	9
434	 This is a great victory.	54	4	9
435	 A great victory?	54	4	9
436	 Mance was testing our defenses.	54	4	9
437	 He almost made it through.	54	4	9
438	 And he has more giants. He has more mammoths.	54	4	9
439	 He has 1,000 times as many men.	54	4	9
440	 They'll hit us again tonight.	54	4	9
441	 Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two,	54	4	9
442	 but we'll never beat them.	54	4	9
443	 Where are we going?	54	4	9
444	 Going to find Mance.	54	4	9
445	 To fi... you can't do that.	55	4	9
446	 No one gave you any orders.	55	4	9
447	 Who's left to give orders?	55	4	9
448	 The wildling army's only an army because of Mance.	55	4	9
449	 He united 100 warring tribes.	55	4	9
450	 Without Mance, they lose their leader.	55	4	9
451	 They lose their purpose. They go back to fighting each other.	55	4	9
452	 Scatter back to their homes.	55	4	9
453	 Without Mance?	55	4	9
454	 You're going to kill him?	55	4	9
455	 I'm gonna try.	55	4	9
456	 They'll never let you within 100 yards of him.	55	4	9
457	 And even if they did, even if you managed to kill him...	55	4	9
458	 They'll kill me? If I don't go, they'll kill me anyway.	55	4	9
459	 They'll kill the rest of us, too.	55	4	9
460	 They won't just kill you.	55	4	9
461	 They'll boil you. They'll flay you.	55	4	9
462	 They'll make it last days.	55	4	9
463	 You're right. It's a bad plan.	55	4	9
464	 What's your plan?	55	4	9
465	 They held the gate.	56	4	9
466	 Get some brothers down here to help you.	57	4	9
467	 We need to burn the bodies.	57	4	9
468	 Raise the outer gate.	57	4	9
469	 Then lower it again as soon as I'm out.	57	4	9
470	 What are you doing?	58	4	9
471	 I promised Mormont I'd never lose it again.	58	4	9
472	 In case I don't come back.	58	4	9
473	 Jon.	58	4	9
474	 Come back.	58	4	9
475		59	4	9

0	 My son, Jorah, fled Westeros.	0	5	6
1	 He brought dishonor to our house.	0	5	6
2	 I need to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.	0	5	6
3	 And how's this going, Commander Mormont?	0	5	6
4	 I shall have your head!	0	5	6
5	 You're taking us through Valyria.	0	5	6
6	 The Doom still rules Valyria.	0	5	6
7	 Stone Men!	0	5	6
8	 Had any touch you?	0	5	6
9	 You?	0	5	6
10	 The Eyrie is mine.	0	5	6
11	 The last time the Lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the Lords of the North,	0	5	6
12	 they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known.	0	5	6
13	 Cersei sent for me.	0	5	6
14	 I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.	0	5	6
15	 I hope I can make her happy.	0	5	6
16	 She suffered enough.	1	5	6
17	 I'll never hurt her!	1	5	6
18	 All sinners are equal before the Gods.	1	5	6
19	 What would you say if I told you of a great sinner in our very midst?	1	5	6
20	 May the Father judge him justly.	1	5	6
21	 - Who do you think you are? - Justice.	1	5	6
22	 Your brother was murdered, while you sit here, doing nothing.	1	5	6
23	 The Sand Snakes are with me.	1	5	6
24	 Without Doran we have no army to march against the Lannisters.	1	5	6
25	 Queen Cersei loves her children.	1	5	6
26	 And we have one of them.	1	5	6
27	 We rescue my niece, bring her back to the family.	1	5	6
28	 You ever been to Dorne?	1	5	6
29	 The Dornish are crazy.	1	5	6
30	 If he gets to her before we do, we lose our only chance for revenge.	1	5	6
31	 Here we serve the Many-Faced God.	1	5	6
32	 To serve well, a girl must become no one.	1	5	6
33	 What do we with them after you wash them?	1	5	6
34	nan	3	5	6
35	 What are they doing with the bodies?	6	5	6
36	 Get back to work.	6	5	6
37	 No. I've been here for weeks.	6	5	6
38	 I'm not scrubbing one more corpse	6	5	6
39	 until you tell me why I'm doing it.	6	5	6
40	 You will know why.	6	5	6
41	 - When? - When it's time, not before.	6	5	6
42	 Get back to work.	6	5	6
43	 When do I get to play the game?	6	5	6
44	 Game?	6	5	6
45	 The game. The Game of Faces.	6	5	6
46	 You tried already. You failed.	6	5	6
47	 I didn't even know I was playing.	6	5	6
48	 Who are you?	6	5	6
49	 No one.	6	5	6
50	 Get back to work.	6	5	6
51	 Who are you?	6	5	6
52	 What are you doing here? How did you get here?	6	5	6
53	 I'm from Westeros just like you.	7	5	6
54	 Daughter of a lord just like you.	7	5	6
55	 Except I was an only child.	7	5	6
56	 Heir to his fortune.	7	5	6
57	 My mother died.	7	5	6
58	 My father remarried and his new wife	7	5	6
59	 gave birth to a girl.	7	5	6
60	 My stepmother didn't want any rivals for her precious daughter,	7	5	6
61	 so she tried to kill me with poison.	7	5	6
62	 I found out.	7	5	6
63	 Sought help from the Faceless Men.	7	5	6
64	 And my father was widowed again.	7	5	6
65	 I've been serving them ever since.	7	5	6
66	 Was that true or a lie?	7	5	6
67	 What?	8	5	6
68	 Did you believe every word I said?	8	5	6
69	 Get back to work.	8	5	6
70	 Who are you?	8	5	6
71	 Who are you?	8	5	6
72	 Arya.	8	5	6
73	 And where did you come from?	8	5	6
74	 Westeros.	8	5	6
75	 My family home is Winterfell.	9	5	6
76	 I'm the youngest daughter of a great lord,	9	5	6
77	 Eddard Stark.	9	5	6
78	 He died in battle.	9	5	6
79	 A lie.	9	5	6
80	 After he was executed, I fled the capital.	9	5	6
81	 Had to kill a stable boy.	9	5	6
82	 Drove my sword through his back.	9	5	6
83	 A lie.	9	5	6
84	 I stabbed him in the gut.	9	5	6
85	 I tried to find my mother and brother,	9	5	6
86	 but I never did.	9	5	6
87	 They were murdered by Walder Frey.	9	5	6
88	 An outlaw kidnapped me, a man called Polliver.	9	5	6
89	 A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane.	9	5	6
90	 He tried to sell me, but was wounded in a fight.	9	5	6
91	 He begged me to kill him, but I wouldn't.	9	5	6
92	 I left him in the mountains to die.	9	5	6
93	 I wanted him to suffer. I hated him.	9	5	6
94	 I hated him.	10	5	6
95	 That's not a lie!	10	5	6
96	 A girl lies to me,	10	5	6
97	 to the Many-Faced God, to herself.	10	5	6
98	 Does she truly want to be no one?	10	5	6
99	 Yes.	10	5	6
100	 I'm not playing this stupid game anymore!	10	5	6
101	 We never stop playing.	10	5	6
102	 So, those villages we were supposed to find?	10	5	6
103	 We can't live on berries and roots.	11	5	6
104	 I can.	11	5	6
105	 You're not hungry?	11	5	6
106	 Of course I'm hungry.	11	5	6
107	 You're an awful travelling companion, do you know that?	11	5	6
108	 Possibly the least charming man I've ever met.	11	5	6
109	 I'm not your travelling companion.	11	5	6
110	 We are travelling together in each other's company, therefore--	11	5	6
111	 Do you ever shut up?	11	5	6
112	 I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos in a crate	11	5	6
113	 without ever saying a word.	11	5	6
114	 Why?	11	5	6
115	 It never occurred to you to ask why until now?	11	5	6
116	 You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister	11	5	6
117	 decided to visit a brothel in Volantis?	11	5	6
118	 I'm sure you visited many brothels in many cities.	11	5	6
119	 I killed my father.	11	5	6
120	 He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn't commit.	11	5	6
121	 And he was fucking the woman I loved.	12	5	6
122	 As miserable as you are, Mormont,	12	5	6
123	 at least your father was a good man.	12	5	6
124	 What do you know about my father?	12	5	6
125	 I met him. I visited the Wall.	12	5	6
126	 When I asked him about his men,	12	5	6
127	 he knew all their stories, every one of them.	12	5	6
128	 He actually cared about the people under his command.	12	5	6
129	 How do they put it in the Watch?	12	5	6
130	" ""We shall never see his like again."""	12	5	6
131	 Oh, you didn't know.	12	5	6
132	 I'm sorry. I am.	13	5	6
133	 How?	13	5	6
134	 I only know what I heard.	13	5	6
135	 How?	13	5	6
136	 He was leading an expedition beyond the Wall.	13	5	6
137	 There was a mutiny.	13	5	6
138	 He was murdered by his own men.	13	5	6
139	 We better keep moving.	13	5	6
140	 Valar morghulis.	14	5	6
141	 Valar dohaeris.	14	5	6
142	 I have nowhere else to go.	14	5	6
143	 I've taken her to every healer in Braavos.	14	5	6
144	 I've spent every penny I had.	14	5	6
145	 She suffers every day of her life.	14	5	6
146	 I just want it to end.	15	5	6
147	 It hurts.	15	5	6
148	 I know.	15	5	6
149	 Don't be afraid.	15	5	6
150	 I used to be like you.	15	5	6
151	 I was sick.	15	5	6
152	 I was dying.	15	5	6
153	 But my father never gave up on me.	15	5	6
154	 He loved me	16	5	6
155	 more than anything in the world,	16	5	6
156	 just like your father loves you.	16	5	6
157	 So he brought me here.	16	5	6
158	 My father prayed to the Many-Faced God.	16	5	6
159	 And I drank the water from his fountain.	16	5	6
160	 It healed me.	16	5	6
161	 I've devoted my life to him now.	16	5	6
162	 You don't want to hurt anymore?	16	5	6
163	 Drink.	16	5	6
164	 Is a girl ready?	19	5	6
165	 To give up her ears, her nose, her tongue?	19	5	6
166	 Her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates?	20	5	6
167	 All that makes a girl who she is?	20	5	6
168	 Forever?	20	5	6
169	 No.	20	5	6
170	 A girl is not ready to become no one.	20	5	6
171	 But she is ready to become someone else.	20	5	6
172	 Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this?	20	5	6
173	 As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens	20	5	6
174	 during Robert's Rebellion.	20	5	6
175	 Do you believe in anything?	20	5	6
176	 I believe in lots of things.	20	5	6
177	 In something greater than ourselves, I mean.	21	5	6
178	 The gods, destiny.	21	5	6
179	 Do you believe there's a plan for this world?	21	5	6
180	 No.	21	5	6
181	 Neither did I.	21	5	6
182	 I was a cynic just like you.	21	5	6
183	 Then I saw a girl step into a great fire	21	5	6
184	 with three stone eggs.	21	5	6
185	 When the fire burned out, I thought I'd find her blackened bones.	21	5	6
186	 Instead, I saw her, Daenerys,	21	5	6
187	 alive and unhurt, holding her baby dragons.	21	5	6
188	 Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?	21	5	6
189	 No.	21	5	6
190	 It's hard to be a cynic after that.	21	5	6
191	 Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen.	21	5	6
192	 No, it doesn't.	21	5	6
193	 The Targaryens are famously insane.	21	5	6
194	 What if she conquers the world? Then what?	21	5	6
195	 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?	21	5	6
196	 First we have to conquer the world.	21	5	6
197	 We?	22	5	6
198	 All right, let's assume your dreams come true.	22	5	6
199	 She's ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf.	22	5	6
200	 She hacks off my head and restores your position.	22	5	6
201	 You command her army, sail to Westeros,	22	5	6
202	 defeat all your enemies and watch her climb those steps	22	5	6
203	 and sit on the Iron Throne.	22	5	6
204	 Hurrah. Long live the queen. Then what?	22	5	6
205	 Then she rules.	22	5	6
206	 So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life	22	5	6
207	 in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That's justice?	22	5	6
208	 - She's the rightful heir. - Why?	22	5	6
209	 Because her father, who burned living men for amusement, was the king?	22	5	6
210	 - That's a slave ship. - Why are they anchored?	22	5	6
211	 They probably came ashore for--	22	5	6
212	 Water.	22	5	6
213	 Got a lot of fight in you, huh?	23	5	6
214	 Salt mines?	23	5	6
215	 Yeah, that or a galley slave.	23	5	6
216	 He looks strong enough.	23	5	6
217	 What about the dwarf?	23	5	6
218	 Worthless.	23	5	6
219	 Cut his throat.	23	5	6
220	 Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait! Let's discuss this.	23	5	6
221	 And then chop off his cock.	23	5	6
222	 We'll sell it for a fortune.	23	5	6
223	 A dwarf's cock has magic powers.	23	5	6
224	 Wait! Wait!	23	5	6
225	 Wait, wait, wait!	23	5	6
226	 You can't just hand a dry cock to a merchant	23	5	6
227	 and expect him to pay for it.	23	5	6
228	 He has to know it came from a dwarf.	23	5	6
229	 And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?	23	5	6
230	 It will be a dwarf-sized cock.	23	5	6
231	 Guess again.	23	5	6
232	 The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.	24	5	6
233	 Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.	24	5	6
234	 We're bound for Volantis, not Slaver's Bay.	24	5	6
235	 Besides, she reopened the fighting pits.	24	5	6
236	 I've never heard of free men fighting in the pits.	24	5	6
237	 The fighting pits in Meereen?	24	5	6
238	 You're in luck, then. You're about to be rich.	24	5	6
239	 You are looking at one of the great warriors in the Seven Kingdoms.	24	5	6
240	 Him.	24	5	6
241	 Him? He's got to be 60 years old.	24	5	6
242	 Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth,	24	5	6
243	 a bit withered, been in the sun too long.	24	5	6
244	 We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles.	24	5	6
245	 They wrote songs about him.	24	5	6
246	 That true?	25	5	6
247	 He won the tournament at Lannisport.	25	5	6
248	 Unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.	25	5	6
249	 The Kingslayer.	25	5	6
250	 Jousting. You're talking about jousting.	25	5	6
251	 A fancy game for fancy lads.	25	5	6
252	 The men who fight in the pits of Meereen will swallow him whole.	25	5	6
253	 I killed a Dothraki bloodrider in single combat.	25	5	6
254	 Liar.	25	5	6
255	 It's no lie. His name was Qotho.	25	5	6
256	 He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo.	25	5	6
257	 Take me to Slaver's Bay, put a sword in my hand,	25	5	6
258	 I'll prove my worth.	26	5	6
259	 For my children. Money.	26	5	6
260	 Lord Baelish.	26	5	6
261	 Yes?	26	5	6
262	 Lancel Lannister.	26	5	6
263	 Brother Lancel.	26	5	6
264	 We abandon our family names.	26	5	6
265	 Quite a family to abandon.	26	5	6
266	 The city has changed since you were here last.	26	5	6
267	 We flooded the gutters with wine,	26	5	6
268	 smashed the false idols,	26	5	6
269	 and set the godless on the run.	26	5	6
270	 Well done.	26	5	6
271	 I'm here on urgent business for the Queen Mother.	27	5	6
272	 Should I send word that I'll be delayed?	27	5	6
273	 Step carefully, Lord Baelish.	27	5	6
274	 You'll find there's little tolerance for flesh peddlers	27	5	6
275	 in the new King's Landing.	27	5	6
276	 We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel.	27	5	6
277	 Mine just happen to be entertaining.	27	5	6
278	 Do you think it's wise, Your Grace,	27	5	6
279	 arresting the heir to Highgarden?	27	5	6
280	 The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.	27	5	6
281	 Of course, and the Faith were armed on your orders.	27	5	6
282	 The king's orders.	27	5	6
283	 Is the king to blame for Ser Loras's perversion?	27	5	6
284	 House Tyrell won't tolerate this insult.	27	5	6
285	 House Tyrell won't tolerate it?	27	5	6
286	 I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish.	27	5	6
287	 Ser Loras was promised to me.	28	5	6
288	 Instead he chose the company of boys.	28	5	6
289	 One's choice of companion is a curious thing.	28	5	6
290	 Most curious.	28	5	6
291	 Lysa Arryn, for instance.	28	5	6
292	 Thoroughly repellant woman.	28	5	6
293	 Forgive me.	28	5	6
294	 I know you're still in mourning.	28	5	6
295	 Lysa was a good woman.	28	5	6
296	 A kind woman.	28	5	6
297	 She was neither of those things. We both know it.	28	5	6
298	 Still, I pity her son.	28	5	6
299	 How fortunate the young Lord of the Vale	28	5	6
300	 has a new father to counsel him.	28	5	6
301	 I know how hard it can be	28	5	6
302	 to lose both your parents at such a young age.	28	5	6
303	 If war comes to Westeros, will the Knights of the Vale fight for their king?	28	5	6
304	 Young Lord Robin heeds my advice.	28	5	6
305	 And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.	28	5	6
306	 Good.	28	5	6
307	 If there's nothing else.	29	5	6
308	 There is another matter, Your Grace.	29	5	6
309	 Something so urgent I couldn't trust the words to a raven.	29	5	6
310	 You once charged me with finding Arya Stark.	29	5	6
311	 To my shame, I failed you.	29	5	6
312	 But I have found Sansa Stark.	29	5	6
313	 Alive and well and home again	29	5	6
314	 living at Winterfell.	29	5	6
315	 That's not possible.	29	5	6
316	 My sources are well placed.	29	5	6
317	 They tell me Roose Bolton	29	5	6
318	 plans to marry her to his son Ramsay,	29	5	6
319	 a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen.	29	5	6
320	 Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.	29	5	6
321	 Indeed, his reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.	29	5	6
322	 We were fools to trust a turncloak.	29	5	6
323	 Marrying his son to the last of the Starks	29	5	6
324	 gives him more legitimacy in the North	29	5	6
325	 than an alliance with a hated southern house.	30	5	6
326	 I will skin him and his bastard	30	5	6
327	 like that wretch on their bloody sigil.	30	5	6
328	 I would counsel patience, Your Grace.	30	5	6
329	 Patience?	30	5	6
330	 Sansa helped murder my son.	30	5	6
331	 Roose Bolton is a traitor.	30	5	6
332	 Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor,	30	5	6
333	 marching with his army on Winterfell.	30	5	6
334	 Let Stannis and Roose battle.	30	5	6
335	 Let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other.	30	5	6
336	 And when they're done, seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives.	30	5	6
337	 Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here.	30	5	6
338	 The weather has already begun to turn.	30	5	6
339	 That is why it is critical to strike soon	30	5	6
340	 while the victor still licks his wounds.	30	5	6
341	 Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force.	30	5	6
342	 My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.	30	5	6
343	 Ser Jaime, then.	30	5	6
344	 Jaime's away on a sensitive diplomatic mission.	30	5	6
345	 I have no idea when he'll be back.	30	5	6
346	 Perhaps I can help.	30	5	6
347	 The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros,	31	5	6
348	 trained to battle in the ice and the snow.	31	5	6
349	 Forgive me, Lord Baelish,	31	5	6
350	 you have a reputation as a moneylender	31	5	6
351	 and a brothel keeper, not a military man.	31	5	6
352	 You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier	31	5	6
353	 or a single coin from the royal treasury.	31	5	6
354	 What do you have to lose?	31	5	6
355	 A brothel keeper?	31	5	6
356	 And if you succeed?	31	5	6
357	 Name me Warden of the North.	31	5	6
358	 I'll speak to the king this evening,	31	5	6
359	 have him issue a royal decree.	31	5	6
360	 I'll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.	31	5	6
361	 And I'll know you're a man of your word	31	5	6
362	 when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.	31	5	6
363	 As I said...	31	5	6
364	 I live to serve.	31	5	6
365	 I'm going to ask him tomorrow.	32	5	6
366	 - What if he says no? - He won't.	32	5	6
367	 We've waited long enough.	32	5	6
368	 I want you to be my wife.	32	5	6
369	 Now.	32	5	6
370	 What is it?	32	5	6
371	 Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it?	32	5	6
372	 Or do you--	32	5	6
373	 We can't. Not yet.	32	5	6
374	 Why not?	32	5	6
375	 You know why not. Someone will see.	32	5	6
376	 You are going to be my wife.	32	5	6
377	 I am going to be your husband.	32	5	6
378	 We're allowed to walk through the gardens together.	32	5	6
379	 How many other girls have you walked through these gardens?	32	5	6
380	 I like the way your eyes go squinty when you're jealous.	32	5	6
381	 They do not go squinty and you didn't answer the question.	32	5	6
382	 They make a lovely couple.	33	5	6
383	 A Lannister and a Martell.	33	5	6
384	 They have no idea how dangerous that is.	33	5	6
385	 We must protect them.	33	5	6
386	 Yes, my prince.	33	5	6
387	 You haven't had to use that axe of yours in a long time.	33	5	6
388	 I hope you remember how.	33	5	6
389	 I remember how.	33	5	6
390	  The Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun	33	5	6
391	 And her kisses were warmer than spring	33	5	6
392	 The Dornishman's blade	33	5	6
393	 It was made of black steel	33	5	6
394	 And its kiss was a terrible thing	33	5	6
395	 The Dornishman's wife would sing as she bathed	33	5	6
396	 -  In a voice that was sweet as a peach-- - All right, that's enough.	33	5	6
397	 I'm coming to the best part.	34	5	6
398	 We're trying to blend in.	34	5	6
399	 Don't want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent.	34	5	6
400	 This song really is all about the ending.	34	5	6
401	 It can wait. There.	34	5	6
402	 That's the Water Gardens.	34	5	6
403	 And once we've got the princess, then what?	34	5	6
404	 I like to improvise.	34	5	6
405	 That explains the golden hand.	34	5	6
406	 Unbowed. Unbent. Unbroken.	34	5	6
407	 For Oberyn.	34	5	6
408	 For Oberyn.	34	5	6
409	 Well, she's made herself at home.	35	5	6
410	 Myrcella.	35	5	6
411	 Uncle Jaime?	35	5	6
412	 I--	36	5	6
413	 I don't understand. What are you doing here?	36	5	6
414	 Let's speak in private.	36	5	6
415	 - I am Trystane Martell. - Trystane is my intended.	36	5	6
416	 Excellent. Good to meet you.	36	5	6
417	 We weren't expecting you, Lord Jaime.	36	5	6
418	 Why don't you let them have some time alone, son?	36	5	6
419	 Let's not do something stupid.	36	5	6
420	 That was something stupid.	36	5	6
421	 We have to go, Myrcella, now.	36	5	6
422	 - You hurt him! - He'll be fine, I promise.	36	5	6
423	 But we have to--	36	5	6
424	 Oh, for fuck's sake.	36	5	6
425	 Take her!	37	5	6
426	 - You're coming with me. - I don't want to.	37	5	6
427	 I wasn't asking, princess.	37	5	6
428	 - Ah! - Drop your weapons!	37	5	6
429	 I am Obara Sand.	38	5	6
430	 Daughter of Oberyn Martell.	38	5	6
431	 I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for?	38	5	6
432	 Drop your weapons.	38	5	6
433	 When you were whole, it would have been a good fight.	38	5	6
434	 You fight pretty good for a little girl.	38	5	6
435	 Halt!	39	5	6
436	 Oh, you can smell the shit from five miles away.	39	5	6
437	 Well, why have we stopped? Go on.	39	5	6
438	 Rumors and gossip, that's all they've got.	39	5	6
439	 It's theater, nothing more.	39	5	6
440	 If they arrested all the pillow biters in King's Landing,	39	5	6
441	 there'd be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else.	39	5	6
442	 Everyone knew about him and Renly.	39	5	6
443	 Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms.	39	5	6
444	 Everyone knew, no one cared.	39	5	6
445	 But he was the king's brother.	39	5	6
446	 And Loras is the queen's brother.	39	5	6
447	 No, no, no, no. This is unacceptable.	39	5	6
448	 - Cersei's behind it. - Yeah, of course she is.	40	5	6
449	 She wants to drag our name through the dirt,	40	5	6
450	 put us in our place.	40	5	6
451	 Get some rest, dear. You look appalling.	40	5	6
452	 Let me deal with Cersei Lannister.	40	5	6
453	 Your Grace, I have travelled a long way.	40	5	6
454	 You must be exhausted.	40	5	6
455	 Put the pen down, dear. We both know you're not writing anything.	40	5	6
456	 Ah, yes. The famously tart-tongued Queen of Thorns.	40	5	6
457	 And the famous tart Queen Cersei.	40	5	6
458	 I beg your pardon?	40	5	6
459	 I know you're behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.	40	5	6
460	 If you apologize for that comment, perhaps I'll--	40	5	6
461	 You'll get your apology when I get Loras.	40	5	6
462	 I was as shocked as anyone	40	5	6
463	 when the Faith arrested Ser Loras.	41	5	6
464	 I have no love for these fanatics,	41	5	6
465	 but what can a Queen Mother do?	41	5	6
466	 Has the crown suddenly stopped needing	41	5	6
467	 the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?	41	5	6
468	 I can assure you,	41	5	6
469	 our alliance with House Tyrell remains--	41	5	6
470	 Do you expect the alliance to continue	41	5	6
471	 after you've thrown our future into prison?	41	5	6
472	 As I said,	41	5	6
473	 I didn't imprison anyone.	41	5	6
474	 As for your veiled threats--	41	5	6
475	 What veil?	41	5	6
476	 The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country.	41	5	6
477	 Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?	41	5	6
478	 I didn't trust your father.	41	5	6
479	 I didn't particularly like him.	41	5	6
480	 But I respected him. He was no fool.	41	5	6
481	 He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals	41	5	6
482	 rather than destroy them.	42	5	6
483	 House Lannister has no rival.	42	5	6
484	 The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial.	42	5	6
485	 Just a small hearing to determine	42	5	6
486	 whether the charges against Loras have merit,	42	5	6
487	 which I'm sure they don't.	42	5	6
488	 Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue...	42	5	6
489	 and we'll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened.	42	5	6
490	 Good day, Lady Olenna.	42	5	6
491	 You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?	42	5	6
492	 I don't pay attention to rumors.	42	5	6
493	 You were said to be despondent when he died.	43	5	6
494	 Witnesses state that you refused to leave his bedside	43	5	6
495	 even as Stannis's army closed in.	43	5	6
496	 He was my friend. He was my king.	43	5	6
497	 Wasn't Joffrey your king?	43	5	6
498	 He was anointed by the Seven, not Renly.	43	5	6
499	 I was wrong to support Renly's claim, I know that.	43	5	6
500	 But I was forgiven by Joffrey.	43	5	6
501	 I fought for him at the Battle of Blackwater.	43	5	6
502	 Yes, wearing Renly's armor.	43	5	6
503	 Why does it matter what I wore?	43	5	6
504	 Do you deny all the charges against you?	43	5	6
505	 Fornication.	43	5	6
506	 Buggery. Blasphemy.	43	5	6
507	 Of course I deny them.	43	5	6
508	 You never lay with Renly Baratheon?	43	5	6
509	 Never.	43	5	6
510	 Nor any other man?	43	5	6
511	 Never.	43	5	6
512	 That will be all, Ser Loras.	44	5	6
513	 Well, I think that's quite enough of that.	44	5	6
514	 The Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.	44	5	6
515	 You call me forward?	44	5	6
516	 Yes, we have some questions for you.	44	5	6
517	 - I am the queen. - You are.	44	5	6
518	 And according to the law of the Seven,	44	5	6
519	 neither kings nor queens are exempt	44	5	6
520	 from testimony at a holy inquest.	44	5	6
521	 How do you respond to these charges against your brother?	44	5	6
522	 They are lies.	45	5	6
523	 - All of them? - All of them.	45	5	6
524	 Queen Margaery,	45	5	6
525	 in the presence of the gods,	45	5	6
526	 do you swear that your brother is innocent	45	5	6
527	 of these charges against him	45	5	6
528	 to the best of your knowledge?	45	5	6
529	 Yes, I swear it.	45	5	6
530	 Thank you, Your Grace.	45	5	6
531	 Do you know this man?	45	5	6
532	 Yes, very well.	45	5	6
533	 He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden.	45	5	6
534	 How did you come to meet?	45	5	6
535	 I squired for him.	46	5	6
536	 He took a liking to me.	46	5	6
537	 He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met.	46	5	6
538	 And what occurred in his chamber?	46	5	6
539	 We engaged in intimate relations.	46	5	6
540	 You lay with him?	46	5	6
541	 That night and many others.	46	5	6
542	 Liar. He's a liar.	46	5	6
543	 Is there anyone else who can support your claim?	46	5	6
544	 Yes.	46	5	6
545	 Yes, Queen Margaery.	46	5	6
546	 She walked in on us once not long ago.	46	5	6
547	 She didn't seem surprised.	46	5	6
548	 This testimony is an insult to a great house.	46	5	6
549	 Why should the Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire	46	5	6
550	 over the heir to Highgarden?	46	5	6
551	 He has a birthmark, Your Grace.	46	5	6
552	 Quite high on his thigh.	46	5	6
553	 Wine-colored and roughly the shape of Dorne.	46	5	6
554	 No! Liar!	47	5	6
555	 What are you doing? Let us pass.	47	5	6
556	 The Faith is satisfied there is enough evidence	47	5	6
557	 to bring a formal trial	47	5	6
558	 for Ser Loras	47	5	6
559	 and Queen Margaery.	47	5	6
560	 What?	47	5	6
561	 Bearing false witness before the gods	47	5	6
562	 is as grave a sin as any, my lady.	47	5	6
563	 Take her.	47	5	6
564	 No. Tommen.	47	5	6
565	 Tommen!	47	5	6
566	 You can't do this. I am the queen.	47	5	6
567	 Tommen! Tommen!	47	5	6
568	 I am your queen. How dare you?	47	5	6
569	 Take your hands off me!	47	5	6
570	 Tommen!	47	5	6
571	 What do you want?	48	5	6
572	 Lord Ramsay sent me to draw you a bath, my lady.	48	5	6
573	 You want to be clean and fresh	48	5	6
574	 for your new husband, don't you?	48	5	6
575	 You're so beautiful,	48	5	6
576	 but you need to keep him happy.	48	5	6
577	 Ramsay gets bored easily.	48	5	6
578	 You don't want to end up like--	48	5	6
579	 well, like the others.	48	5	6
580	 What others?	49	5	6
581	 I shouldn't gossip.	49	5	6
582	 Oh, it's good to see the red again.	49	5	6
583	 No point hiding anymore.	49	5	6
584	 What others?	49	5	6
585	 Let's see, there was Kyra	49	5	6
586	 the blacksmith's daughter.	49	5	6
587	 She was tall like you, lovely figure.	49	5	6
588	 But she talked and talked and talked	49	5	6
589	 and Ramsay grew tired of that.	49	5	6
590	 Then there was Violet.	49	5	6
591	 She had gorgeous blonde hair.	49	5	6
592	 But she got pregnant.	49	5	6
593	 And, well, that was boring.	49	5	6
594	 Then Tansy.	49	5	6
595	 Such a sweet girl.	49	5	6
596	 Of course, sweet girls get a bit dull	49	5	6
597	 after a while, don't they?	49	5	6
598	 Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt.	49	5	6
599	 Hunt?	50	5	6
600	 Mmm.	50	5	6
601	 Have you ever seen a body after the dogs have been at it?	50	5	6
602	 Not so pretty.	50	5	6
603	 But, well, it's your wedding day.	50	5	6
604	 Why am I talking about such things?	50	5	6
605	 What was your name again?	50	5	6
606	 Myranda.	50	5	6
607	 And how long have yo loved him, Myranda?	50	5	6
608	 Did you imagine that he would be with you forever, is that it?	50	5	6
609	 And I came along and ruined it.	50	5	6
610	 I'm Sansa Stark of Winterfell.	50	5	6
611	 This is my home and you can't frighten me.	50	5	6
612	 Are you done with your bath, my lady?	51	5	6
613	 Go. I can finish on my own.	51	5	6
614	 Yes?	51	5	6
615	 I've come to escort you to the godswood, my lady.	51	5	6
616	 If you please, my lady, will you take my arm?	51	5	6
617	 No.	52	5	6
618	 Lord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm.	52	5	6
619	 I'm not touching you.	52	5	6
620	 Please.	52	5	6
621	 He'll punish me.	52	5	6
622	 You think I care what he does to you?	52	5	6
623	 Who comes before the old gods this night?	53	5	6
624	 Sansa of the House Stark	53	5	6
625	 comes here to be wed.	53	5	6
626	 A woman grown, trueborn and noble.	53	5	6
627	 She comes to beg the blessings of the gods.	54	5	6
628	 Who comes to claim her?	54	5	6
629	 Ramsay of House Bolton.	54	5	6
630	 Heir to the Dreadfort and Winterfell.	54	5	6
631	 Who gives her?	54	5	6
632	 Theon of House Greyjoy, who was--	54	5	6
633	 who was her father's ward.	54	5	6
634	 Lady Sansa, will you take this man?	54	5	6
635	 I take this man.	55	5	6
636	 Are you pleased, my lady?	56	5	6
637	 Good. I want you to be happy.	56	5	6
638	 My father said you're still a virgin.	56	5	6
639	 - Uh, yes. - Why?	56	5	6
640	 Why are you still a virgin?	56	5	6
641	 Afraid of dwarves?	56	5	6
642	 Lord-- Lord Tyrion was kind.	56	5	6
643	 He was gentle. He never touched me.	56	5	6
644	 You're not lying to me?	56	5	6
645	 No, my lord.	56	5	6
646	 Lying to your husband on his wedding night,	57	5	6
647	 that would be a bad way to start a marriage.	57	5	6
648	 We're man and wife now.	57	5	6
649	 We should be honest with each other.	57	5	6
650	 Don't you think?	57	5	6
651	 Yes.	57	5	6
652	 Good.	57	5	6
653	 Take off your clothes.	57	5	6
654	 Oh, no, no, no.	57	5	6
655	 You stay here, Reek.	57	5	6
656	 You watch.	57	5	6
657	 Do I need to ask a second time?	58	5	6
658	 I hate asking a second time.	58	5	6
659	 Reek...	58	5	6
660	 I told you to watch.	58	5	6
661	 You've known Sansa since she was a girl.	58	5	6
662	 Now watch her become a woman.	59	5	6

2	 Look at me. Look at me!	2	1	10
3	 Do you remember me now, boy, eh?	2	1	10
4	 Remember me? There's a bright boy.	2	1	10
5	 You'll be coming with me, boy,	2	1	10
6	 and you'll be keeping your mouth shut.	2	1	10
7	 - Keep your mouth shut, boy. - I'm not a boy!	3	1	10
8	 You're not a smart boy, is that what you're trying to say?	3	1	10
9	 Do you want to live, boy?!	3	1	10
10	 North, boy, we're going north.	3	1	10
11	 It had three eyes.	3	1	10
12	 It told me to come with him, so I did.	4	1	10
13	 We went down into the crypts and my father was there.	4	1	10
14	 Your father's not down there, little lord.	4	1	10
15	 Not for many years yet.	4	1	10
16	 You're afraid-- just like Hodor.	4	1	10
17	 I'm not afraid of some hole in the ground.	4	1	10
18	 You've lived beyond the Wall. What are you scared of?	4	1	10
19	 I'm a crippled boy and I'm willing to go.	4	1	10
20	 That's my grandfather Lord Rickard.	4	1	10
21	 He was burned alive by the Mad King Aerys.	4	1	10
22	 That's Lyanna, my father's sister.	4	1	10
23	 King Robert was supposed to marry her,	4	1	10
24	 but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her.	4	1	10
25	 Robert started a war to win her back.	4	1	10
26	 He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway.	4	1	10
27	 That's where I saw father.	5	1	10
28	 You see? He's not here.	5	1	10
29	 -Here, Shaggydog. -Rickon!	5	1	10
30	 That beast	5	1	10
31	 is supposed to be chained in the kennels!	5	1	10
32	 - He doesn't like chains. - What are you doing down here?	5	1	10
33	 - Come back up with us. - No, I came to see father.	5	1	10
34	 How many times have I told you? He's in King's Landing	5	1	10
35	 with Sansa and Arya.	5	1	10
36	 He was down here. I saw him.	5	1	10
37	 Saw him when?	5	1	10
38	 Last night,	5	1	10
39	 when I was sleeping.	5	1	10
40	 Here, Shaggydog.	5	1	10
41	 You both miss him.	5	1	10
42	 It's only natural he should be in your thoughts	6	1	10
43	 and dreams, but that doesn't mean that--	6	1	10
44	 Bran...	6	1	10
45	 - My Lady. - My Lady.	6	1	10
46	 - My Lady. - My Lady.	6	1	10
47	 - My Lady. - My Lady.	6	1	10
48	 My Lady.	6	1	10
49	 Robb.	7	1	10
50	 Robb.	7	1	10
51	 Robb!	7	1	10
52	 You've ruined your sword.	7	1	10
53	 Shh shh.	8	1	10
54	 - Shh. - I'll kill them all--	8	1	10
55	 --Every one of them.	8	1	10
56	 I will kill them all.	8	1	10
57	 My boy.	8	1	10
58	 They have your sisters.	8	1	10
59	 We have to get the girls back.	8	1	10
60	 And then we will kill them all.	8	1	10
61	  the boar's great tusks, they boded ill 	8	1	10

72	  and 	9	1	10
73	  the boar did all the rest. 	9	1	10
74	 Very amusing.	10	1	10
75	 Isn't it a funny song?	10	1	10
76	 Thank you for your rendition.	10	1	10
77	 I imagine it was even better received at that tavern.	10	1	10
78	 I'm so sorry, Your Grace.	10	1	10
79	 I'll never sing it again, I swear.	10	1	10
80	 Tell me, which do you favor:	10	1	10
81	 Your fingers or your tongue?	10	1	10
82	 Your Grace?	10	1	10
83	 Fingers or your tongue?	10	1	10
84	 If you got to keep one, which would it be?	10	1	10
85	 I-- I--	10	1	10
86	 or I could just cut your throat.	10	1	10
87	 Every man needs hands, Your Grace.	10	1	10
88	 Good.	10	1	10
89	 - Tongue it is. - Your Grace, please.	10	1	10
90	 I won't sing-- Your Grace.	10	1	10
91	 Ser Ilyn, who better than you	10	1	10
92	 - to carry out the sentence? - I beg you!	10	1	10
93	 Please no.	10	1	10
94	 No!	11	1	10
95	 Your Grace, please. I beg you, I will never sing again!	11	1	10
96	 - I'm done for the day. - No-oooo!	11	1	10
97	 I'll leave the rest of the matters to you, mother.	11	1	10
98	 Your Grace, please!	11	1	10
99	 You look quite nice.	11	1	10
100	 Thank you, My Lord.	11	1	10
101	" ""Your Grace."" I'm King now."	11	1	10
102	 Stop-ppp! No!	11	1	10
103	 Walk with me. I want to show you something.	11	1	10
104	 Do as you're bid, child.	11	1	10
105	 ...And as soon as you've had your blood, I'll put a son in you.	11	1	10
106	 Mother says that shouldn't be long.	12	1	10
107	 No, please no!	12	1	10
108	 This one's your father.	12	1	10
109	 This one here.	12	1	10
110	 Look at it and see what happens to traitors.	12	1	10
111	 - You promised to be merciful. - I was.	12	1	10
112	 I gave him a clean death.	12	1	10
113	 Look at him.	12	1	10
114	 Please let me go home. I won't do any treason, I swear.	12	1	10
115	 Mother says I'm still to marry you. So you'll stay here	12	1	10
116	 and obey.	12	1	10
117	 Look at him!	12	1	10
118	 Well?	12	1	10
119	 How long do I have to look?	12	1	10
120	 As long as it pleases me.	13	1	10
121	 Do you want to see the rest?	13	1	10
122	 If it please Your Grace.	13	1	10
123	 That's your Septa there.	13	1	10
124	 I'll tell you what:	13	1	10
125	 I'm going to give you a present.	13	1	10
126	 After I raise my armies and kill your traitor brother,	13	1	10
127	 I'm going to give you his head as well.	13	1	10
128	 Or maybe he'll give me yours.	13	1	10
129	 My mother tells me a King should never strike his lady.	13	1	10
130	 Ser Meryn.	13	1	10
131	 Here, girl.	14	1	10
132	 Will you obey now?	14	1	10
133	 Or do you need another lesson?	14	1	10
134	 I'll look for you in court.	14	1	10
135	 Save yourself some pain, girl.	14	1	10
136	 Give him what he wants.	14	1	10
137	 You'll be needing that again.	14	1	10
138	 The proper course is clear:	15	1	10
139	 Pledge fealty to King Renly and move south	15	1	10
140	 to join our forces with his.	15	1	10
141	 Renly is not the King.	15	1	10
142	 You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, My Lord.	15	1	10
143	 He put your father to death.	15	1	10
144	 That doesn't make Renly King.	15	1	10
145	 He's Robert's youngest brother.	15	1	10
146	 If Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me,	15	1	10
147	 Renly can't be King before Stannis.	15	1	10
148	 Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?	15	1	10
149	 - Renly is not right! - My Lords.	15	1	10
150	 If we put ourselves behind Stannis--	15	1	10
151	 My Lords!	15	1	10
152	 Here is what I say to these two Kings--	15	1	10
153	 Renly Baratheon is nothing to me,	15	1	10
154	 nor Stannis neither.	15	1	10
155	 Why should they rule over me and mine	15	1	10
156	 from some flowery seat in the South?	15	1	10
157	 What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood?	16	1	10
158	 Even their Gods are wrong!	16	1	10
159	 Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again?	16	1	10
160	 It was the Dragons we bowed to	16	1	10
161	 and now the Dragons are dead!	16	1	10
162	 There sits the only King	16	1	10
163	 I mean to bend my knee to--	16	1	10
164	 the King in the North!	16	1	10
165	 I'll have peace on those terms.	16	1	10
166	 They can keep their Red Castle	16	1	10
167	 and their Iron Chair too.	16	1	10
168	 The King in the North!	16	1	10
169	 Am I your brother, now and always?	16	1	10
170	 Now and always.	17	1	10
171	 My sword is yours, in victory and defeat	17	1	10
172	 from this day until my last day.	17	1	10
173	 The King in the North!	17	1	10
174	 The King in the North! The King in the North!	17	1	10
175	 The King in the North!	17	1	10
176	 The King in the North! The King in the North!	17	1	10
177	 The King in the North!	17	1	10
178	 The King in the North!	17	1	10
179	 The King in the North!	17	1	10
180	 The King in the North!	17	1	10
181	 The King in the North! The King in the North!	17	1	10
182	 - Lady Stark. - I want to see him.	17	1	10
183	 Now!	17	1	10
184	 Leave us.	18	1	10
185	 You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark.	18	1	10
186	 Widowhood becomes you.	18	1	10
187	 Your bed must be lonely.	18	1	10
188	 Is that why you came?	18	1	10
189	 I'm not at my best,	18	1	10
190	 but I think I could be of service.	18	1	10
191	 You slip out of that gown and we'll see if I'm up to it.	18	1	10
192	 Oh, I do like a violent woman.	18	1	10
193	 I will kill you tonight, Ser,	18	1	10
194	 pack your head in a box and send it to your sister.	19	1	10
195	 Let me show you how--	19	1	10
196	 hit me again, over the ear.	19	1	10
197	 And again and again.	19	1	10
198	 You're stronger than you look-- it shouldn't take long.	19	1	10
199	 That is what you want the world to believe,	19	1	10
200	 isn't it? That you don't fear death.	19	1	10
201	 But I don't, My Lady.	19	1	10
202	 The dark is coming for all of us. Why cry about it?	19	1	10
203	 Because you are going to the deepest	19	1	10
204	 of the Seven Hells, if the Gods are just.	19	1	10
205	 What Gods are those?	19	1	10
206	 The trees your husband prayed to?	19	1	10
207	 Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off?	19	1	10
208	 If your Gods are real and if they are just,	19	1	10
209	 why is the world so full of injustice?	19	1	10
210	 Because of men like you.	19	1	10
211	 There are no men like me.	19	1	10
212	 Only me.	20	1	10
213	 My son Bran.	20	1	10
214	 How did he come to fall from that tower?	20	1	10
215	 I pushed him out the window.	20	1	10
216	 Why?	20	1	10
217	 I hoped the fall would kill him.	20	1	10
218	 Why?	20	1	10
219	 You should get some sleep.	20	1	10
220	 It's going to be a long war.	20	1	10
221	 I can't believe we're actually at war.	21	1	10
222	 Was it this exciting last time, when you were young?	21	1	10
223	 What does it say?	21	1	10
224	 Have we captured Robb Stark yet?	21	1	10
225	 - What's our next move? - Stop talking.	21	1	10
226	 Get back into bed.	21	1	10
227	 They have my son.	21	1	10
228	 The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.	21	1	10
229	 I've heard his wolf killed a doze men and as many horses.	21	1	10
230	 Is it true about Stannis and Renly?	22	1	10
231	 Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us.	22	1	10
232	 Jaime captured, his armies scattered...	22	1	10
233	 It's a catastrophe.	22	1	10
234	 Perhaps we should sue for peace.	22	1	10
235	 There's your peace.	22	1	10
236	 Joffrey saw to that when h decided to remove Ned Stark's head.	22	1	10
237	 You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup	22	1	10
238	 than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now.	22	1	10
239	 He's winning...	22	1	10
240	 in case you hadn't noticed.	22	1	10
241	 I'm told we still have his sisters.	22	1	10
242	 The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime.	22	1	10
243	 No truces. We can't afford to look weak.	22	1	10
244	 We should march on them at once.	22	1	10
245	 First we must return to Casterly Rock to raise--	22	1	10
246	 They have my son!	22	1	10
247	 Get out, all of you.	22	1	10
248	 Not you.	23	1	10
249	 You were right about Eddard Stark.	23	1	10
250	 If he were alive, we could have used him	23	1	10
251	 to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun,	23	1	10
252	 which would have given us more time	23	1	10
253	 to deal with Robert's brothers. But now...	23	1	10
254	 Madness-- madness and stupidity.	23	1	10
255	 I always thought you were a stunted fool.	23	1	10
256	 Perhaps I was wrong.	24	1	10
257	 Half wrong.	24	1	10
258	 I'm new to strategy, but--	24	1	10
259	 unless we want to be surrounded by three armies,	24	1	10
260	 it appears we can't stay here.	24	1	10
261	 No one will stay here.	24	1	10
262	 Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders	24	1	10
263	 and set the Riverland on fire from God's Eye to the Red Fork.	24	1	10
264	 The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal.	24	1	10
265	 And you will go to King's Landing.	24	1	10
266	 And do what?	24	1	10
267	 Rule!	24	1	10
268	 You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead.	24	1	10
269	 You will bring that boy King to heel and his mother too, if needs be.	24	1	10
270	 And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest:	24	1	10
271	 - Baelish, Varys, Pycelle-- - Heads, spikes, walls.	24	1	10
272	 Why not my Uncle?	24	1	10
273	 Why not anyone? Why me?	25	1	10
274	 You're my son.	25	1	10
275	 Oh, one more thing:	25	1	10
276	 You will not take the whore to court.	25	1	10
277	 Do you understand?	25	1	10
278	 Ser Jorah?	25	1	10
279	 Gently gently.	25	1	10
280	 My son...	26	1	10
281	 Where is he? I want him.	26	1	10
282	 Where is he?	26	1	10
283	 The boy did not live.	26	1	10
284	 - Tell me. - What is there to tell?	26	1	10
285	 How did my son die?!	26	1	10
286	 He never lived, My Princess.	26	1	10
287	 The women say...	26	1	10
288	 What do the women say?	26	1	10
289	 - They say the child was-- - Monstrous,	26	1	10
290	 twisted.	26	1	10
291	 I pulled him out myself.	26	1	10
292	 He was scaled like a lizard,	26	1	10
293	 blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat.	26	1	10
294	 When I touched him the skin fell from his bones.	26	1	10
295	 Inside he was full of graveworms.	27	1	10
296	 I warned you that only death can pay for life.	27	1	10
297	 You knew the price.	27	1	10
298	 Where is Khal Drogo?	27	1	10
299	 Show him to me.	27	1	10
300	 Show me what I bought	27	1	10
301	 with my son's life.	27	1	10
302	 As you command, lady.	27	1	10
303	 Come.	27	1	10
304	 I will take you to him.	27	1	10
305	 - Time enough for that later-- - I want to see him now.	27	1	10
306	 The Khalasar is gone.	27	1	10
307	 A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.	28	1	10
308	 The Dothraki follow only the strong.	28	1	10
309	 I'm sorry, My Princess.	28	1	10
310	 Drogo!	28	1	10
311	 Why is he out here alone?	28	1	10
312	 He seems to like the warmth, Princess.	28	1	10
313	 He lives.	28	1	10
314	 You asked for life, you paid for life.	28	1	10
315	 This is not life. When will he be as he was?	28	1	10
316	 When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east	28	1	10
317	 when the seas go dry.	28	1	10
318	 When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.	28	1	10
319	 Leave us.	29	1	10
320	 I don't want you alone with this sorceress.	29	1	10
321	 I have nothing more to fear from this woman.	29	1	10
322	 Go.	29	1	10
323	 You knew what I was buying and you knew the price.	29	1	10
324	 It was wrong of them to burn my temple.	29	1	10
325	 - It angered the Great Shepherd. - This is not God's work.	29	1	10
326	 - My child was innocent. - Innocent?	29	1	10
327	 He would have been the stallion who mounts the world.	29	1	10
328	 Now he will burn no cities.	29	1	10
329	 Now his Khalasar will trample no nations into dust.	29	1	10
330	 I spoke for you.	30	1	10
331	 I saved you.	30	1	10
332	 Saved me?	30	1	10
333	 Three of those riders had already	30	1	10
334	 raped me before you saved me, girl.	30	1	10
335	 I saw my God's house burn,	30	1	10
336	 there where I had healed men and women beyond counting.	30	1	10
337	 In the streets I saw piles of heads--	30	1	10
338	 the head of the Baker who makes my bread,	30	1	10
339	 the head of a young boy	30	1	10
340	 that I had cured of fever just three moons past.	30	1	10
341	 So tell me again exactly what it was	30	1	10
342	 that you saved.	30	1	10
343	 Your life.	30	1	10
344	 Hmph.	30	1	10
345	 Why don't you take a look at your Khal...	30	1	10
346	 Then you will see exactly what life is worth	30	1	10
347	 when all the rest has gone.	30	1	10
348	 You can't!	31	1	10
349	 Get out of my way, Sam.	31	1	10
350	 They'll put out the word.	31	1	10
351	 They'll send out ravens. People will come after you.	31	1	10
352	 Do you know what happens to deserters?	31	1	10
353	 Better than you do.	31	1	10
354	 What are you going to do?	31	1	10
355	 I'm gonna find my brother	31	1	10
356	 and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat.	31	1	10
357	 You can't leave us now. We need you here.	31	1	10
358	 - Move. - I won't let you go.	31	1	10
359	 - Move. - No.	31	1	10
360	 Hyah!	31	1	10
361	 Hand of the King?	32	1	10
362	 So it would seem.	32	1	10
363	 And your father said you couldn't take anyone with you to King's Landing.	32	1	10
364	 No, he said I couldn't take you with me to King's Landing.	32	1	10
365	 He was very specific on that point.	32	1	10
366	 He knew my name?	32	1	10
367	 What?	32	1	10
368	" He said, ""Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing""?"	32	1	10
369	" I believe he used the word ""whore."""	32	1	10
370	 Are you ashamed of me?	32	1	10
371	 Are you afraid that I'm dancing around the court with my tits out?	32	1	10
372	 I'm funny now?	32	1	10
373	 I'm Shae the funny whore.	32	1	10
374	 My father's probably the most powerful man in the country.	32	1	10
375	 Certainly the richest.	33	1	10
376	 He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets.	33	1	10
377	 Everyone everywhere	33	1	10
378	 always has to do exactly what my father says.	33	1	10
379	 He's always been a cunt.	33	1	10
380	 I believe the ladies of the court	33	1	10
381	 could learn a great deal from a girl like you.	33	1	10
382	 Why don't you come with me,	33	1	10
383	 be the Hand's lady?	33	1	10
384	 Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand--	33	1	10
385	 I know what a Hand needs.	33	1	10
386	 - Ghost? - Hyah!	34	1	10
387	 - Hyah. - Hyah!	34	1	10
388	 Hyah.	34	1	10
389	 Samwell!	34	1	10
390	 - Is he dead? - No, he's not dead.	34	1	10
391	 Did we get him?	34	1	10
392	 Come on, help me get him up.	34	1	10
393	 Lucky you've got plenty of padding.	34	1	10
394	 We're taking you back to where you belong.	34	1	10
395	 - I belong with my brother. - But we're your brothers now.	34	1	10
396	 They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.	34	1	10
397	 They'll kill you if they know you came after me.	34	1	10
398	 - Go back. - Sam told us everything.	34	1	10
399	 - We're sorry about your father. - But it doesn't matter.	34	1	10
400	 You took the oath. You can't leave.	34	1	10
401	 - I have to. - You can't.	35	1	10
402	 - You said the words. - I don't care about--	35	1	10
403	" ""Hear my words and bear witness to my vow..."""	35	1	10
404	 To hell with all of you.	35	1	10
405	" ""Night gathers and now my Watch begins."	35	1	10
406	 It shall not end until my death.	35	1	10
407	" I shall live and die at my post."""	35	1	10
408	" ""I am the sword in the darkness..."""	35	1	10
409	" ""...The Watcher on the Walls,"	35	1	10
410	 the shield that guards the realms of men.	35	1	10
411	 I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch,	35	1	10
412	" for this night and all nights to come."""	35	1	10
413	 When the sun	37	1	10
414	 rises in the west	37	1	10
415	 and sets in the east...	37	1	10
416	 Then you shall return to me, my sun and stars.	37	1	10
417	 Kings?	39	1	10
418	 Oh, I can tell you all there is to know about Kings.	39	1	10
419	 The thing you need to understand about Kings is...	39	1	10
420	 For the past 67 years, I've known--	39	1	10
421	 truly known more Kings than any man alive.	39	1	10
422	 They're complicated men, but I know how to serve them.	39	1	10
423	 Yes.	39	1	10
424	 And keep on serving them.	39	1	10
425	 Aerys Targaryen...	39	1	10
426	 of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us,	39	1	10
427	 madness is the worst.	40	1	10
428	 He was a good man,	40	1	10
429	 such a charmer.	40	1	10
430	 To watch him melt away before my eyes,	40	1	10
431	 consumed by dreams	40	1	10
432	 of fire and blood...	40	1	10
433	 Robert Baratheon	40	1	10
434	 was an entirely different animal-- powerful man,	40	1	10
435	 a great warrior--	40	1	10
436	 but alas, winning a Kingdom	40	1	10
437	 and ruling a Kingdom are rather different things.	40	1	10
438	 They say that	40	1	10
439	 if a man goes through life with his battle visor down,	40	1	10
440	 he can often be blind	40	1	10
441	 to the enemies at his side.	40	1	10
442	 Now I serve his son	41	1	10
443	 King Joffrey,	41	1	10
444	 may the Gods bless his reign.	41	1	10
445	 He is a capable young man-- strong military mind.	41	1	10
446	 Stern...	41	1	10
447	 But sternness in defense of the realm is no vice.	41	1	10
448	 It's far too soon to know what manner of King he will be,	41	1	10
449	 but I sense	41	1	10
450	 true greatness on the horizon for our new King.	41	1	10
451	 True greatness.	41	1	10
452	 So what's the thing?	41	1	10
453	 What thing?	41	1	10
454	 About Kings.	41	1	10
455	" You said, ""the thing you need to understand about Kings..."""	41	1	10
456	 What? Things? What?	42	1	10
457	 When you started, you-- never mind.	42	1	10
458	 Let me see you out, my dear.	42	1	10
459	 - It's all right. No need. - Yes yes.	42	1	10
460	 Till the next time.	42	1	10
461	 Right.	42	1	10
462	 When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look?	43	1	10
463	 Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies	43	1	10
464	 simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?	43	1	10
465	 It's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.	43	1	10
466	 A man with great ambition and no morals--	43	1	10
467	 I wouldn't bet against you.	43	1	10
468	 And what would you do, my friend,	43	1	10
469	 if you found yourself sitting up there?	43	1	10
470	 I must be one of the few men in this city	43	1	10
471	 who doesn't want to be King.	43	1	10
472	 You must be one of the few men in the city	43	1	10
473	 who isn't a man.	43	1	10
474	 Oh, you can do better than that.	43	1	10
475	 When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones?	44	1	10
476	 - I've always wondered. - Have you?	44	1	10
477	 Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?	44	1	10
478	 I picture a gash	44	1	10
479	 like a woman's. Is that about right?	44	1	10
480	 I am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all.	44	1	10
481	 Must be strange for you, even after all these years--	44	1	10
482	 a man from another land,	44	1	10
483	 despised by most,	44	1	10
484	 feared by all--	44	1	10
485	 am I? That is good to know.	44	1	10
486	 Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?	44	1	10
487	 But you carry on, whispering in one King's ear	44	1	10
488	 and then the next.	44	1	10
489	 I admire you.	44	1	10
490	 And I admire you, Lord Baelish.	44	1	10
491	 A grasper from a minor house with a major talent	44	1	10
492	 for befriending powerful men--	44	1	10
493	 and women.	45	1	10
494	 A useful talent, I'm sure you'd agree.	45	1	10
495	 So here we stand...	45	1	10
496	 In mutual admiration and respect.	45	1	10
497	 Playing our roles.	45	1	10
498	 Serving a new King.	45	1	10
499	 Long may he reign.	45	1	10
500	 - My King. - My King.	45	1	10
501	 My Lords. Shall we begin?	45	1	10
502	 You're Arry now, hear me?	45	1	10
503	 Arry the orphan boy.	45	1	10
504	 No one asks an orphan too many questions	45	1	10
505	 'cause nobody gives three shits.	45	1	10
506	 What's your name?	45	1	10
507	 - Arry. - Ah.	45	1	10
508	 We have a long way to travel and in bad company.	45	1	10
509	 I have 20 this time,	45	1	10
510	 men and boys all bound for the Wall.	45	1	10
511	 Your Lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons	45	1	10
512	 and I didn't find no little lordlings down there.	45	1	10
513	 This lot, half of them would turn you over to the King	46	1	10
514	 quick as spit for a pardon.	46	1	10
515	 And the other half would do the same,	46	1	10
516	 except they'd rape you first.	46	1	10
517	 So keep to yourself-- and when you piss,	46	1	10
518	 do it in the woods alone.	46	1	10
519	 You stay with this lot, boy.	46	1	10
520	 And stay--	46	1	10
521	 or I'll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three.	46	1	10
522	 Watch yourself, midget.	46	1	10
523	 He's got a sword, this one.	46	1	10
524	 What's a gutter rat like you doing with a sword?	46	1	10
525	 - Maybe he's a little squire. - He ain't no squire. Look at him.	46	1	10
526	 He looks like a girl.	46	1	10
527	 I bet he stole that sword.	46	1	10
528	 Let's have a look.	46	1	10
529	 I could use me a sword like that.	46	1	10
530	 - Take it off him. - Give it here, midget.	46	1	10
531	 Look at him!	47	1	10
532	 You'd better give Hot Pie the sword.	47	1	10
533	 I've seen him kick a boy to death.	47	1	10
534	 I knocked him down and I kicked him in the balls	47	1	10
535	 and I kept kicking him until he was dead.	47	1	10
536	 I kicked him all to pieces.	47	1	10
537	 - You better give me that sword! - You want it?	47	1	10
538	 I'll give it to you.	47	1	10
539	 I already killed one fat boy.	47	1	10
540	 I bet you never killed anyone.	47	1	10
541	 I bet you're a liar. But I'm not.	47	1	10
542	 I'm good at killing fat boys.	47	1	10
543	 I like killing fat boys.	47	1	10
544	 Oh, you like picking on the little ones, do you?	47	1	10
545	 You know, I've been hammering an anvil these past 10 years.	47	1	10
546	 When I hit that steel, it sings.	47	1	10
547	 Are you gonna sing when I hit you?	47	1	10
548	 This is castle-forged steel.	47	1	10
549	 Where'd you steal it?	47	1	10
550	 - It was a gift. - It don't matter now.	48	1	10
551	 Where we're going, they don't care what you've done.	48	1	10
552	 They've got rapers, pickpockets, highwaymen--	48	1	10
553	 murderers.	48	1	10
554	 - Which are you? - Armorer's apprentice.	48	1	10
555	 But my master got sick of me,	48	1	10
556	 so here I am.	48	1	10
557	 Come on, you sorry sons of whores!	48	1	10
558	 It's a thousand leagues from here to the Wall	48	1	10
559	 and winter is coming!	48	1	10
560	 Ham.	49	1	10
561	 How many days in a row must a man be	49	1	10
562	 expected to start his day with ham?	49	1	10
563	 Bring me some beer at least.	49	1	10
564	 You look exhausted.	49	1	10
565	 Was your moonlight ride that tiring?	49	1	10
566	 Don't look so terrified.	49	1	10
567	 If we beheaded everyone that ran away for the night,	49	1	10
568	 only ghosts would guard the Wall.	49	1	10
569	 At least you weren't whoring in Mole's Town.	49	1	10
570	 Honor made you leave,	49	1	10
571	 honor brought you back.	49	1	10
572	 My friends brought me back.	49	1	10
573	 I didn't say it was your honor.	49	1	10
574	 They killed my father.	49	1	10
575	 And you're going to bring him back to life, are you?	49	1	10
576	 No? Good.	50	1	10
577	 We've had enough of that sort of thing.	50	1	10
578	 Beyond the Wall, the rangers are	50	1	10
579	 reporting whole villages abandoned.	50	1	10
580	 At night they see fires blazing in the mountains	50	1	10
581	 from dusk until dawn.	50	1	10
582	 A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold,	50	1	10
583	 to what ends the Gods only know.	50	1	10
584	 Outside Eastwatch	50	1	10
585	 Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blue-eyed corpses.	50	1	10
586	 Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them.	50	1	10
587	 Do you think your brother's war	50	1	10
588	 is more important than ours?	50	1	10
589	 - No. - When dead men and worse	50	1	10
590	 come hunting for us in the night, do you think it matters	50	1	10
591	 who sits on the Iron Throne?	51	1	10
592	 - No. - Good.	51	1	10
593	 Because I want you and your wolf with us	51	1	10
594	 when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow.	51	1	10
595	 Beyond the Wall?	51	1	10
596	 I'll not sit meekly by	51	1	10
597	 and wait for the snows.	51	1	10
598	 I mean to find out what's happening.	51	1	10
599	 The Night's Watch will ride in force	51	1	10
600	 against the wildlings, the White Walkers	51	1	10
601	 and whatever else is out there.	51	1	10
602	 And we will find Benjen Stark,	51	1	10
603	 alive or dead.	51	1	10
604	 I will command them myself.	51	1	10
605	 So I'll only ask you once, Lord Snow...	51	1	10
606	 Move out!	51	1	10
607	 ...Are you a brother of the Night's Watch	51	1	10
608	 or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?	51	1	10
609	 Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands.	52	1	10
610	 Sell them. You can return to the Free Cities	52	1	10
611	 and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.	52	1	10
612	 They were not given to me to sell.	52	1	10
613	 Khaleesi, My Queen,	53	1	10
614	 I vow to serve you, obey you,	53	1	10
615	 to die for you if need be,	53	1	10
616	 but let him go, Khaleesi.	53	1	10
617	 I know what you intend. Do not.	53	1	10
618	 I must.	53	1	10
619	 You don't understand--	53	1	10
620	 don't ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre.	53	1	10
621	 I won't watch you burn.	53	1	10
622	 Is that what you fear?	53	1	10
623	 You will be my Khalasar.	54	1	10
624	 I see the faces of slaves.	54	1	10
625	 I free you.	54	1	10
626	 Take off your collars. Go if yo wish, no one will stop you.	54	1	10
627	 But if you stay,	54	1	10
628	 it will be as brothers and sisters,	54	1	10
629	 as husbands and wives.	54	1	10
630	 Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre.	54	1	10
631	 You swore to obey me.	54	1	10
632	 I am Daenerys Stormborn	54	1	10
633	 of House Targaryen	55	1	10
634	 of the blood of Old Valyria.	55	1	10
635	 I am the Dragon's daughter.	55	1	10
636	 And I swear to you	55	1	10
637	 that those who would harm you will die screaming.	55	1	10
638	 You will not hear me scream.	55	1	10
639	 I will.	55	1	10
640	 But it is not your screams I want.	55	1	10
641	 Only your life.	55	1	10
642	 Blood of my blood.	58	1	10
643		59	1	10
644		0	1	10
0	 Despite appearances, I think you'll find the city's on the rise.	2	6	9
1	 Perhaps we should take shelter.	2	6	9
2	 The city's on the rise?	2	6	9
3	 Meereen is strong.	2	6	9
4	 Commerce has returned to the markets.	2	6	9
5	 The people are behind you.	2	6	9
6	 Well, not all the people, of course.	2	6	9
7	 No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people.	2	6	9
8	 But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence.	2	6	9
9	 The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed.	3	6	9
10	 Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery,	3	6	9
11	 a city without Masters...	3	6	9
12	 ...it proves that no one needs a Master.	3	6	9
13	 Good.	3	6	9
14	 Shall we begin?	3	6	9
15	 Do we have a plan?	3	6	9
16	 I will crucify the Masters.	3	6	9
17	 I will set their fleets afire,	3	6	9
18	 kill every last one of their soldiers,	3	6	9
19	 and return their cities to the dirt.	3	6	9
20	 That is my plan.	3	6	9
21	 You don't approve?	3	6	9
22	 You once told me you knew what your father was.	3	6	9
23	 Did you know his plans for King's Landing	3	6	9
24	 when the Lannister armies were at his gates?	3	6	9
25	 Probably not.	3	6	9
26	 Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me.	3	6	9
27	 He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep,	3	6	9
28	 the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor,	3	6	9
29	 all the major thoroughfares.	3	6	9
30	 He would have burned every one of his citizens.	4	6	9
31	 The loyal ones and the traitors.	4	6	9
32	 Every man, woman, and child.	4	6	9
33	 That's why Jaime killed him.	4	6	9
34	 This is entirely different.	4	6	9
35	 You're talking about destroying cities.	4	6	9
36	 It's not entirely different.	4	6	9
37	 I'd like to suggest an alternate approach.	4	6	9
38	 Once before, I offered you peace.	4	6	9
39	 If you had not been so arrogant,	4	6	9
40	 you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships.	4	6	9
41	 Instead, you will flee Slaver's Bay on foot	4	6	9
42	 like the beggar queen you are.	4	6	9
43	 We are here to discuss terms of surrender,	4	6	9
44	 not to trade insults.	4	6	9
45	 The terms are simple.	5	6	9
46	 You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen.	5	6	9
47	 The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz	5	6	9
48	 will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder.	5	6	9
49	 The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain	5	6	9
50	 to be sold again to the highest bidder.	5	6	9
51	 The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.	5	6	9
52	 We obviously didn't communicate clearly.	5	6	9
53	 We're here to discuss your surrender, not mine.	5	6	9
54	 I imagine it's difficult	5	6	9
55	 adjusting to the new reality.	5	6	9
56	 Your reign is over.	5	6	9
57	 My reign has just begun.	5	6	9
58	 Dracarys.	8	6	9
59	 Your men have a choice:	9	6	9
60	 fight and die for masters who would never fight and die for you,	9	6	9
61	 or go home to your families.	9	6	9
62	 Thank you for the armada.	9	6	9
63	 Our queen does love ships.	9	6	9
64	 Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact.	9	6	9
65	 You violated that pact.	9	6	9
66	 You declared war upon us.	9	6	9
67	 Though our queen does have a forgiving nature,	9	6	9
68	 this cannot be forgiven.	9	6	9
69	 Our queen insists that one of you must die	9	6	9
70	 as punishment for your crimes.	9	6	9
71	 It always seems a bit abstract, doesn't it,	9	6	9
72	 other people dying?	10	6	9
73	 Him. He should die.	10	6	9
74	 Yes, him. He's not one of us.	10	6	9
75	 He's an outsider, a lowborn.	10	6	9
76	 He does not speak for us.	10	6	9
77	 Please.	10	6	9
78	 Please.	10	6	9
79	 Tell your people what happened here.	10	6	9
80	 Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty.	10	6	9
81	 When they come forward with notions of retribution	10	6	9
82	 or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory,	10	6	9
83	 remind them what happened	10	6	9
84	 when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen.	10	6	9
85	 You don't have to be here.	11	6	9
86	 Yes, I do.	11	6	9
87	 My beloved wife.	12	6	9
88	 I've missed you terribly.	12	6	9
89	 Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely.	12	6	9
90	 Now, dismount and kneel before me,	12	6	9
91	 surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.	12	6	9
92	 I will pardon you for deserting the Night's Watch.	12	6	9
93	 I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house.	12	6	9
94	 Come, bastard,	12	6	9
95	 you don't have the men, you don't have the horses,	12	6	9
96	 and you don't have Winterfell.	12	6	9
97	 Why lead those poor souls into slaughter?	12	6	9
98	 There's no need for a battle.	12	6	9
99	 Get off your horse and kneel.	12	6	9
100	 I'm a man of mercy.	12	6	9
101	 You're right.	13	6	9
102	 There's no need for a battle.	13	6	9
103	 Thousands of men don't need to die.	13	6	9
104	 Only one of us.	13	6	9
105	 Let's end this the old way.	13	6	9
106	 You against me.	13	6	9
107	 I keep hearing stories about you, bastard.	13	6	9
108	 The way people in the North talk about you,	13	6	9
109	 you're the greatest swordsman who ever walked.	13	6	9
110	 Maybe you are that good.	13	6	9
111	 Maybe not.	13	6	9
112	 I don't know if I'd beat you.	13	6	9
113	 But I know that my army will beat yours.	13	6	9
114	 I have 6,000 men.	13	6	9
115	 You have, what, half that?	13	6	9
116	 Not even?	13	6	9
117	 Aye, you have the numbers.	13	6	9
118	 Will your men want to fight for you	14	6	9
119	 when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?	14	6	9
120	 He's good. Very good.	14	6	9
121	 Tell me, will you let your little brother die	14	6	9
122	 because you're too proud to surrender?	14	6	9
123	 How do we know you have him?	14	6	9
124	 Now, if you want to save...	14	6	9
125	 You're going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton.	14	6	9
126	 Sleep well.	14	6	9
127	 She's a fine woman, your sister.	15	6	9
128	 I look forward to having her back in my bed.	15	6	9
129	 And you're all fine-looking men.	15	6	9
130	 My dogs are desperate to meet you.	15	6	9
131	 I haven't fed them for seven days. They're ravenous.	15	6	9
132	 I wonder which parts they'll try first.	15	6	9
133	 Your eyes?	15	6	9
134	 Your balls?	15	6	9
135	 We'll find out soon enough.	15	6	9
136	 In the morning, then, bastard.	15	6	9
137	 If he was smart, he'd stay inside	15	6	9
138	 the walls of Winterfell and wait us out.	16	6	9
139	 That's not his way. He knows the North is watching.	16	6	9
140	 If the other houses sense weakness on his part,	16	6	9
141	 they'll stop fearing him.	16	6	9
142	 He can't have that. Fear is his power.	16	6	9
143	 It's his weakness, too. His men don't want to fight for him.	16	6	9
144	 They're forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning...	16	6	9
145	 It's not his men that worry me.	16	6	9
146	 It's his horses.	16	6	9
147	 I know what mounted knights can do to us.	16	6	9
148	 You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.	16	6	9
149	 We're digging trenches all along our flanks.	16	6	9
150	 They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you,	16	6	9
151	 in a double envelopment.	16	6	9
152	 A pincer move.	16	6	9
153	 They won't be able to hit us from the sides.	16	6	9
154	 Good.	16	6	9
155	 It's crucial that we let them charge at us.	16	6	9
156	 They've got the numbers, we need the patience.	16	6	9
157	 If we let him buckle our center, he'll pursue.	17	6	9
158	 Then we'll have him surrounded on three sides.	17	6	9
159	 Did you really think that cunt would fight you man-to-man?	17	6	9
160	 No.	17	6	9
161	 But I wanted to make him angry.	17	6	9
162	 I want him coming at us full tilt.	17	6	9
163	 We should all get some sleep.	17	6	9
164	 Rest, Jon Snow. We need you sharp tomorrow.	17	6	9
165	 So you've met the enemy,	17	6	9
166	 drawn up your battle plans.	17	6	9
167	 Aye, for what they're worth.	17	6	9
168	 You've known him for the space of a single conversation,	17	6	9
169	 you and your trusted advisors,	17	6	9
170	 and you sit around making your plans	17	6	9
171	 on how to defeat a man you don't know.	17	6	9
172	 I lived with him.	18	6	9
173	 I know the way his mind works.	18	6	9
174	 I know how he likes to hurt people.	18	6	9
175	 Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?	18	6	9
176	 You're right.	18	6	9
177	 You think he's going to fall into your trap.	18	6	9
178	 He won't. He's the one who lays traps.	18	6	9
179	 - He's overconfident. - He plays with people.	18	6	9
180	 He's far better at it than you. He's been doing it all his life.	18	6	9
181	 Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks?	18	6	9
182	 I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton.	18	6	9
183	 I've defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton.	18	6	9
184	 You don't know him.	18	6	9
185	 All right, tell me.	18	6	9
186	 What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?	18	6	9
187	 We'll never get him back.	18	6	9
188	 Rickon is Ned Stark's trueborn son,	18	6	9
189	 which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay	18	6	9
190	 than you, a bastard, or me, a girl.	18	6	9
191	 As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim to Winterfell will be contested,	18	6	9
192	 which means he won't live long.	19	6	9
193	 We can't give up on our brother.	19	6	9
194	 Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake.	19	6	9
195	 Of course he does. What should I do differently?	19	6	9
196	 I don't know! I don't know anything about battles.	19	6	9
197	 Just don't do what he wants you to do.	19	6	9
198	 Aye, that's good advice.	19	6	9
199	 You think that's obvious?	19	6	9
200	 Well, it is a bit obvious.	19	6	9
201	 If you had asked for my advice earlier,	19	6	9
202	 I would have told you not to attack Winterfell	19	6	9
203	 until we had a larger force, or is that obvious, too?	19	6	9
204	 When will we have a larger force?!	19	6	9
205	 We've pleaded with every house that'll have us.	19	6	9
206	 The Blackfish can't help us.	19	6	9
207	 We're lucky to have this many men.	19	6	9
208	 - It's not enough! - No, it's not enough. It's what we have!	19	6	9
209	 Battles have been won against greater odds.	19	6	9
210	 If Ramsay wins,	19	6	9
211	 I'm not going back there alive.	19	6	9
212	 Do you understand me?	19	6	9
213	 I won't let ever let him touch you again.	20	6	9
214	 I'll protect you, I promise.	20	6	9
215	 No one can protect me.	20	6	9
216	 No one can protect anyone.	20	6	9
217	 You think there's hope?	20	6	9
218	 I've never seen these Bolton fuckers fight.	20	6	9
219	 And they've never seen the free folk fight,	20	6	9
220	 so, yes, there's hope.	20	6	9
221	 You want to avenge your king, don't you?	20	6	9
222	 It wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis.	20	6	9
223	 It was Stannis himself.	20	6	9
224	 I loved the man.	20	6	9
225	 He lifted me up and made me something.	20	6	9
226	 But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.	21	6	9
227	 - You saw these demons? - What?	21	6	9
228	 No, it's a manner of speaking.	21	6	9
229	 Not... actual demons.	21	6	9
230	 Well, you loved that cunt Stannis	21	6	9
231	 and I loved the man he burned.	21	6	9
232	 Mance didn't have demons in his skull.	21	6	9
233	 He didn't torch people or listen to some red witch.	21	6	9
234	 I believed in him.	21	6	9
235	 I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night.	21	6	9
236	 But I was wrong just like you.	21	6	9
237	 Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings.	21	6	9
238	 Jon Snow's not a king.	21	6	9
239	 No, he's not.	21	6	9
240	 I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight.	21	6	9
241	 You want some?	21	6	9
242	 I have a jug of sour goat's milk	21	6	9
243	 stronger than any of that grape water	22	6	9
244	 you southern twats like sucking on.	22	6	9
245	 No, thanks. It does sound delicious,	22	6	9
246	 but I better keep a clear head.	22	6	9
247	 I can never sleep the night before a battle.	22	6	9
248	 So what do you do all night?	22	6	9
249	 I walk.	22	6	9
250	 Think and walk.	22	6	9
251	 Think and walk until I'm far enough away from camp	22	6	9
252	 that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.	22	6	9
253	 Happy shitting.	22	6	9
254	 My lady.	22	6	9
255	 You weren't at the war council.	22	6	9
256	 I'm not a soldier.	22	6	9
257	 Any advice?	22	6	9
258	 Don't lose.	22	6	9
259	 If I do, if I fall...	23	6	9
260	 don't bring me back.	23	6	9
261	 I'll have to try.	23	6	9
262	 I'm ordering you not to bring me back.	23	6	9
263	 I am not your servant, Jon Snow.	23	6	9
264	 You're in my camp. I'm the commander.	23	6	9
265	 I serve the Lord of Light.	23	6	9
266	 I do what he commands.	23	6	9
267	 How do you know what he commands?	23	6	9
268	 I interpret his signs...	23	6	9
269	 as well as I can.	23	6	9
270	 If the Lord didn't want me to bring you back,	23	6	9
271	 how did I bring you back?	23	6	9
272	 I have no power.	23	6	9
273	 Only what he gives me and he gave me you.	23	6	9
274	 Why?	23	6	9
275	 I don't know.	23	6	9
276	 Maybe you're only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else.	23	6	9
277	 Maybe he brought you here to die again.	24	6	9
278	 What kind of god would do something like that?	24	6	9
279	 The one we've got.	24	6	9
280	 Game of Thrones 6x09 - The Battle of Bastards.	25	6	9
281	 Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes?	26	6	9
282	 You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall.	26	6	9
283	 Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height	26	6	9
284	 thinks he's the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height.	26	6	9
285	" ""The height of nobility,"" ""a man of your stature,"""	26	6	9
286	" ""someone to look up to."""	26	6	9
287	 You're all making the same five or six jokes.	26	6	9
288	 - It was a long time ago. - It was.	26	6	9
289	 And how have things been going for you since then?	26	6	9
290	 Not so well, I gather.	26	6	9
291	 Can't imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well.	26	6	9
292	 I didn't murder the Stark boys.	26	6	9
293	 But I did things that were just as bad or worse.	26	6	9
294	 And he paid for them.	26	6	9
295	 Doesn't seem like it.	26	6	9
296	 He's still alive.	26	6	9
297	 It was complicated for you, I'm sure,	26	6	9
298	 growing up at Winterfell.	26	6	9
299	 Never quite knowing who you were.	26	6	9
300	 But then, we all live complicated lives, don't we?	27	6	9
301	 You've brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet	27	6	9
302	 with men to sail them.	27	6	9
303	 In return, I expect you want me to support	27	6	9
304	 your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?	27	6	9
305	 Not my claim. Hers.	27	6	9
306	 And what's wrong with you?	27	6	9
307	 I'm not fit to rule.	27	6	9
308	 We can agree upon that at least.	27	6	9
309	 Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?	27	6	9
310	 No more than Westeros.	27	6	9
311	 Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence.	27	6	9
312	 He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from Yara.	27	6	9
313	 He would have murdered us if we'd stayed.	27	6	9
314	 Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.	27	6	9
315	 You and I have that in common.	27	6	9
316	 We do.	27	6	9
317	 And both murdered by a usurper as well.	27	6	9
318	 Will their ships be enough?	27	6	9
319	 With the former Masters' fleet, possibly.	27	6	9
320	 Barely.	27	6	9
321	 There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet.	27	6	9
322	 There are and Euron is building more.	28	6	9
323	 He's going to offer them to you.	28	6	9
324	 So why shouldn't I wait for him?	28	6	9
325	 The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing.	28	6	9
326	 He also wants to give you...	28	6	9
327	 His big cock, I think he said.	28	6	9
328	 Euron's offer is also an offer of marriage, you see.	28	6	9
329	 You won't get one without the other.	28	6	9
330	 And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?	28	6	9
331	 I never demand, but I'm up for anything, really.	28	6	9
332	 He murdered our father and would have murdered us.	28	6	9
333	 He'll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.	28	6	9
334	 The Seven Kingdoms.	28	6	9
335	 All of them.	28	6	9
336	 And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?	28	6	9
337	 Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands.	28	6	9
338	 We ask you to give them back.	28	6	9
339	 And that's all?	28	6	9
340	 We'd like you to help us murder an uncle or two	28	6	9
341	 who don't think a woman's fit to rule.	28	6	9
342	 Reasonable.	28	6	9
343	 What if everyone starts demanding their independence?	28	6	9
344	 She's not demanding, she's asking.	28	6	9
345	 The others are free to ask as well.	28	6	9
346	 Our fathers were evil men, all of us here.	29	6	9
347	 They left the world worse than they found it.	29	6	9
348	 We're not going to do that.	29	6	9
349	 We're going to leave the world better than we found it.	29	6	9
350	 You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms	29	6	9
351	 and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms.	29	6	9
352	 No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping.	29	6	9
353	 That's our way of life.	29	6	9
354	 No more.	29	6	9
355	 No more.	29	6	9
356	 Do you like games, little man?	33	6	9
357	 Let's play a game.	33	6	9
358	 Run to your brother.	33	6	9
359	 The sooner you make it to him,	33	6	9
360	 the sooner you get to see him again.	33	6	9
361	 That's it.	33	6	9
362	 That's the game.	33	6	9
363	 Easy.	33	6	9
364	 Ready?	33	6	9
365	 Go.	33	6	9
366	 No, you have to run, remember?	33	6	9
367	 Those are the rules.	34	6	9
368	 `T`U`S`U`B`T`I`T`U`L`O`C`O`M	35	6	9
369	 Don't.	36	6	9
370	 Prepare to charge.	36	6	9
371	 Prepare to charge!	36	6	9
372	 - Draw! - Draw!	36	6	9
373	 Draw!	36	6	9
374	 Loose!	36	6	9
375	 Go! Go! Follow your commander!	36	6	9
376	 Run and fight!	36	6	9
377	 Nock!	37	6	9
378	 - Draw! - Draw!	37	6	9
379	 - Loose! - Loose!	37	6	9
380	 Now.	37	6	9
381	 Cavalry, charge!	37	6	9
382	 - Nock! - Nock!	38	6	9
383	 - Nock! - Nock!	38	6	9
384	 - Draw! - Draw!	38	6	9
385	 - Draw! - Draw!	38	6	9
386	 We'll just kill our own men. Stand down.	38	6	9
387	 - Loose! - Loose!	38	6	9
388	 Get word...	39	6	9
389	 No!	39	6	9
390	 Loose!	40	6	9
391	 - Loose! - Loose!	40	6	9
392	 - Loose! - Loose!	40	6	9
393	 We may as well be taking shits back here.	41	6	9
394	 Follow!	41	6	9
395	 It's time, go.	41	6	9
396	 - Who owns the North? - We do!	41	6	9
397	 - Who owns the North? - We do!	41	6	9
398	 Show me!	41	6	9
399	 Hey!	41	6	9
400	 Infantry, advance!	42	6	9
401	 With me, lads! Break their line!	43	6	9
402	 Help me!	44	6	9
403	 - Tormund! - Get him back!	44	6	9
404	 Infantry, advance.	44	6	9
405	 Both sides!	44	6	9
406	 Fall back!	44	6	9
407	 Fall back!	44	6	9
408	 Fuck this, come on!	45	6	9
409	 We're going home!	45	6	9
410	 Open the gate!	49	6	9
411	 Archers to the wall.	49	6	9
412	 - Their army's gone. - Our army's gone.	49	6	9
413	 We have Winterfell.	49	6	9
414	 They don't have the men for a siege. All we have to do is wait.	50	6	9
415	 Archers!	50	6	9
416	 To the wall!	50	6	9
417	 You suggested one-on-one combat, didn't you?	51	6	9
418	 I've reconsidered.	51	6	9
419	 I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.	51	6	9
420	 We're going to bury my brother in the crypt	53	6	9
421	 next to my father.	54	6	9
422	 Jon.	54	6	9
423	 Where is he?	54	6	9
424	 Sansa.	54	6	9
425	 Hello, Sansa.	54	6	9
426	 Is this where I'll be staying now?	55	6	9
427	 No.	55	6	9
428	 Our time together is about to come to an end.	55	6	9
429	 That's all right.	55	6	9
430	 You can't kill me.	55	6	9
431	 I'm part of you now.	55	6	9
432	 Your words will disappear.	55	6	9
433	 Your house will disappear.	55	6	9
434	 Your name will disappear.	55	6	9
435	 All memory of you will disappear.	55	6	9
436	 My hounds will never harm me.	56	6	9
437	 You haven't fed them in seven days.	56	6	9
438	 You said it yourself.	56	6	9
439	 They're loyal beasts.	56	6	9
440	 They were.	56	6	9
441	 Now they're starving.	56	6	9
442	 Sit.	57	6	9
443	 Down.	57	6	9
444	 Down!	57	6	9
445	 Down! Down!	57	6	9
446	 Down!	57	6	9

37	 Looks fresh-forged.	5	4	1
38	 It is.	5	4	1
39	 No one's made a Valyrian steel sword	5	4	1
40	 since the Doom of Valyria.	6	4	1
41	 There are three living smiths	6	4	1
42	 who know how to rework Valyrian steel.	6	4	1
43	 The finest of them was in Volantis.	6	4	1
44	 Came here to King's Landing at my invitation.	6	4	1
45	 Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?	6	4	1
46	 From someone who no longer had need of it.	6	4	1
47	 You've wanted one of these in the family for a long time.	6	4	1
48	  And now we have two.  Two?	6	4	1
49	 The original weapon was absurdly large.	6	4	1
50	 Plenty of steel for two swords.	6	4	1
51	 Well, thank you. It's glorious.	6	4	1
52	 You'll have to train your left hand.	6	4	1
53	 Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands.	6	4	1
54	 You'll never be as good.	6	4	1
55	 No.	6	4	1

59	 Where's that written? I can and I will.	6	4	1
60	 The Kingsguard oath is for life.	6	4	1
61	 The war is over. The king is safe.	6	4	1
62	 The king is never safe.	7	4	1
63	 How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike?	7	4	1
64	 Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner.	7	4	1
65	 They will continue to do so when you go home.	7	4	1
66	  Home?  You'll return to Casterly Rock	7	4	1
67	 and rule in my stead.	7	4	1
68	 You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.	7	4	1
69	 I am the King's Hand. My place is here.	7	4	1
70	 I don't expect to see the Rock again before I die.	7	4	1
71	 You know what they call me?	7	4	1
72	 Kingslayer. Oathbreaker.	7	4	1
73	 Man without honor.	7	4	1
74	 Now you want me to break another sacred vow.	7	4	1
75	 You won't be breaking anything.	7	4	1
76	 There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties.	7	4	1
77	 The king will exercise that prerogative.	7	4	1
78	  No.  No?	7	4	1
79	 No.	7	4	1
80	 I don't believe I asked you a question.	7	4	1
81	 There's my answer.	7	4	1
82	 If you think your bloody honor comes before	7	4	1
83	 My bloody honor is beyond repair,	7	4	1
84	 but my answer is still no. I don't want Casterly Rock.	7	4	1
85	 I don't want a wife. I don't want children.	8	4	1
86	 What do you want?	8	4	1
87	 Supper would be nice.	8	4	1
88	 For 40 years I've tried to teach you.	8	4	1
89	 If you haven't learned by now, you never will.	8	4	1
90	 Go.	8	4	1
91	 If serving as a glorified bodyguard	8	4	1
92	 is the sum of your ambition, go serve.	8	4	1
93	 I suppose you want the sword back.	8	4	1
94	 Keep it.	8	4	1
95	 A one-handed man with no family needs	8	4	1
96	 all the help he can get.	8	4	1
97	 ( goats bleat )	8	4	1
98	 How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?	8	4	1
99	 Please don't.	9	4	1
100	  Seems to me the smart place	9	4	1
101	 to meet travelers is in a tavern.	9	4	1
102	 That way, one party is late,	9	4	1
103	 the other party can drink some ale inside.	9	4	1
104	 This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for,	9	4	1
105	 not one of your sellsword friends.	9	4	1
106	 If he's so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?	9	4	1
107	 There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne	9	4	1
108	 and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Has been for years.	9	4	1
109	 And just in case the Martells of Dorne	9	4	1
110	 are looking to spill some Lannister blood,	9	4	1
111	  it may as well be yours, eh?  No need for cynicism.	9	4	1
112	 I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.	9	4	1
113	 Oh.	9	4	1
114	 Ah, here we are.	9	4	1
115	 ( claps )	9	4	1
116	 Can you read the sigils?	9	4	1
117	 Yellow balls?	9	4	1
118	 Wild lemons on a purple field,	9	4	1
119	 House Dalt of Lemonwood.	9	4	1
120	 A vulture grasping a baby in its talons, House Blackmont.	9	4	1
121	 A crowned skull, the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave.	9	4	1
122	 Boy knows his Dornish Houses.	10	4	1
123	 I need a sigil.	10	4	1
124	 And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?	10	4	1
125	 I don't see it, my lord.	10	4	1
126	 Well met, my lords.	10	4	1
127	 His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name.	10	4	1
128	 My lord father, the King's Hand, sends his greetings as well.	10	4	1
129	 I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock,	10	4	1
130	 Master of Coin.	10	4	1
131	 Forgive me.	10	4	1
132	 I don't see Prince Doran in your company.	10	4	1
133	 The prince's health forces him to remain at Sunspear.	10	4	1
134	 He sends his brother Prince Oberyn	10	4	1
135	 to attend the royal wedding in his stead.	10	4	1
136	 Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company	10	4	1
137	 of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn	10	4	1
138	 at his wedding feast.	10	4	1
139	 Will he?	10	4	1
140	 And where is Prince Oberyn?	10	4	1
141	 Arrived before dawn.	10	4	1
142	 Not a man for welcome parties,	10	4	1
143	 our prince.	10	4	1
144	 Very well. My lords, these fine men from the City Watch	11	4	1
145	 will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep.	11	4	1
146	 You must be weary after such a long journey.	11	4	1
147	 Some accomplished diplomacy that was.	11	4	1
148	 Now where?	11	4	1
149	 We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody	11	4	1
150	 or several somebodies.	11	4	1
151	 How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?	11	4	1
152	 You're famous for fucking half of Westeros.	11	4	1
153	 You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads,	11	4	1
154	 where would you go?	11	4	1
155	 I'd probably go to sleep, but I'm getting old.	11	4	1
156	 Look at this one.	12	4	1
157	 How lovely is she?	12	4	1
158	 Beautiful.	12	4	1
159	 But pale.	12	4	1
160	 They like them pale in the capital.	12	4	1
161	 Shows they don't work the fields.	12	4	1
162	 Do I frighten you?	12	4	1
163	 You like?	12	4	1
164	 Timid. Timid bores me.	12	4	1
165	 You're a bit of mischief, aren't you?	12	4	1
166	 I think she likes you.	12	4	1
167	 She has good taste.	12	4	1
168	 You're not timid, are you?	12	4	1
169	 ( laughs ) Not timid.	12	4	1
170	 Do you like women?	12	4	1
171	 When they look like her, my lord.	12	4	1
172	 This one will do nicely.	12	4	1
173	  Very good, my lady.	12	4	1
174	 Oh, I'm not a lady.	13	4	1
175	 A term of courtesy in this establishment.	13	4	1
176	 A lie anywhere.	13	4	1
177	 Why not use the right words?	13	4	1
178	 I'm a bastard.	13	4	1
179	 She is a whore. And you're what?	13	4	1
180	 A procurer.	13	4	1
181	 Any of the others?	13	4	1
182	 The two girls can leave.	13	4	1
183	  ( snaps fingers )  You stay.	13	4	1
184	 I'm afraid I'm not an offer, my lord.	13	4	1
185	 Everyone who works for Littlefinger is an offer.	13	4	1
186	 Take off your clothes. We'll be here a while.	13	4	1
187	  My lord.  I am a prince, boy.	13	4	1
188	 Have you ever been with a prince?	13	4	1
189	 Can't say I have.	13	4	1
190	 I'm wildly expensive.	13	4	1
191	 Take off your clothes.	13	4	1
192	 Which way do you like it?	14	4	1
193	  ( gasps )  My way.	14	4	1
194	     And so he spoke and so he spoke   	14	4	1
195	    That Lord of Castamere   	14	4	1
196	     And now the rains...     Oberyn.	14	4	1
197	     Weep o'er his hall...     Oberyn, don't.	14	4	1
198	    With no one there to hear   	14	4	1
199	    Yes, not the rains weep o'er his hall   	14	4	1
200	    And not a soul to hear.   	14	4	1
201	 You lost, friend?	14	4	1
202	 Forgive me for staring.	14	4	1
203	 I don't see many Lannisters where I'm from.	14	4	1
204	 I don't see many Dornishmen in the capital.	14	4	1
205	 We don't like the smell. ( laughs )	14	4	1
206	  Come with me, lover.  Gods, look at this one.	14	4	1
207	 Sirs, if you follow me, I'll arrange for a private room.	15	4	1
208	 Why are you wasting a woman like this on a Dornishman?	15	4	1
209	 Bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil.	15	4	1
210	 ( laughs )	15	4	1
211	 Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister?	15	4	1
212	 You think your gold and your lions	15	4	1
213	 and your gold lions make you better than everyone.	15	4	1
214	 May I tell you a secret?	15	4	1
215	 You're not a golden lion.	15	4	1
216	 You're just a pink little man	15	4	1
217	 who is far too slow on the draw.	15	4	1
218	 ( screams )	15	4	1
219	 Longsword is a bad option in close quarters.	15	4	1
220	 When I pull my blade, your friend starts bleeding.	15	4	1
221	 Quite a lot, I'm afraid. So many veins in the wrist.	15	4	1
222	 ( groans )	15	4	1
223	 He'll live if you get him help straightaway.	16	4	1
224	 So, decisions.	16	4	1
225	 Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion.	16	4	1
226	  We heard there might be...  ( screams )	16	4	1
227	 ...trouble.	16	4	1
228	 Apologies, my love.	16	4	1
229	 I'm here to welcome you to the capital.	16	4	1
230	 Ellaria Sand, my paramour.	16	4	1
231	 The king's own Uncle Imp.	16	4	1
232	 Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister.	16	4	1
233	 If there's anything I can do to make your stay	16	4	1
234	 What are you? His hired killer?	16	4	1
235	 It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight.	16	4	1
236	 How did that come to pass?	16	4	1
237	 Killed the right people, I suppose.	16	4	1
238	 ( laughs )	16	4	1
239	 We'll need a few more girls. Girls, yes?	16	4	1
240	 You don't partake?	17	4	1
241	 Oh, I partook. Now I'm married.	17	4	1
242	 Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private?	17	4	1
243	 Seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake.	17	4	1
244	  Oh, they take all kinds.  Even Dornishmen.	17	4	1
245	 The king is very grateful that you traveled all	17	4	1
246	 this way for his wedding.	17	4	1
247	 Let us speak truth here. Joffrey is insulted.	17	4	1
248	 I am only the second son after all.	17	4	1
249	 Well, speaking as a fellow second son,	17	4	1
250	 I have grown rather used to being the family insult.	17	4	1
251	 ( chuckles )	17	4	1
252	 Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?	17	4	1
253	 I was invited to the royal wedding.	17	4	1
254	 I thought we were speaking truth.	17	4	1
255	 The last time I was in the capital was many years ago.	17	4	1
256	 Another wedding.	17	4	1
257	 My sister Elia	17	4	1
258	 and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon.	17	4	1
259	 My sister loved him. She bore his children.	17	4	1
260	 Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast.	17	4	1
261	 Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them.	18	4	1
262	 And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen	18	4	1
263	 left her for another woman.	18	4	1
264	 That started a war	18	4	1
265	 and the war ended right here	18	4	1
266	 when your father's army took the city...	18	4	1
267	 I wasn't actually present.	18	4	1
268	 ...and butchered those children.	18	4	1
269	 My nephew and niece.	18	4	1
270	 Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks.	18	4	1
271	 And my sister, you know what they did to her?	18	4	1
272	 I'm asking you a question.	18	4	1
273	 I've heard rumors.	18	4	1
274	 ( chuckles ) So have I.	18	4	1
275	 The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain	18	4	1
276	 raped Elia and split her in half	18	4	1
277	 with his great sword.	18	4	1
278	 I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.	18	4	1
279	 If the Mountain killed my sister,	18	4	1
280	 your father gave the order.	18	4	1
281	 Tell your father I'm here.	19	4	1
282	 And tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts.	19	4	1
283	 ( dragons screeching )	19	4	1
284	 ( growls )	19	4	1
285	 ( screeching )	19	4	1
286	  ( growls )  ( chuckles )	19	4	1
287	  ( screeches )  Shh.	19	4	1
288	 ( screeching )	19	4	1
289	 ( gasps )	20	4	1
290	 Shh. Shh.	20	4	1
291	  ( roars )  ( gasps )	20	4	1
292	 ( roars )	20	4	1
293	 They're dragons, Khaleesi.	20	4	1
294	 They can never be tamed.	20	4	1
295	 Not even by their mother.	20	4	1
296	  Ser Barristan.  Your Grace.	21	4	1
297	 Where's Daario Naharis?	21	4	1
298	 Where's Grey Worm?	21	4	1
299	 Gambling, Your Grace.	21	4	1
300	 Gambling?	21	4	1
301	  Mhysa. Mhysa. Mhysa...	21	4	1
302	 How long have they been at it?	21	4	1
303	 Since midnight, Your Grace.	21	4	1
304	 Ser Worm is stronger than he looks.	21	4	1
305	 But I can see his arms beginning to shake.	21	4	1
306	 What's the prize to winning this stupid contest?	22	4	1
307	 The honor of riding by your side on the road to Meereen.	22	4	1
308	 That honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan	22	4	1
309	 as neither of them kept me waiting this morning.	22	4	1
310	 You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock.	22	4	1
311	 The last man holding his sword	22	4	1
312	 can find a new queen to fight for.	22	4	1
313	 ( Daario groans )	22	4	1
314	 _	22	4	1
315	 _	22	4	1
316	 _	22	4	1
317	 _	22	4	1
318	 _	22	4	1
319	 You need to eat something.	22	4	1
320	 Pigeon pie.	22	4	1
321	 No, thank you.	22	4	1
322	 Lemon cakes?	23	4	1
323	 No, thank you.	23	4	1
324	 You love lemon cakes.	23	4	1
325	 Tell her she needs to eat.	23	4	1
326	 My lady, you do need to eat.	23	4	1
327	 I don't need to eat.	23	4	1
328	 If I could have a moment alone with my wife.	23	4	1
329	 She needs to eat.	23	4	1
330	 I can't let you starve.	23	4	1
331	 I swore to protect you.	23	4	1
332	 My lady,	23	4	1
333	 I am your husband. Let me help you.	23	4	1
334	 How can you help me?	23	4	1
335	 I don't know, but I can try.	24	4	1
336	 I lie awake all night staring at the canopy	24	4	1
337	 thinking about how they died.	24	4	1
338	 I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep.	24	4	1
339	 Do you know what they did to my brother?	24	4	1
340	 How they sewed his direwolf's head onto his body?	24	4	1
341	 And my mother.	24	4	1
342	 They say they cut her throat to the bone	24	4	1
343	 and threw her body in the river.	24	4	1
344	 What happened to your family was a terrible crime.	24	4	1
345	 I didn't know your brother.	24	4	1
346	 He seemed like a good man, but I didn't know him.	24	4	1
347	 Your mother, on the other hand,	24	4	1
348	 I admired her.	24	4	1
349	 She wanted to have me executed,	24	4	1
350	 but I admired her.	24	4	1
351	 She was a strong woman.	24	4	1
352	 And she was fierce	24	4	1
353	 when it came to protecting her children.	24	4	1
354	 Sansa.	25	4	1
355	 Your mother would want you to carry on.	25	4	1
356	 You know it's true.	25	4	1
357	 Will you pardon me, my lord?	25	4	1
358	 I'd like to visit the godswood.	25	4	1
359	 Of course. Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear.	25	4	1
360	 I don't pray anymore.	25	4	1
361	 It's the only place I can go where people don't talk to me.	25	4	1
362	 My lion.	25	4	1
363	 What are you doing?	25	4	1
364	 What does it look like I'm doing? Come here.	25	4	1
365	 How many times have I told you? You can't visit me here.	25	4	1
366	 I know. I know.	25	4	1
367	 We have come to a dangerous place.	26	4	1
368	 Have you forgotten me? Do you know how long it's been?	26	4	1
369	 Of course I haven't forgotten.	26	4	1
370	 I want you.	26	4	1
371	 Don't you want me?	26	4	1
372	 Things are a bit tense right now.	26	4	1
373	 What things?	26	4	1
374	 My nephew the king wants to murder me.	26	4	1
375	 My wife hates me because my father murdered her family.	26	4	1
376	 Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose	26	4	1
377	 last name is Lannister.	26	4	1
378	 You need to relax.	26	4	1
379	 Don't you want to relax?	26	4	1
380	  What's wrong?  I told you.	26	4	1
381	  It's not a good time.  It's never a good time.	26	4	1
382	  You have your child bride now.  Shae.	26	4	1
383	  Do you love her?  Love her?	26	4	1
384	 I barely know her. She's a child.	26	4	1
385	  She despises me.  That's not an answer.	26	4	1
386	 Of course I don't love her.	27	4	1
387	 You tried to ship me away.	27	4	1
388	 Ship you away?	27	4	1
389	 Give me diamonds and make me disappear.	27	4	1
390	 What in the world are you talking about?	27	4	1
391	 If you want me to leave, just say it.	27	4	1
392	  Say it!  Shh.	27	4	1
393	 I don't know what you're talking about.	27	4	1
394	 You want me to stay?	27	4	1
395	 ( groans )	27	4	1
396	 A work of art, really.	27	4	1
397	 The craftsmanship is excellent.	27	4	1
398	 You like it so much,	27	4	1
399	 you're welcome to chop off your own hand and take it.	27	4	1
400	 Such an ingrate. I spent days with the goldsmith	28	4	1
401	  getting the details just right.  Days?	28	4	1
402	 Better part of an afternoon.	28	4	1
403	 There, how does that feel?	28	4	1
404	 Uh...	28	4	1
405	 a hook would be more practical.	28	4	1
406	 Elegant, I think.	28	4	1
407	 Thank you for your help with the other matter.	28	4	1
408	  The symptoms have abated?  Gone completely.	28	4	1
409	 I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn.	28	4	1
410	 Not a maester, Your Grace, but happy to help	28	4	1
411	 whenever I can.	28	4	1
412	 Odd little man.	28	4	1
413	  I've grown rather fond of him.  ( door closes )	28	4	1
414	 He's quite talented, you know?	28	4	1
415	 What symptoms?	28	4	1
416	 Symptoms that are not your concern.	28	4	1
417	 You let him touch you?	28	4	1
418	 You jealous?	28	4	1
419	 I'm surprised.	28	4	1
420	 You never let Pycelle near you.	28	4	1
421	 ( laughs ) You think I'd let that old lecher	29	4	1
422	 put his hands on me?	29	4	1
423	 He smells like a dead cat.	29	4	1
424	 I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.	29	4	1
425	 Well, they smell like Pycelle.	29	4	1
426	 You drink more than you used to.	29	4	1
427	  Yes.  Why?	29	4	1
428	 Let's see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark	29	4	1
429	 and disappeared from the capital.	29	4	1
430	 My husband died in a tragic hunting accident.	29	4	1
431	 It must have been traumatic for you.	29	4	1
432	 My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne.	29	4	1
433	 We suffered through a siege.	29	4	1
434	 A rather short siege.	29	4	1
435	 A rather short siege that I didn't expect to survive.	29	4	1
436	 And now I'm marrying my eldest son	29	4	1
437	 to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden	29	4	1
438	 while I'm supposed to marry her brother,	29	4	1
439	 a renowned pillow biter. So...	29	4	1
440	 Father disowned me today.	29	4	1
441	 He can't disown you. You're all he's got.	29	4	1
442	 You're forgetting Tyrion.	29	4	1
443	 You don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you?	29	4	1
444	 Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here	30	4	1
445	 in the Red Keep with you.	30	4	1
446	  Not now.  I want	30	4	1
447	 Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.	30	4	1
448	  Something's changed.  Everything's changed.	30	4	1
449	 You come back after all this time with no apologies	30	4	1
450	 and one hand and expect everything to be the same?	30	4	1
451	 What do you want me to apologize for?	30	4	1
452	 For leaving me.	30	4	1
453	 You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?	30	4	1
454	 Don't know what you wanted. You weren't here.	30	4	1
455	 You left me alone.	30	4	1
456	 Every day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape.	30	4	1
457	 Every day. I murdered people so I could be here with you.	30	4	1
458	  You took too long.  I...	30	4	1
459	  What are you saying?  I'm saying you took too long.	30	4	1
460	 ( knocking )	30	4	1
461	  Come in.   Go away.	30	4	1
462	 Forgive me, Your Grace.	30	4	1
463	 You told me to come at once if there was anything important.	30	4	1
464	 You plan on killing all the crows yourself?	31	4	1
465	 Do you plan on sitting here scratching your balls till winter?	31	4	1
466	 We wait for Mance's orders.	31	4	1
467	 You sent a man over the Wall at the full moon.	31	4	1
468	 If he's not back yet, he's not coming back.	31	4	1
469	 And what is it you want?	31	4	1
470	 March on Castle Black with just this lot?	31	4	1
471	 Your pretty crow said 1,000 men are nesting there.	31	4	1
472	 Yeah, well, he's a liar.	31	4	1
473	 He is?	31	4	1
474	 Shouldn't it be he was?	31	4	1
475	 You said you put three arrows in him.	31	4	1
476	 I did.	31	4	1
477	 I've seen you slip a shaft through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards.	31	4	1
478	 If that boy's still walking, it's 'cause you let him go.	31	4	1
479	 ( whistles )	31	4	1
480	 Thenns.	32	4	1
481	 I fucking hate Thenns.	32	4	1
482	 Mance sent you?	32	4	1
483	  ( grunts )  How did you find us?	32	4	1
484	 You came from the south, not the north.	32	4	1
485	 Took a detour.	32	4	1
486	 Got some supper from a village down that way.	32	4	1
487	 Why does the meat down here taste so much better	32	4	1
488	 than it does on our side of the Wall?	33	4	1
489	 Help yourself.	33	4	1
490	 ( chuckles )	33	4	1
491	 Maybe everything's just better fed down here.	33	4	1
492	 Fat and lazy.	33	4	1
493	 Easier for us, hmm?	33	4	1
494	 You didn't see us coming?	33	4	1
495	 Lost your warg?	33	4	1
496	 And that baby crow you had with you,	33	4	1
497	 lost him too?	33	4	1
498	 I'll answer to Mance.	33	4	1
499	 I won't answer to you.	33	4	1
500	 She yours?	33	4	1
501	 I'm not anybody's.	33	4	1
502	 Too scrawny.	33	4	1
503	 Not like those crows at Castle Black.	33	4	1
504	 Think of them stuck in their larders	33	4	1
505	 stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage	34	4	1
506	 and stew, getting nice and fat	34	4	1
507	 and marbled.	34	4	1
508	 I know we've had our differences, Tormund,	34	4	1
509	 but just one time before you die,	34	4	1
510	 you really ought to try crow.	34	4	1
511	  Draw.	34	4	1
512	 Loose.	34	4	1
513	  Last time I saw him,	34	4	1
514	 he was in the courtyard at Winterfell.	34	4	1
515	 He said: Next time I see you,	34	4	1
516	 you'll be all in black.	34	4	1
517	 I was jealous of Robb my whole life.	34	4	1
518	 ( winces )	34	4	1
519	 The way my father looked at him,	34	4	1
520	 I wanted that.	34	4	1
521	 He was better than me at everything	34	4	1
522	 fighting and hunting	35	4	1
523	 and riding	35	4	1
524	 and girls.	35	4	1
525	 Gods, the girls loved him.	35	4	1
526	 I wanted to hate him, but I never could.	35	4	1
527	 Sometimes I want to hate you.	35	4	1
528	 Well, you're better than me at everything.	35	4	1
529	 Except reading.	35	4	1
530	 They're they're ready for you.	35	4	1
531	 He's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance.	35	4	1
532	 No one's going to hang you.	35	4	1
533	 You've done nothing wrong.	35	4	1
534	 I've done plenty wrong.	35	4	1
535	 So you admit you murdered Qhorin Halfhand?	35	4	1
536	  I didn't murder him.	35	4	1
537	 No? You put your sword	36	4	1
538	 through a brother of the Night's Watch.	36	4	1
539	 What do you call that?	36	4	1
540	 He wanted me to kill him.	36	4	1
541	 A bastard son of a traitor.	36	4	1
542	 What would you expect?	36	4	1
543	 The Halfhand believed our only chance	36	4	1
544	 to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.	36	4	1
545	 Don't talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him.	36	4	1
546	 He was my brother.	36	4	1
547	 Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall.	36	4	1
548	 The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him...	36	4	1
549	  The free folk? Listen to him.	36	4	1
550	 He even talks like a wildling now.	36	4	1
551	 Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings.	36	4	1
552	 I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I	36	4	1
553	 I laid with a wildling girl.	36	4	1
554	 You admit to breaking your vows, then?	36	4	1
555	 I do.	36	4	1
556	 The law is the law. The boy must die.	36	4	1
557	 If we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl,	36	4	1
558	 the Wall would be manned by headless men.	36	4	1
559	 There's a difference between sneaking off	36	4	1
560	 to the Mole's Town brothel and sleeping with the enemy.	37	4	1
561	 While we sit here	37	4	1
562	 debating which rules I broke,	37	4	1
563	 Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000.	37	4	1
564	 Impossible.	37	4	1
565	 You can't get 50 wildlings together	37	4	1
566	 before they start killing each other.	37	4	1
567	 100,000. He's united the Thenns,	37	4	1
568	 the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans.	37	4	1
569	 He has giants fighting for him.	37	4	1
570	 ( laughs ) Giants?	37	4	1
571	 Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?	37	4	1
572	 I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing, boy.	37	4	1
573	 And now you're here.	37	4	1
574	 You must not have been very good at your job.	37	4	1
575	 How dare you?!	37	4	1
576	 There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already	37	4	1
577	 led by Tormund Giantsbane.	37	4	1
578	 I killed their warg and three others.	37	4	1
579	 They shot me full of arrows.	37	4	1
580	 Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south	37	4	1
581	 when Mance hits it from the north.	37	4	1
582	 The signal for the attack will be a bonfire.	37	4	1
583	 Mance said it would be the greatest fire	37	4	1
584	 the North has ever seen.	37	4	1
585	 That's the truth.	37	4	1
586	 All the truth.	38	4	1
587	 Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?	38	4	1
588	 None of us are free.	38	4	1
589	 We are men of the Night's Watch.	38	4	1
590	 But we won't be taking your head today, Jon Snow.	38	4	1
591	 Go on.	38	4	1
592	 I am acting commander here, Maester Aemon.	38	4	1
593	 Yes, you are.	38	4	1
594	 And I don't trust the bastard.	38	4	1
595	 He told the truth.	38	4	1
596	 And you always know when a man's telling a lie?	38	4	1
597	 How did you acquire this magical power?	38	4	1
598	 I grew up in King's Landing.	38	4	1
599	  No. No.	38	4	1
600	 You're a queen, not an ox.	38	4	1
601	 Your grandfather gave me a necklace	39	4	1
602	 just like this one for my 51st nameday.	39	4	1
603	 The wedding is in a fortnight, Grandmother.	39	4	1
604	 You can't say no to everything.	39	4	1
605	 Nonsense. My little dears.	39	4	1
606	 Go and speak to the jewelers of King's Landing.	39	4	1
607	 Tell them who you are, tell them who sent you.	39	4	1
608	 The one who brings me the best necklace	39	4	1
609	 will get to keep the next best.	39	4	1
610	 ( girls laughing )	39	4	1
611	 The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the sept	39	4	1
612	 a fortnight from now will inspire 1,000 songs.	39	4	1
613	 Now, how sad it will be if she's wearing rubbish like that.	39	4	1
614	 Perhaps I should just let Joffrey choose it for me.	39	4	1
615	 End up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck.	39	4	1
616	 You watch that. Even here, even with me.	39	4	1
617	 ( footsteps approaching )	39	4	1
618	 My word.	39	4	1
619	 My lady. My lady.	39	4	1
620	 Please pardon me for interrupting.	39	4	1
621	 My name is Brienne of Tarth.	39	4	1
622	 We know who you are. We've heard all about you.	40	4	1
623	 But hearing is one thing.	40	4	1
624	 Aren't you just marvelous?	40	4	1
625	 Absolutely singular.	40	4	1
626	 I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt	40	4	1
627	 like the silly little boy he is.	40	4	1
628	 My lady, I know this is a very busy time for you,	40	4	1
629	 but if I could just have a moment.	40	4	1
630	 You dare not refuse.	40	4	1
631	 A shadow?	40	4	1
632	 A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon.	40	4	1
633	 I swear to you by all the gods it was Stannis.	40	4	1
634	 He plunged his sword through Renly's heart	40	4	1
635	 and disappeared.	40	4	1
636	 One day, my lady, I will avenge our king.	40	4	1
637	 Joffrey is our king now.	40	4	1
638	 I meant no offense.	40	4	1
639	 And you've given none.	40	4	1
640	 All the Kingsguard will be on duty, of course.	41	4	1
641	 Ser Boros will be stationed here.	41	4	1
642	 Ser Preston will be stationed here	41	4	1
643	 beside the primary entertainment.	41	4	1
644	 Your Grace?	41	4	1
645	 Yes, yes, one guard at the	41	4	1
646	 the thing. Go on.	41	4	1
647	 Ser Meryn will guard Lady Margaery and Tommen.	41	4	1
648	 I've always guarded the king himself, my lord.	41	4	1
649	 Ever since your absence.	41	4	1
650	 And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn.	41	4	1
651	 All very good. I don't expect any trouble.	41	4	1
652	 The people love their king.	41	4	1
653	 They know who keeps them fed.	41	4	1
654	 Margaery Tyrell, I've heard.	41	4	1
655	 By my leave.	41	4	1
656	 They know I saved the city. They know I won the war.	41	4	1
657	 The war's not won. Not while Stannis lives.	41	4	1
658	 I broke Stannis on the Blackwater.	41	4	1
659	 Pity you weren't there to help, Uncle.	41	4	1
660	 My apologies, Your Grace. I was rather busy.	41	4	1
661	 Busy getting captured.	41	4	1
662	 So this is the famous Book of Brothers?	41	4	1
663	 All the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard.	42	4	1
664	 Ser Arthur Dayne. The Sword of the Morning.	42	4	1
665	 ( chuckles )	42	4	1
666	 Led the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood.	42	4	1
667	 Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat.	42	4	1
668	 Ser Duncan the Tall.	42	4	1
669	 ( laughs )	42	4	1
670	 Four pages for Ser Duncan.	42	4	1
671	 He must have been quite a man.	42	4	1
672	 So they say.	42	4	1
673	 Ser Jaime Lannister.	42	4	1
674	 ( chuckles )	42	4	1
675	 Someone forgot to write down all your great deeds.	42	4	1
676	  There's still time.  Is there?	42	4	1
677	 For a 40yearold knight with one hand?	42	4	1
678	 How can you protect me with that?	42	4	1
679	 I use my left hand now, Your Grace.	42	4	1
680	 Makes for more of a contest.	42	4	1
681	  Have you ever been to Meereen?	43	4	1
682	 Several times, Your Grace, with Master Kraznys.	43	4	1
683	 And?	43	4	1
684	 They say 1,000 slaves died	43	4	1
685	 building the Great Pyramid of Meereen.	43	4	1
686	 And now an army of former slaves	43	4	1
687	 is marching to her gates.	43	4	1
688	 You think the Great Masters are worried?	43	4	1
689	 If they're smart, Your Grace.	43	4	1
690	 You were told to ride at the back of the train.	43	4	1
691	 Yes, my queen.	43	4	1
692	 But I need to speak to you about something important.	43	4	1
693	 A matter of strategy.	43	4	1
694	 Your Grace.	43	4	1
695	 All right, what is this matter of strategy?	43	4	1
696	 A dusk rose.	44	4	1
697	 Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding?	44	4	1
698	 And this one's called lady's lace.	44	4	1
699	 Would you like to walk without shoes?	44	4	1
700	 You have to know a land to rule it.	44	4	1
701	 Its plants, its rivers,	44	4	1
702	 its roads, its people.	44	4	1
703	 Dusk rose tea eases fever.	44	4	1
704	 Everyone in Meereen knows that.	44	4	1
705	 Especially the slaves who have to make the tea.	44	4	1
706	 If you want them to follow you,	44	4	1
707	 you have to become a part of their world.	44	4	1
708	 Strategy.	44	4	1
709	 Harpy's Gold.	44	4	1
710	 No tea from this one.	44	4	1
711	 Beautiful but poisonous.	44	4	1
712	 You are a gambler, aren't you?	44	4	1
713	 Your Grace.	44	4	1
714	 ( man shouts in Valyrian )	45	4	1
715	 There's one on every mile marker between here and Meereen.	45	4	1
716	 How many miles are there between here and Meereen?	45	4	1
717	 163, Your Grace.	45	4	1
718	  I'll tell our men to ride ahead and bury them.	45	4	1
719	 You don't need to see this.	45	4	1
720	 You will do no such thing.	45	4	1
721	 I will see each and every one of their faces.	45	4	1
722	 Remove her collar before you bury her.	45	4	1
723	  There she is.	46	4	1
724	  Yes, there she is.	46	4	1
725	  And?  You made a promise.	46	4	1
726	 To return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead.	46	4	1
727	 To keep them safe.	46	4	1
728	 Well, Arya Stark hasn't been seen	46	4	1
729	 since her father was killed.	46	4	1
730	 Where do you think she is? My money's on dead.	46	4	1
731	 There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say?	46	4	1
732	 And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister.	46	4	1
733	 Bit of a complication.	46	4	1
734	 A complication does not release you from a vow.	46	4	1
735	 What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sister-in-law?	46	4	1
736	 And take her where? Where would she be safer than here?	46	4	1
737	 Look me in the eye and tell me	46	4	1
738	 that you think she'll be safe in King's Landing.	46	4	1
739	 Are you sure we're not related?	46	4	1
740	 Ever since I've returned, every Lannister I've seen	46	4	1
741	 has been a miserable pain in my ass.	46	4	1
742	 Maybe you're a Lannister, too.	46	4	1
743	 You've got the hair for it if not the looks.	46	4	1
744	 ( footsteps )	47	4	1
745	 ( footsteps stop )	47	4	1
746	 ( gasps )	47	4	1
747	  ( gasps )  It's all right.	47	4	1
748	 It's all right. It's all right.	47	4	1
749	  You're drunk.  Yes.	47	4	1
750	 I have good reason to be.	47	4	1
751	 Once I was a knight. Now I'm only a fool.	48	4	1
752	 Don't you know me?	48	4	1
753	 Ser Dontos. The king's nameday celebration.	48	4	1
754	 I'm sorry. I should have remembered.	48	4	1
755	 I can't accept your apology.	48	4	1
756	 I may be a fool, but I'm a living fool, thanks to you.	48	4	1
757	 Anyone would have done the same.	48	4	1
758	 But only you did.	48	4	1
759	 I can never repay you.	48	4	1
760	 You gave me my life. But this,	48	4	1
761	 this is worth more than my life.	48	4	1
762	 It belonged to my mother and her mother before her.	48	4	1
763	 House Hollard was strong once.	48	4	1
764	 House on the rise.	48	4	1
765	 That's all that's left of those days,	48	4	1
766	 thanks to a few sad, fat drunks like me.	48	4	1
767	 I can't take it.	48	4	1
768	 It's very, very kind of you, but I can't.	48	4	1
769	 I don't have anything else left.	48	4	1
770	 That's all.	49	4	1
771	 Take it. Wear it.	49	4	1
772	 Let my name have one more moment in the sun	49	4	1
773	 before it disappears from the world.	49	4	1
774	 I'll wear it with pride, Ser Dontos.	49	4	1
775	 Yeah.	49	4	1
776	 ( flies buzzing )	49	4	1
777	  When am I going to get a horse of my own?	49	4	1
778	 The little lady wants a pony.	49	4	1
779	 The little lady wants away from your stench.	49	4	1
780	 Horses aren't easy to come by.	49	4	1
781	 Even if they were,	49	4	1
782	 you think I'm gonna put you on your own horse?	49	4	1
783	 Watch the only thing of value I've got in the world ride away?	50	4	1
784	 Why don't you have any money?	50	4	1
785	 Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey before you left?	50	4	1
786	 No.	50	4	1
787	 You're not very smart, are you?	50	4	1
788	 I'm not a thief.	50	4	1
789	 You're fine with murdering little boys,	50	4	1
790	 but thieving is beneath you?	50	4	1
791	 A man's got to have a code.	50	4	1
792	 You think I'm gonna escape?	50	4	1
793	 Where would I go?	50	4	1
794	 I'd be dead by nightfall without you.	50	4	1
795	 My family's gone. I've got no one.	50	4	1
796	 You've got an aunt in the Vale.	50	4	1
797	 Your rich Aunt Lysa. After I sell you to her,	50	4	1
798	 maybe she'll have enough left over	50	4	1
799	 to buy you that pony you want so much.	50	4	1
800	  I'm hungry. You're hungry.	50	4	1
801	 Five horses, five men.	50	4	1
802	 More than I feel like killing on an empty stomach.	50	4	1
803	 I know him.	51	4	1
804	 The small one. His name is Polliver.	51	4	1
805	 He captured us and took us to Harrenhal.	51	4	1
806	 ( urinating )	51	4	1
807	 He killed Lommy.	51	4	1
808	 What the fuck's a Lommy?	51	4	1
809	 He was my friend.	51	4	1
810	 Polliver stole my sword and put it right through his neck.	51	4	1
811	 He's still got it.	51	4	1
812	  Got what?	51	4	1
813	 My sword Needle.	51	4	1
814	 Needle? Of course you named your sword.	51	4	1
815	 Lots of people name their swords.	51	4	1
816	 Lots of cunts.	51	4	1
817	 What are you get back here.	51	4	1
818	 My brother gave me that sword.	51	4	1
819	  Get back here.  He killed my friend.	51	4	1
820	 I don't care if he ate your friend.	51	4	1
821	 We're not going in there.	51	4	1
822	  ( man laughing )   Come on, give it up.	51	4	1
823	 ( woman whimpering )	51	4	1
824	  Come here.  ( whimpering )	52	4	1
825	  Let's have a feel there.  Leave it.	52	4	1
826	  ( laughing )  Come here.	52	4	1
827	 Please, she's a good girl.	52	4	1
828	 Shut your mouth and pour us more ale	52	4	1
829	 and we may not take her with us when we're done with her.	52	4	1
830	 I know you.	52	4	1
831	 You're the Hound.	52	4	1
832	 Pour our new friend some ale.	53	4	1
833	 What brings you so far north?	53	4	1
834	 I could ask the same of you.	53	4	1
835	 What are you doing up here?	53	4	1
836	 Just keeping the king's peace.	53	4	1
837	 No need. The war's over.	53	4	1
838	 So I've heard. Stannis defeated at the Blackwater.	53	4	1
839	 Robb Stark killed at the Twins.	53	4	1
840	 And where am I for all of it?	53	4	1
841	 Stuck with your brother.	53	4	1
842	  Meaning no offense.  None taken.	53	4	1
843	 He's good, the Mountain is.	53	4	1
844	 Best at what he does.	53	4	1
845	 But torture, torture, torture, torture.	53	4	1
846	 You spend enough time putting the hammer to people,	53	4	1
847	 you start to feel like a carpenter making chairs.	53	4	1
848	 Drains the fun right out of it.	53	4	1
849	 And what's life without a little fun?	53	4	1
850	 ( chuckles )	53	4	1
851	 But I don't need to tell you that, eh?	53	4	1
852	 She's all right. I've had better.	53	4	1
853	 ( laughs )	53	4	1
854	 You know what?	53	4	1
855	 You should come with us.	54	4	1
856	 His kind, they've always got something hidden away somewhere.	54	4	1
857	 Gold, silver, more daughters.	54	4	1
858	 Always something if you know how to make them talk.	54	4	1
859	 And there's plenty of him between here and King's Landing.	54	4	1
860	 You could do well for yourself.	54	4	1
861	 We certainly have been.	54	4	1
862	 I'm not going to King's Landing.	54	4	1
863	 Think about it. We could do whatever we like	54	4	1
864	 wherever we go.	54	4	1
865	 These are the king's colors.	54	4	1
866	 No one's standing in his way now.	54	4	1
867	 Which means no one's standing in ours.	54	4	1
868	 Fuck the king.	54	4	1
869	 ( chatter stops )	54	4	1
870	 When I heard that Joffrey's dog had tucked tail	54	4	1
871	 and run from the Battle of the Blackwater,	54	4	1
872	 I didn't believe it.	54	4	1
873	  But here you are.  Here I am.	54	4	1
874	 Bring me one of those chickens.	55	4	1
875	  You got money to pay for it?  You paid for it?	55	4	1
876	 ( laughs ) No.	55	4	1
877	 But we're the king's men.	55	4	1
878	 So, you got money?	55	4	1
879	 Not a penny.	55	4	1
880	 I'll still take that chicken.	55	4	1
881	 Tell you what.	55	4	1
882	 We'll trade you.	55	4	1
883	 One of our little chickens for one of yours.	55	4	1
884	 Give us a go at your friend.	55	4	1
885	 Lowell there likes them a bit broken in.	55	4	1
886	 ( men chuckle )	55	4	1
887	 You're a talker.	55	4	1
888	 Listening to talkers makes me thirsty.	55	4	1
889	 Ah.	56	4	1
890	 And hungry.	56	4	1
891	 Think I'll take two chickens.	56	4	1
892	 You don't seem to understand the situation.	56	4	1
893	 I understand that if any more words	56	4	1
894	 come pouring out of your cunt mouth,	56	4	1
895	 I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room.	56	4	1
896	 You lived your life for the king.	56	4	1
897	 You're gonna die for some chickens?	56	4	1
898	 Someone is.	56	4	1
899	 ( shouts )	56	4	1
900	 ( whimpering )	57	4	1
901	 ( grunting )	57	4	1
902	 ( groans )	57	4	1
903	 ( screams )	57	4	1
904	 ( screaming )	58	4	1
905	 ( gasping )	58	4	1
906	 ( grunts )	58	4	1
907	 ( groans )	58	4	1
908	 ( screams )	58	4	1
909	 ( groans )	58	4	1
910	 Something wrong with your leg, boy?	58	4	1
911	 What? What do you mean?	58	4	1
912	 Can you walk? I've got to carry you?	58	4	1
913	 Carry me?	58	4	1
914	 Fine little blade.	58	4	1
915	 Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.	58	4	1
916	 ( gasps )	59	4	1

4	 ( bird screeches )	1	5	8
5	 Your Grace, I want to say--	2	5	8
6	 You will not speak.	2	5	8
7	 How do I know you are who you say you are?	2	5	8
8	 If only I were otherwise.	2	5	8
9	 If you are Tyrion Lannister, why shouldn't I kill you	2	5	8
10	 to pay your family back for what it did to mine?	2	5	8
11	 You want revenge against the Lannisters?	2	5	8
12	 I killed my mother Joanna Lannister	2	5	8
13	 on the day I was born.	2	5	8
14	 I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bolt to the heart.	2	5	8
15	 I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.	2	5	8
16	 So I should welcome you into my service	2	5	8
17	 because you murdered members of your own family?	2	5	8
18	 Into your service?	2	5	8
19	 Your Grace, we have only just met.	2	5	8
20	 It's too soon to know if you deserve my service.	2	5	8
21	 If you'd rather return to the fighting pits,	2	5	8
22	 just say the word.	2	5	8
23	 When I was a young man, I heard a story	2	5	8
24	 about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory.	2	5	8
25	 She had no wealth, no lands, no army,	3	5	8
26	 only a name and a handful of supporters,	3	5	8
27	 most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves.	3	5	8
28	 They kept her alive, moving her from place to place,	3	5	8
29	 often hours ahead of the men who'd been sent to kill her.	3	5	8
30	 She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world	3	5	8
31	 and that appeared to be that.	3	5	8
32	 And then a few years later,	3	5	8
33	 the most well-informed person I knew	3	5	8
34	 told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies	3	5	8
35	 had somehow acquired all three in a very short span of time,	3	5	8
36	 along with three dragons.	3	5	8
37	 He thought she was our best,	3	5	8
38	 last chance to build a better world.	3	5	8
39	 I thought you were worth meeting at the very least.	3	5	8
40	 And why are you worth meeting?	3	5	8
41	 Why should I spend my time listening to you?	3	5	8
42	 Because you cannot build a better world on your own.	3	5	8
43	 You have no one at your side who understands the land you want to rule.	3	5	8
44	 The strengths and weaknesses of the houses	3	5	8
45	 that will either join or oppose you.	3	5	8
46	 I will have a very large army	3	5	8
47	 and very large dragons.	3	5	8
48	 Killing and politics aren't always the same thing.	4	5	8
49	 When I served as Hand of the King,	4	5	8
50	 I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question	4	5	8
51	 preferred torturing animals to leading his people.	4	5	8
52	 I could do an even better job	4	5	8
53	 advising a ruler worth the name.	4	5	8
54	 If that is indeed what you are.	4	5	8
55	 So you want to advise me?	4	5	8
56	 Very well.	4	5	8
57	 What would you have me do with him?	4	5	8
58	 I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.	4	5	8
59	 I know.	4	5	8
60	 Why should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises?	4	5	8
61	 Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you,	4	5	8
62	 he is no longer that man.	4	5	8
63	 I can't remember ever seeing a sane man	4	5	8
64	 as devoted to anything as he is to serving you.	4	5	8
65	 He claims he would kill for you and die for you	4	5	8
66	 and nothing I ever witnessed gives me reason to doubt him.	4	5	8
67	 And yet he did betray you.	5	5	8
68	 Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayal?	5	5	8
69	 Yes.	5	5	8
70	 Many opportunities.	5	5	8
71	  And did he?	5	5	8
72	 No, not until forced to do so.	5	5	8
73	 He worships you.	5	5	8
74	 He is in love with you, I think.	5	5	8
75	 But he did not trust you with the truth.	5	5	8
76	 An unpleasant truth to be sure,	5	5	8
77	 but one of great significance to you.	5	5	8
78	 He did not trust that you would be wise >enough to forgive him.	5	5	8
79	 So I should kill him?	5	5	8
80	 A ruler who kills those devoted to her	5	5	8
81	 is not a ruler who inspires devotion.	6	5	8
82	 And you're going to need to inspire devotion,	6	5	8
83	 a lot of it, if you're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea.	6	5	8
84	 But you cannot have him by your side when you do.	6	5	8
85	 Remove Ser Jorah from the city.	6	5	8
86	 ( door slams )	7	5	8
87	 Confess.	7	5	8
88	 My son.	7	5	8
89	 Let me speak to--	7	5	8
90	 Confess.	7	5	8
91	 I meant it.	7	5	8
92	 My face will be the last thing you see--	7	5	8
93	 ( door opens )	7	5	8
94	 ( sobbing )	7	5	8
95	 ( screams )	8	5	8
96	 My name is Lanna. I'm an orphan.	8	5	8
97	 When I was eight, I begged enough money	8	5	8
98	 to buy my first bucket of oysters.	8	5	8
99	 I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy two more.	8	5	8
100	 ( people chattering )	8	5	8
101	  It took a while, but I finally saved enough	8	5	8
102	 to buy myself an oyster cart.	8	5	8
103	 Now every morning,	8	5	8
104	 I make my way down to the canals.	8	5	8
105	 I pass the fish mongers and the bakers.	8	5	8
106	 I usually see Lhara,	8	5	8
107	 my first customer of the day on her way home.	8	5	8
108	 Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--	8	5	8
109	 ( cracks )	8	5	8
110	 Turn left onto Ragman Lane	8	5	8
111	 where I do most of my trade.	8	5	8
112	 Lanna is very impressive.	8	5	8
113	 Very industrious.	8	5	8
114	 She will make a fine servant for the Many-Faced God.	9	5	8
115	 How will she serve him?	9	5	8
116	 She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane.	9	5	8
117	 She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.	9	5	8
118	 What will she do there?	9	5	8
119	 She will see.	9	5	8
120	 - ( people chattering ) -  See what?	9	5	8
121	  How can a man tell a girl this?	9	5	8
122	 If he knew what she would see,	9	5	8
123	 there would be no reason to send her.	9	5	8
124	 Oysters, clams, and cockles!	9	5	8
125	 ( laughs )	9	5	8
126	 Oysters, clams, and cockles!	9	5	8
127	 Oysters, clams, and cockles!	9	5	8
128	 Your oysters fresh?	9	5	8
129	 Best in the city.	10	5	8
130	 You wouldn't lie to an old man, would you?	10	5	8
131	 Mm.	10	5	8
132	 Very nice. Give me four with vinegar.	10	5	8
133	 It's my 18th voyage.	10	5	8
134	 Returned from all of them without a scratch on me.	10	5	8
135	 Can't do it.	10	5	8
136	  Please, I've three children.	10	5	8
137	 Without me...	10	5	8
138	 Here, take it. You have to.	10	5	8
139	 I've three children.	10	5	8
140	 - What will they do? - Come on.	10	5	8
141	 They've nothing without me.	10	5	8
142	 Please, you have to!	10	5	8
143	 Please, you don't understand!	10	5	8
144	 Please!	10	5	8
145	  The man is a gambler.	11	5	8
146	 He wages that a sailor's ship	11	5	8
147	 will make it to its destination.	11	5	8
148	 It is a strange wager for the captain.	11	5	8
149	 He only wins if he loses his life.	11	5	8
150	 So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?	11	5	8
151	 A girl tells a man that she has seen.	11	5	8
152	 If the captain dies,	11	5	8
153	 the thin man pays his family a lot of money.	11	5	8
154	 But perhaps the gambler loses his bet	11	5	8
155	 and decides he does not have to pay after all.	11	5	8
156	 A destitute woman and her small child,	11	5	8
157	 what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself?	11	5	8
158	 To whom can they turn for recourse?	11	5	8
159	 ( whispering prayer )	11	5	8
160	 The Many-Faced God.	11	5	8
161	 You said you didn't know what I would see at the docks.	12	5	8
162	 A man had no idea what a girl would see and what she would not.	12	5	8
163	 A girl named Lanna will return to the docks.	12	5	8
164	 She will watch the gambler.	12	5	8
165	 She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.	12	5	8
166	 And then what?	12	5	8
167	 A gift for the thin man.	12	5	8
168	 She's not ready.	12	5	8
169	 Perhaps she is, perhaps she's not.	12	5	8
170	 And if she's not?	12	5	8
171	 It is all the same to the Many-Faced God.	12	5	8
172	 ( door unlocks, opens )	13	5	8
173	 ( door locks )	13	5	8
174	 The trial will take place soon.	13	5	8
175	 The High Sparrow will be presenting	13	5	8
176	 a substantial case against you.	13	5	8
177	 The charges?	13	5	8
178	 Fornication, treason, incest,	13	5	8
179	 the murder of King Robert.	13	5	8
180	 All lies.	13	5	8
181	 Of course, Your Grace.	13	5	8
182	 My concern is that the Faith does not adhere	13	5	8
183	 to the same standards of proof as the crown.	13	5	8
184	 I hope you'll excuse me for saying it,	13	5	8
185	 but belief is so often the death of reason.	13	5	8
186	 I wish you had said it sooner.	13	5	8
187	 Is there any word from Jaime?	13	5	8
188	 No, I'm afraid not.	13	5	8
189	 Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle	14	5	8
190	 has summoned your Uncle Kevan	14	5	8
191	 back from Casterly Rock	14	5	8
192	 to serve as Hand of the King.	14	5	8
193	 He now presides over the small council.	14	5	8
194	 Tell him I need to speak to him.	14	5	8
195	 I implored him to visit you, but he would not.	14	5	8
196	 What about my son, the king?	14	5	8
197	 If you can visit me, then surely the king...	14	5	8
198	 Your arrest and Queen Margaery's arrest,	14	5	8
199	 the king has not taken them well.	14	5	8
200	 He remains in his chambers.	14	5	8
201	 His servants often find his food in the hall left untouched.	14	5	8
202	 You need to talk to him.	14	5	8
203	 You need to talk to my son and tell him to come and see me,	14	5	8
204	 come and see his mother.	14	5	8
205	 He-- I tried, Your Grace.	14	5	8
206	 He wouldn't see me. He won't see anyone.	14	5	8
207	 I can't stay here.	14	5	8
208	 There is a way, Your Grace.	14	5	8
209	 A way out.	15	5	8
210	 Confess?	15	5	8
211	 To the High Sparrow?	15	5	8
212	 I won't.	15	5	8
213	 I made him.	15	5	8
214	 I rose him up from nothing.	15	5	8
215	 I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner	15	5	8
216	 and beg his forgiveness.	15	5	8
217	 Good-bye, my queen.	15	5	8
218	 The work continues.	15	5	8
219	 Why?	16	5	8
220	 Why, Theon?	16	5	8
221	 I'm not Theon. There is no Theon.	16	5	8
222	 - Reek. - Reek.	16	5	8
223	 Why did you tell him, Reek?	16	5	8
224	 I was helping you.	16	5	8
225	 You wanted to escape.	16	5	8
226	 There is no escape.	16	5	8
227	 Not ever.	16	5	8
228	 Theon Greyjoy tried to escape.	16	5	8
229	 The master knew.	16	5	8
230	 He knows everything.	16	5	8
231	 He hunted him and caught him	16	5	8
232	 and strapped him to a cross	16	5	8
233	 and cut away piece after piece	16	5	8
234	 until there was no Theon left.	16	5	8
235	 Good.	16	5	8
236	 If it weren't for you, I'd still have a family.	17	5	8
237	 If I could do what Ramsay did to you	17	5	8
238	 right here, right now, I would.	17	5	8
239	 I deserved everything.	17	5	8
240	 I deserve to be Reek.	17	5	8
241	 ! I did terrible things.	17	5	8
242	 Turned on Robb.	17	5	8
243	 Captured Winterfell.	17	5	8
244	" - Killed those boys. - They weren't ""those boys."""	17	5	8
245	 They were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers.	17	5	8
246	 You've known them since they were born.	17	5	8
247	 They weren't. They were only--	17	5	8
248	 Only what?	17	5	8
249	 - I can't. - Tell me.	17	5	8
250	 I can't, not unless the master says.	17	5	8
251	 - Tell me. They weren't what? - They weren't--	17	5	8
252	 Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be gone	17	5	8
253	 while you still breathe the air.	17	5	8
254	 Tell me to my face, Theon.	17	5	8
255	 Tell me that they weren't your brothers!	17	5	8
256	 They weren't Bran and Rickon!	17	5	8
257	 I couldn't find them.	17	5	8
258	 It was two farm boys.	18	5	8
259	 I killed them and burned them so no one would know.	18	5	8
260	 You didn't?	18	5	8
261	 Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?	18	5	8
262	 I can't talk to you anymore.	18	5	8
263	 Theon, you have to tell me. Do you have any idea where--	18	5	8
264	 Not Theon! Reek!	18	5	8
265	 ( door closes )	18	5	8
266	 Our scouts tell us he's got no more than 6,000 men.	18	5	8
267	 More than half of those are mounted, however.	18	5	8
268	 And how high do Stannis's horses jump?	18	5	8
269	 Our walls have been fully repaired.	18	5	8
270	 The gates have been reinforced.	18	5	8
271	 We have enough food for six months.	18	5	8
272	 We are more prepared for a siege than they could ever be.	18	5	8
273	 All we have to do is wait for them to freeze,	18	5	8
274	 starve, and mutiny.	18	5	8
275	 You disagree?	19	5	8
276	 Stannis isn't from the North.	19	5	8
277	 You are, Father.	19	5	8
278	 I think you're missing an opportunity to show the people of the North	19	5	8
279	 how House Bolton treats southern invaders.	19	5	8
280	 And what do you recommend?	19	5	8
281	 That we not sit and wait for Stannis	19	5	8
282	 to decide what sort of fight this is going to be.	19	5	8
283	 That we hit first and hit hard	19	5	8
284	 and leave a feast for the crows.	19	5	8
285	 A smart commander does not abandon a defensive advantage.	19	5	8
286	 As long as we stay behind these walls,	19	5	8
287	 they can't touch us.	19	5	8
288	 Not to mention that the snow is so deep,	19	5	8
289	 we couldn't get an army through to engage them	19	5	8
290	 even if we wanted to.	19	5	8
291	 I don't need an army.	19	5	8
292	 I need 20 good men.	19	5	8
293	 So, have you decided yet?	19	5	8
294	 Whether I'm worthy of your service?	19	5	8
295	 Have you decided yet whether you're going to have me killed?	19	5	8
296	 It's probably my safest option.	20	5	8
297	 I can see why you would think so.	20	5	8
298	 It's what your father would have done.	20	5	8
299	 And what would your father have done?	20	5	8
300	 My father,	20	5	8
301	 who publically sentenced me to death?	20	5	8
302	 I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.	20	5	8
303	 Is that why you killed him?	20	5	8
304	 Someday if you decide not to execute me,	20	5	8
305	 I'll tell you all about why I killed my father.	20	5	8
306	 And on that day, should it ever come,	20	5	8
307	 we'll need more wine than this.	20	5	8
308	 I know what my father was.	20	5	8
309	 What he did.	20	5	8
310	 I know the Mad King earned his name.	20	5	8
311	 So, here we sit.	20	5	8
312	 Two terrible children of two terrible fathers.	20	5	8
313	 I'm terrible?	20	5	8
314	 I've heard stories.	20	5	8
315	 Why did you travel to the far side of the world to meet someone terrible?	21	5	8
316	 To see if you were the right kind of terrible.	21	5	8
317	 Which kind is that?	21	5	8
318	 The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.	21	5	8
319	 Well, I did reopen the fighting pits.	21	5	8
320	 Under my rule, murder will once again become entertainment.	21	5	8
321	 Yes, that was wise.	21	5	8
322	 And you agreed to marry someone you loathe for the greater good.	21	5	8
323	 Very impressive.	21	5	8
324	 My own sister married someone she loathed as well,	21	5	8
325	 though not by choice and certainly not	21	5	8
326	 for the greater good, gods forbid.	21	5	8
327	 She ended up having him killed.	21	5	8
328	 Perhaps it won't come to that.	21	5	8
329	 It's not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.	21	5	8
330	 Varys? King Robert's spymaster?	21	5	8
331	 Yes, he's the one who convinced me to come find you.	21	5	8
332	 He was my travelling companion	21	5	8
333	 before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.	21	5	8
334	 Jorah sent my secrets to Varys.	21	5	8
335	 For 20 years the Spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.	22	5	8
336	 He did what he had to do to survive.	22	5	8
337	 He did a lot of other things as well, things he didn't have to do.	22	5	8
338	 I suspect he's the main reason you weren't slaughtered in your crib.	22	5	8
339	 But you trust him?	22	5	8
340	 Yes, oddly.	22	5	8
341	 He may be the only person in the world I trust.	22	5	8
342	 Except my brother.	22	5	8
343	 The brother who killed my father?	22	5	8
344	 That's the one.	22	5	8
345	 Perhaps I will have you killed after all.	22	5	8
346	 Your queenly prerogative.	22	5	8
347	 I had given up on life	22	5	8
348	 until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for.	22	5	8
349	 If you chop off my head, well,	22	5	8
350	 my final days were interesting.	22	5	8
351	 I'm not going to kill you.	22	5	8
352	 No? Banish me?	22	5	8
353	 No.	22	5	8
354	 So if I'm not going to be murdered	22	5	8
355	 and I'm not going to be banished--	23	5	8
356	 You're going to advise me.	23	5	8
357	 While you can still speak in complete sentences.	23	5	8
358	 Advise you on what?	23	5	8
359	 How to get what I want.	23	5	8
360	 The Iron Throne.	23	5	8
361	 Perhaps you should try wanting something else.	23	5	8
362	 If I want jokes, I'll get myself a proper fool.	23	5	8
363	 I'm not entirely joking.	23	5	8
364	 There's more to the world than Westeros after all.	23	5	8
365	 How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here?	23	5	8
366	 Perhaps this is where you belong,	23	5	8
367	 where you can do the most good.	23	5	8
368	 I fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay	23	5	8
369	 would ever know what it meant to be bought or sold.	23	5	8
370	 I will continue that fight here and beyond.	23	5	8
371	 But this is not my home.	23	5	8
372	 When you get back to your home, who supports you?	23	5	8
373	 The common people.	23	5	8
374	 Let's be generous and assume that's going to happen.	23	5	8
375	 Here in Slaver's Bay, you had the support of the common people	23	5	8
376	 and only the common people.	23	5	8
377	 What was that like? Ruling without the rich?	24	5	8
378	 House Targaryen is gone.	24	5	8
379	 Not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you.	24	5	8
380	 The Starks are gone as well.	24	5	8
381	 Our two terrible fathers saw to that.	24	5	8
382	 The remaining members of House Lannister	24	5	8
383	 will never back you, not ever.	24	5	8
384	 Stannis Baratheon won't back you, either.	24	5	8
385	 His entire claim to the throne rests on the illegitimacy of yours.	24	5	8
386	 That leaves the Tyrells.	24	5	8
387	 Not impossible, not enough.	24	5	8
388	 Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell.	24	5	8
389	 They're all just spokes on a wheel.	24	5	8
390	 This one's on top, then that one's on top.	24	5	8
391	 And on and on it spins, crushing those on the ground.	24	5	8
392	 It's a beautiful dream, stopping the wheel.	24	5	8
393	 You're not the first person who's ever dreamt it.	24	5	8
394	 I'm not going to stop the wheel.	24	5	8
395	 I'm going to break the wheel.	24	5	8
396	 ( grunting )	24	5	8
397	 ( whistles )	25	5	8
398	 You said whoever wins will fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen.	25	5	8
399	 I won.	25	5	8
400	 You struck me.	25	5	8
401	 Have me flogged if it makes you happy.	25	5	8
402	 But I'm the best you've got.	25	5	8
403	 If I win at the Great Pit,	25	5	8
404	 how much can you sell me for?	25	5	8
405	 You're a free man.	25	5	8
406	 You could have gone anywhere.	25	5	8
407	 Why did you come back?	25	5	8
408	 Let me fight for her	25	5	8
409	 and I belong to you.	25	5	8
410	  Thirsty?	25	5	8
411	 Confess.	26	5	8
412	 I'll get out of here, you realize, before long.	26	5	8
413	 Confess.	26	5	8
414	 I can make you a wealthy woman.	26	5	8
415	 A lady of the court.	26	5	8
416	 Confess.	26	5	8
417	 Or I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable.	26	5	8
418	 And all I do is sit here	26	5	8
419	 imagining hideous ways for you to die.	26	5	8
420	 ( door opens )	26	5	8
421	 ( door closes, locks )	26	5	8
422	 ( slurping )	26	5	8
423	 ( wind howling )	27	5	8
424	 Does it hurt?	27	5	8
425	 No.	27	5	8
426	 Good.	27	5	8
427	 How are you?	27	5	8
428	 I'm not the one who got punched and kicked in the face.	27	5	8
429	 You know what I mean.	27	5	8
430	 I'm good.	27	5	8
431	 - Are you scared? - A little.	27	5	8
432	 Me, too.	27	5	8
433	 ( knocks on door )	27	5	8
434	 - Who's there? - Olly.	27	5	8
435	 Oh.	27	5	8
436	 Come in.	27	5	8
437	 I heard what happened.	27	5	8
438	 Oh, not to worry.	27	5	8
439	 Men brawl from time to time. It's only natural.	28	5	8
440	 Figured you were hungry.	28	5	8
441	 Oh, you're a good lad.	28	5	8
442	 Wanted to ask you something	28	5	8
443	 if you've got the time.	28	5	8
444	 I need to check on baby Sam.	28	5	8
445	 ( door closes )	28	5	8
446	  Now then, how can I help?	28	5	8
447	 - It's about the Lord Commander. - Yes?	28	5	8
448	 He's going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings.	28	5	8
449	 Wildlings killed my mom and dad.	28	5	8
450	 They killed everyone in my village.	28	5	8
451	 We've been fighting them for years.	28	5	8
452	 This wasn't a fight.	28	5	8
453	 We were farmers and they slaughtered us.	28	5	8
454	 So why is he saving them?	28	5	8
455	 Wildlings are people.	28	5	8
456	 Just like us, there are good ones and bad ones.	28	5	8
457	 The one he's travelling with, the one with the red beard,	29	5	8
458	 he led the raid on my village.	29	5	8
459	 - Oh, Olly. - How can he trust him?	29	5	8
460	 I've seen the army of the dead.	29	5	8
461	 I've seen the white walkers.	29	5	8
462	 And they're coming for us, for all the living.	29	5	8
463	 And when it's time,	29	5	8
464	 we'll need every last man we can find.	29	5	8
465	 But what if we let the wildlings through the gates	29	5	8
466	 and they cut our throats while we sleep?	29	5	8
467	 Jon's taking a risk, but he has to.	29	5	8
468	 We don't stand a chance otherwise.	29	5	8
469	 Sometimes a man has to make hard choices,	29	5	8
470	 choices that might look wrong to others,	29	5	8
471	 but you know are right in the long run.	29	5	8
472	 You believe that?	29	5	8
473	 With all my heart.	29	5	8
474	 Try not to worry, Olly.	29	5	8
475	 I've been worrying about Jon for years.	29	5	8
476	 He always comes back.	30	5	8
477	 ( wind howling )	30	5	8
478	 ( men grunting )	30	5	8
479	  Turn us about!	30	5	8
480	 You trust me, Jon Snow?	31	5	8
481	 Does that make me a fool?	31	5	8
482	 We're fools together now.	31	5	8
483	 ( man whistles )	31	5	8
484	 Lord of Bones.	31	5	8
485	 Been a long time.	31	5	8
486	 Last time I saw you, the little crow was your prisoner.	31	5	8
487	 The other way around now. What happened?	31	5	8
488	 War.	31	5	8
489	 War? You call that a war?	31	5	8
490	 The greatest army the North has ever seen	32	5	8
491	 cut to pieces by some southern king.	32	5	8
492	 We should gather the elders,	32	5	8
493	 find somewhere quiet to talk.	32	5	8
494	 You don't give the orders here.	32	5	8
495	 I'm not giving an order.	32	5	8
496	 Why aren't you in chains?	32	5	8
497	 He's not my prisoner.	32	5	8
498	 No?	32	5	8
499	 What is he?	32	5	8
500	 We're allies.	32	5	8
501	 You fucking traitor.	32	5	8
502	 You fight for the crows now?	32	5	8
503	 I don't fight for the crows.	32	5	8
504	 We're not here to fight. We're here to talk.	32	5	8
505	 Is that right?	32	5	8
506	 You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund?	32	5	8
507	 And when you're done talking,	32	5	8
508	 do you get down on your knees and suck his cock?	32	5	8
509	 ( grunts )	32	5	8
510	 Gather the elders and let's talk.	33	5	8
511	 ( man coughs )	33	5	8
512	 My name's Jon Snow.	33	5	8
513	 I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.	33	5	8
514	 We're not friends.	33	5	8
515	 We've never been friends.	33	5	8
516	 We won't become friends today.	33	5	8
517	 This isn't about friendship.	33	5	8
518	 This is about survival.	34	5	8
519	 This is about putting a 700-foot wall	34	5	8
520	 between you and what's out there.	34	5	8
521	 You built that wall to keep us out.	34	5	8
522	 Since when do the crows give two shits if we live?	34	5	8
523	  In normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times.	34	5	8
524	 The white walkers don't care if a man's free folk or crow.	34	5	8
525	 We're all the same to them, meat for their army.	34	5	8
526	 But together we can beat them.	34	5	8
527	 Beat the white walkers?	34	5	8
528	 Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe.	34	5	8
529	 It's not a trick.	34	5	8
530	 It's a gift for those who join us.	34	5	8
531	 Dragonglass.	34	5	8
532	 A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers	34	5	8
533	 to kill a walker.	34	5	8
534	 - You saw this? - No.	35	5	8
535	 But I trust the man.	35	5	8
536	 There are old stories about dragonglass.	35	5	8
537	 There are old stories about ice spiders as big as hounds.	35	5	8
538	 And with the things we've seen, you don't believe them?	35	5	8
539	  Come with me and I'll share these weapons.	35	5	8
540	 Come with you where?	35	5	8
541	  There are good lands south of the Wall.	35	5	8
542	 The Night's Watch will let you through the tunnel	35	5	8
543	 and allow your people to farm those lands.	35	5	8
544	 ( murmuring )	35	5	8
545	 I knew Mance Rayder.	35	5	8
546	 He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch.	35	5	8
547	 He wanted a new life for his people, for you.	35	5	8
548	 We're prepared to give you that new life.	35	5	8
549	 If?	35	5	8
550	 If you swear you'll join us when the real war begins.	35	5	8
551	 Where is Mance?	35	5	8
552	 - He died. - How?	35	5	8
553	 I put an arrow through his heart.	35	5	8
554	 - ( wildlings shouting ) -  Hey, hey.	35	5	8
555	 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.	36	5	8
556	 Hey, hey, hey.	36	5	8
557	  I say we send the Lord Commander	36	5	8
558	 back to Castle Black with no eyes.	36	5	8
559	 Hey, none of you saw Mance die.	36	5	8
560	 I did.	36	5	8
561	 The southern king who broke our army, Stannis,	36	5	8
562	 wanted to burn him alive to send us a message.	36	5	8
563	 Jon Snow defied that cunt's orders.	36	5	8
564	 His arrow was mercy.	36	5	8
565	 What he did took courage.	36	5	8
566	 And that's what we need today,	36	5	8
567	 the courage to make peace	36	5	8
568	 with men we've been killing for generations.	36	5	8
569	 I lost my father, my uncle,	36	5	8
570	 and two brothers fighting the damn crows.	36	5	8
571	 I'm not asking you to forget your dead.	36	5	8
572	 I'll never forget mine.	36	5	8
573	 I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the Wall.	36	5	8
574	 But I'm asking you	36	5	8
575	 to think about your children now.	36	5	8
576	 They'll never have children of their own	37	5	8
577	 if we don't band together.	37	5	8
578	 The Long Night is coming	37	5	8
579	 and the dead come with it.	37	5	8
580	 No clan can stop them.	37	5	8
581	 The free folk can't stop them.	37	5	8
582	 The Night's Watch can't stop them.	37	5	8
583	 And all the southern kings can't stop them.	37	5	8
584	 Only together, all of us.	37	5	8
585	 And even then it may not be enough,	37	5	8
586	 but at least we'll give the fuckers a fight.	37	5	8
587	 You vouch for this man, Tormund?	37	5	8
588	 He's prettier than both my daughters,	37	5	8
589	 but he knows how to fight.	37	5	8
590	 He's young, but he knows how to lead.	37	5	8
591	 He didn't have to come to Hardhome.	37	5	8
592	 He came because he needs us	38	5	8
593	 and we need him.	38	5	8
594	 My ancestors would spit on me	38	5	8
595	 if I broke bread with a crow.	38	5	8
596	 So would mine, but fuck 'em, they're dead.	38	5	8
597	 ( sighs )	38	5	8
598	 I'll never trust a man in black.	38	5	8
599	 But I trust you, Tormund.	38	5	8
600	 If you say this is the way,	38	5	8
601	 we're with you.	38	5	8
602	 - This is the way. - ( murmuring )	38	5	8
603	  I'm with Tormund.	38	5	8
604	 We stay here, we're dead men.	38	5	8
605	 At least with King Crow, there's a chance.	38	5	8
606	 ( giant growls )	38	5	8
607	 Tormund.	39	5	8

248	 Sam, are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?	16	2	2
249	 - I didn't touch her. - No, you just want to steal her.	17	2	2
250	 What do you think Craster cuts off for that?	17	2	2
251	 I can't steal her.	17	2	2
252	 She's a person, not a goat.	17	2	2
253	 We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory.	17	2	2
254	 We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it.	17	2	2
255	 And even if he would, what would we do with her?	17	2	2
256	 Who's going to deliver a baby, you?	17	2	2
257	 I could try.	17	2	2
258	 What? I've read about it.	17	2	2
259	 A bit.	17	2	2
260	 I'm sorry, Sam.	17	2	2
261	 We can't help her.	17	2	2
262	 Khaleesi.	18	2	2
263	 - You don't need to see this. - He is blood of my blood.	19	2	2
264	 - Who did this? - Khal Pono, perhaps.	19	2	2
265	 Khal Jhaqo.	19	2	2
266	 They don't like the idea of a woman leading a Khalasar.	19	2	2
267	 They will like it far less when I am done with them.	19	2	2
268	 Is it as you remember, My Lord?	21	2	2
269	 It looks smaller.	21	2	2
270	 Everything looks bigger when you're a child.	21	2	2
271	 I remember my father's cabin	21	2	2
272	 felt like a palace when I was little.	21	2	2
273	 Now look at it.	21	2	2
274	 They'll be waiting for me on the docks.	21	2	2
275	 Who will?	21	2	2
276	 Anyone who matters.	22	2	2
277	 This is a big day for them.	22	2	2
278	 They haven't had much to get excited about since I left.	22	2	2
279	 It's a hard place, the Iron Islands.	22	2	2
280	 Always has been.	22	2	2
281	 It's cold and it's wet.	22	2	2
282	 Oh, I love the cold and wet.	22	2	2
283	 They say hard places breed hard men.	22	2	2
284	 And hard men rule the world.	22	2	2
285	 Then you'll be king before long.	22	2	2
286	 Try smiling with your lips closed.	22	2	2
287	 Better.	22	2	2
288	 My father doesn't trust you Iron islanders.	22	2	2
289	 I don't blame him.	22	2	2
290	 He says that you're all reavers and rapers	22	2	2
291	 and that no matter how many women you have,	22	2	2
292	 you'll never be sat-- uh!	22	2	2
293	 Quit talking about your father.	22	2	2
294	 But he's right about us.	22	2	2
295	 Our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding.	23	2	2
296	 That's not enough for us.	23	2	2
297	 That's why we take salt wives--	23	2	2
298	 the women we capture.	23	2	2
299	 Capture me.	23	2	2
300	 Take me with you when you go ashore.	23	2	2
301	 - Make me your salt wife. - Your place is on this ship.	23	2	2
302	 Not after you leave.	23	2	2
303	 Father will punish me.	23	2	2
304	 He'll call me a whore.	23	2	2
305	 I haven't paid you.	23	2	2
306	 Oh, yeah.	23	2	2
307	 - I paid good money...	23	2	2
308	 I'm not going to stand for this.	24	2	2
309	 I barely touched her.	24	2	2
310	 Now, you charge twice as much as every other brothel	24	2	2
311	 and this is what I get-- crying.	24	2	2
312	 One moment, my friend. A moment.	24	2	2
313	 Please accept my sincerest apologies.	24	2	2
314	 Aremca will take good care of you.	24	2	2
315	 - I'm sorry, My Lord. - Shh, shh.	25	2	2
316	 Did he hurt you?	25	2	2
317	 No, My Lord.	25	2	2
318	 It's Mhaegen.	25	2	2
319	 Who?	25	2	2
320	 She works for you.	25	2	2
321	 She's the one-- the Gold Cloaks,	25	2	2
322	 - they killed her baby. - Ah, yes.	25	2	2
323	 That was...	25	2	2
324	 poorly handled.	25	2	2
325	 Sometimes those with the most power	25	2	2
326	 have the least grace.	25	2	2
327	 I can't stop thinking about it.	25	2	2
328	 I can't sleep.	25	2	2
329	 That poor little baby.	26	2	2
330	 You know, you remind me of another girl,	26	2	2
331	 a lovely thing I once acquired	26	2	2
332	 from a Lysene pleasure house--	26	2	2
333	 beautiful, like yourself,	26	2	2
334	 and intelligent, like yourself.	26	2	2
335	 But she wasn't happy.	26	2	2
336	 She cried often.	26	2	2
337	 I asked her why, but we didn't have	26	2	2
338	 the kind of rapport that you and I have.	26	2	2
339	 Yes, it was quite sad.	26	2	2
340	 Girls from the Lysene pleasure houses are expensive,	26	2	2
341	 extremely expensive.	26	2	2
342	 And this one wasn't making me any money.	26	2	2
343	 I hate bad investments.	27	2	2
344	 Really, I-- I do.	27	2	2
345	 They haunt me.	27	2	2
346	 I had no idea how to make her happy,	27	2	2
347	 no idea how to mitigate my losses.	27	2	2
348	 A very wealthy patron, he offered me	27	2	2
349	 a tremendous amount of money	27	2	2
350	 to let him transform this lovely, sad girl.	27	2	2
351	 To use her in ways that...	27	2	2
352	 Would never occur to most men.	27	2	2
353	 And you know what occurs to most men.	27	2	2
354	 I would not say he succeeded in making her happy,	27	2	2
355	 but my losses were definitely mitigated.	27	2	2
356	 Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen's child.	28	2	2
357	 I'll see you tomorrow.	28	2	2
358	 And you'll be happy?	28	2	2
359	 That makes me happy.	28	2	2
360	 More wine?	28	2	2
361	 - Damn it, boy! - Apologies, My Lord.	28	2	2
362	 Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine.	28	2	2
363	 That's your new squire?	28	2	2
364	 I could've found you a proper lad.	28	2	2
365	 Myself, I prefer the improper ones.	28	2	2
366	 Mm, that's a good red. Dornish?	28	2	2
367	 You know your wines, My Lord.	28	2	2
368	 That I do.	29	2	2
369	 A fine dinner, My Lord.	29	2	2
370	 Call me Tyrion, please.	29	2	2
371	 I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners,	29	2	2
372	 now that you're a lord.	29	2	2
373	 Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.	29	2	2
374	 Wars have been started for less.	29	2	2
375	 I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.	29	2	2
376	 Mm, nasty business.	29	2	2
377	 - Had to be done. - Yes, of course.	29	2	2
378	 The City Watch must keep the peace,	29	2	2
379	 only I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies.	29	2	2
380	 - Orders are orders. - Quite right.	29	2	2
381	 Especially the queen's orders.	29	2	2
382	 I never said they were the queen's orders.	29	2	2
383	 No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards?	29	2	2
384	 She's always been a jealous woman.	29	2	2
385	 You know your sister better than I do.	29	2	2
386	 You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister?	29	2	2
387	 I don't listen to filth.	29	2	2
388	 That's good of you, but you have heard them.	29	2	2
389	 I suppose people who do believe that filth consider Robert's bastards	29	2	2
390	 to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children.	30	2	2
391	 Joffrey is my king. The rest doesn't interest me.	30	2	2
392	 I appreciate your loyalty.	30	2	2
393	 Tell me, when your men slaughtered Ned Stark's men	30	2	2
394	 in the throne room, did you give the order?	30	2	2
395	 I did.	30	2	2
396	 And I would again.	30	2	2
397	 The man was a traitor.	30	2	2
398	 He tried to buy my loyalty.	30	2	2
399	 The fool.	30	2	2
400	 He had no idea you were already bought.	30	2	2
401	 Are you drunk?	30	2	2
402	 I'll not have my honor questioned by an Imp!	30	2	2
403	 I'm not questioning Your Honor, Lord Janos.	30	2	2
404	 I'm denying its existence.	30	2	2
405	 If you think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf--	30	2	2
406	 Dwarf? Mm, you should have stopped at Imp.	30	2	2
407	 And, yes, you will stand here and take it from me,	30	2	2
408	 unless you'd like to take it from my friend here.	30	2	2
409	 I intend to serve as Hand of the King	30	2	2
410	 until my father returns from the war.	30	2	2
411	 And seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King,	31	2	2
412	 well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about.	31	2	2
413	 What are you t--	31	2	2
414	 my friends at court will not allow this!	31	2	2
415	 - The queen herself has granted-- - The queen regent.	31	2	2
416	 And you're a fool to believe she is your friend.	31	2	2
417	 We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this.	31	2	2
418	 No, we shan't.	31	2	2
419	 There's a ship leaving for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea tonight.	31	2	2
420	 From there I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black.	31	2	2
421	 I hope you enjoy the Wall.	31	2	2
422	 I found it surprisingly beautiful...	31	2	2
423	 In a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way.	31	2	2
424	 The lads will escort you.	31	2	2
425	 The streets aren't safe at night, My Lord.	31	2	2
426	 These men are under my command!	31	2	2
427	 I command you to arrest this cutthroat.	31	2	2
428	 His name is Bronn	31	2	2
429	 and he is the new commander of the City Watch.	31	2	2
430	 Boys.	32	2	2
431	 I have friends at court,	32	2	2
432	 powerful friends!	32	2	2
433	 The king himself made me a lord!	32	2	2
434	 To the new Commander.	32	2	2
435	 If I told you to murder an infant girl, say,	32	2	2
436	 still at her mother's breast,	32	2	2
437	 would you do it without question?	32	2	2
438	 Without question? No.	32	2	2
439	" I'd ask, ""how much?"""	32	2	2
440	 If they come back, I say we yield.	33	2	2
441	 Gendry's the one they want.	33	2	2
442	 Don't want to get caught in the middle of a battle.	33	2	2
443	 I ain't afraid of no battles.	33	2	2
444	 If you got within a mile of a battle, you'd fill your pants.	33	2	2
445	 I've seen lots of battles.	33	2	2
446	 - I saw-- - Liar.	33	2	2
447	 I saw a man kill another man	33	2	2
448	 just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom.	33	2	2
449	 Stabbed him right in the neck.	33	2	2
450	 Two men fighting isn't a battle.	33	2	2
451	 - They had armor on. - So?	33	2	2
452	 So, if they've got armor on, it's a battle.	33	2	2
453	 No, it isn't.	33	2	2
454	 What does a dyer's apprentice know about battles anyway?	33	2	2
455	 Gendry's an armorer's apprentice.	33	2	2
456	 Hot pie, tell Gendry what makes a fight into a battle.	33	2	2
457	 It's, um, when they've got armor on.	33	2	2
458	 Who told you that?	33	2	2
459	 A knight.	33	2	2
460	 How'd you know he was a knight?	33	2	2
461	 Well, it was 'cause he got armor on.	34	2	2
462	 You don't have to be a knight to have armor.	34	2	2
463	 Any idiot can buy armor.	34	2	2
464	 How do you know?	34	2	2
465	 'Cause I sold armor.	34	2	2
466	 What do the Gold Cloaks want with you?	34	2	2
467	 - No idea. - You're a liar.	34	2	2
468	 You know, you shouldn't insult people that are bigger than you.	34	2	2
469	 Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone.	34	2	2
470	 I don't care what any of them want.	34	2	2
471	 No good's ever come of their questions.	34	2	2
472	 No good's ever come?	34	2	2
473	 Who asked questions before?	34	2	2
474	 How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass?	34	2	2
475	 Who asked questions?	34	2	2
476	 The Hand of the King.	34	2	2
477	 Hands of the King.	34	2	2
478	 Lord Arryn came first a few weeks before he died,	35	2	2
479	 and then Lord Stark came a few weeks before he died.	35	2	2
480	 Lord Stark?	35	2	2
481	 See? Asking me questions is bad luck.	35	2	2
482	 You'll probably be dead soon.	35	2	2
483	 - What did they ask about? - My mom.	35	2	2
484	 - Who's your mom? - Just my mom--	35	2	2
485	 worked in a tavern, died when I was little.	35	2	2
486	 And who was your father?	35	2	2
487	 Could've been one of those gold-hatted bastards, for all I know.	35	2	2
488	 What about you anyway?	35	2	2
489	 You thought they were after you.	35	2	2
490	 Why?	35	2	2
491	 Did you kill someone or is it just because you're a girl?	35	2	2
492	 - I'm not a girl. - Yes, you are.	35	2	2
493	 Do you think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?	35	2	2
494	 Stupider.	35	2	2
495	 The Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that.	35	2	2
496	 Yeah, that's true, but you're still a girl.	35	2	2
497	 I am not!	35	2	2
498	 Yeah? Well, pull your cock out and take a piss, then.	35	2	2
499	 I don't need to take a piss.	36	2	2
500	 Lommy and hot pie can't know.	36	2	2
501	 No one can know.	36	2	2
502	 Well, they won't, not from me.	36	2	2
503	 My name's not Arry.	36	2	2
504	 It's Arya... of House Stark.	36	2	2
505	 Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.	36	2	2
506	 He was your father-- the Hand, the traitor.	36	2	2
507	 He was never a traitor.	36	2	2
508	 Joffrey is a liar.	36	2	2
509	 So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady.	36	2	2
510	 No. I mean, yes.	36	2	2
511	 My mother was a lady and my sister--	36	2	2
512	 Yeah, but you were a lord's daughter	36	2	2
513	 and you lived in a castle and you--	36	2	2
514	 look, all that about cocks, I should never have said--	36	2	2
515	 and I've been pissing in front of you and everything.	36	2	2
516	" I-- I should be calling you ""My Lady."""	36	2	2
517	" - Do not call me ""My Lady."" - As My Lady commands."	37	2	2
518	 Well, that was unladylike.	37	2	2
519	 Oh!	37	2	2
520	 What's she carrying?	37	2	2
521	 Myrish oranges,	37	2	2
522	 wine from the Arbor...	37	2	2
523	 And the heir to Pyke and the Iron Islands.	37	2	2
524	 The only living son of Balon Greyjoy.	37	2	2
525	 Me.	38	2	2
526	 I don't like wine.	38	2	2
527	 Woman's drink.	38	2	2
528	 I need to get to Pyke.	38	2	2
529	 I'll find you a horse.	38	2	2
530	 I'm heading that way. I can take you there.	38	2	2
531	 I bet you can.	38	2	2
532	 Have you been at sea long?	38	2	2
533	 Or were there just no women where you came from?	38	2	2
534	 - None like you. - You don't know what I'm like.	38	2	2
535	 Maybe you don't know what you're like.	38	2	2
536	 Maybe you need someone to teach you.	38	2	2
537	 Do you know who I am?	39	2	2
538	 You think I offer free rides to every man in jewelry,	39	2	2
539	 Lord Greyjoy?	39	2	2
540	 Have my things sent up to the castle.	39	2	2
541	 You should give me the reins.	39	2	2
542	 I'm a better rider than you.	39	2	2
543	 I've been on horseback for the past nine years.	39	2	2
544	 Nine years?	39	2	2
545	 Do you still know your way around a ship?	39	2	2
546	 Have these hands ever touched a rope?	39	2	2
547	 Don't you worry about my hands.	39	2	2
548	 The sea is in my blood.	39	2	2
549	 Your blood will be in the sea if I don't watch where I'm going.	39	2	2
550	 I have a proposal for my father,	39	2	2
551	 one that will make him king again,	40	2	2
552	 and me after him.	40	2	2
553	 You may get to stay in a castle tonight if you're lucky.	40	2	2
554	 Is that an offer from my future king?	40	2	2
555	 An order from your future king.	40	2	2
556	 You can tell your grandchildren about this night.	40	2	2
557	 I don't imagine it will be a story fit for children.	40	2	2
558	 Father.	40	2	2
559	 Nine years, is it?	40	2	2
560	 They took a frightened boy.	40	2	2
561	 What have they given back?	40	2	2
562	 A man.	40	2	2
563	 - Your blood and your heir. - We shall see.	40	2	2
564	 Stark had you longer than I did.	41	2	2
565	 Lord Stark is gone.	41	2	2
566	 And how do you feel about that?	41	2	2
567	 What's done is done.	41	2	2
568	 I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.	41	2	2
569	 Who gave you those clothes?	41	2	2
570	 Was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter?	41	2	2
571	 If my clothes offend you, I will change them.	41	2	2
572	 You will.	41	2	2
573	 That bauble 'round your neck--	41	2	2
574	 did you pay the iron price for it or the gold?	41	2	2
575	 I asked a question.	41	2	2
576	 Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made	41	2	2
577	 or did you buy it to match your fine clothes?	41	2	2
578	 Iron or gold?	41	2	2
579	 Gold.	42	2	2
580	 I'll not have my son dressed as a whore.	42	2	2
581	 My fears have come true--	42	2	2
582	 the Starks have made you theirs.	42	2	2
583	 - My blood is salt and iron. - Yet the Stark boy sends you to me	42	2	2
584	 like a trained raven clutching his message.	42	2	2
585	 The offer he makes is one I proposed.	42	2	2
586	 - He heeds your counsel? - I've lived with him,	42	2	2
587	 hunted with him, fought at his side.	42	2	2
588	 He thinks of me as a brother.	42	2	2
589	 No, not here, not in my hearing.	42	2	2
590	 You will not name him brother,	42	2	2
591	 this son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword.	42	2	2
592	 Or have you forgotten your own blood?	42	2	2
593	 I forget nothing.	42	2	2
594	 I remember my brothers.	42	2	2
595	 And I remember when my father was a king.	42	2	2
596	 I see.	43	2	2
597	 I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him	43	2	2
598	 and he will make me king of the Iron Islands once again.	43	2	2
599	 - I will lead the attack myself. - Oh, you will?	43	2	2
600	 I'm your son, your only living heir.	43	2	2
601	 Who else?	43	2	2
602	 I told you to wait outside.	43	2	2
603	 How did you get past the guards?	43	2	2
604	 Anything with a cock is easy to fool.	43	2	2
605	 My dear.	43	2	2
606	 Yara?	43	2	2
607	 So good to see you, brother.	43	2	2
608	 This is a homecoming I'll tell my grandchildren about.	43	2	2
609	 She can't lead an attack!	44	2	2
610	 - And why not? - You're a woman!	44	2	2
611	 - You're the one in skirts. - This isn't Winterfell, boy.	44	2	2
612	 Your sister took over command of your eldest brother's ship	44	2	2
613	 after your new father killed him.	44	2	2
614	 What's dead may never die.	44	2	2
615	 The only nights she's spent off these islands	44	2	2
616	 have been spent on the sea.	44	2	2
617	 She's commanded men.	44	2	2
618	 She's killed men.	44	2	2
619	 She knows who she is.	44	2	2
620	 No man gives me a crown.	44	2	2
621	 I pay the iron price.	44	2	2
622	 I will take my crown,	44	2	2
623	 for that is who I am.	44	2	2
624	 That is who we have always been.	44	2	2
625	 You won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own.	44	2	2
626	 Who said anything about the Lannisters?	45	2	2
627	 You'll have your gold	45	2	2
628	 when we take the treasury at King's Landing.	45	2	2
629	 All these kings fighting for the throne,	45	2	2
630	 and this Stannis has the smallest army.	45	2	2
631	 Why would I bet on the man with the worst chance?	45	2	2
632	 Because you're a smart gambler.	45	2	2
633	 Stannis has proved himself in war twice.	45	2	2
634	 His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield.	45	2	2
635	 Neither has the false King Joffrey.	45	2	2
636	 And yet they both have larger armies.	45	2	2
637	 Stannis has just begun the fight.	45	2	2
638	 His Bannermen will rally to his cause.	45	2	2
639	 There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms	45	2	2
640	 more honorable than Stannis Baratheon	45	2	2
641	 or more worthy of loyalty.	45	2	2
642	 What is the world coming to	45	2	2
643	 when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings?	45	2	2
644	 - Mind your words, pirate. - Matthos.	45	2	2
645	 You think I'm insulted?	45	2	2
646	 I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate.	46	2	2
647	 I don't sail for promises.	46	2	2
648	 Of course you do.	46	2	2
649	 Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise--	46	2	2
650	 a promise that somewhere on the sea,	46	2	2
651	 somebody's got some gold and you can take it from him.	46	2	2
652	 - That's a promise that always comes true. - As is mine.	46	2	2
653	 You're not a young man, Salladhor.	46	2	2
654	 And correct me if I'm wrong--	46	2	2
655	 most pirates don't grow old.	46	2	2
656	 Only the clever ones.	46	2	2
657	 You want to spend your last few years on the sea	46	2	2
658	 stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers	46	2	2
659	 and Meereenese silk merchants?	46	2	2
660	 Then go. They're out there waiting for you.	46	2	2
661	 That's easy.	46	2	2
662	 What I'm offering you is hard.	46	2	2
663	 Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros.	46	2	2
664	 You'll be the richest man in Lys and the most famous.	46	2	2
665	 They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing.	46	2	2
666	" ""Salladhor Saan"" is a good name for songs."	46	2	2
667	 - It is. - One thing-- I want the queen.	46	2	2
668	 - The queen? - Cersei-- I want her.	47	2	2
669	 I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships.	47	2	2
670	 And if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay,	47	2	2
671	 I will fuck this blonde queen and I'll fuck her well.	47	2	2
672	 This war isn't about you.	47	2	2
673	 We're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the queen.	47	2	2
674	 I'm not going to rape her. I'm going to fuck her.	47	2	2
675	 As if she would just let you.	47	2	2
676	 You don't know how persuasive I am.	47	2	2
677	 I've never tried to fuck you.	47	2	2
678	 Stannis is the rightful king and the Lord of Light,	47	2	2
679	 the one true God--	47	2	2
680	 I've been all over the world, my boy,	47	2	2
681	 and everywhere I go, people tell me about the true Gods.	47	2	2
682	 They all think they found the right one.	47	2	2
683	 The one true God is what's between a woman's legs,	47	2	2
684	 and better yet, a queen's legs.	47	2	2
685	 I never thought you'd have a true believer for a son.	47	2	2
686	 Eh, he's young yet.	47	2	2
687	 I promise you the gold. I promise you the glory.	48	2	2
688	 I cannot promise you the queen.	48	2	2
689	 You believe your king can win?	48	2	2
690	 He is the one true king.	48	2	2
691	 You Westerosi are funny people.	48	2	2
692	 A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him.	48	2	2
693	 I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth.	48	2	2
694	 You're the most honest smuggler I ever met.	48	2	2
695	 Make me rich.	48	2	2
696	 Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will.	48	2	2
697	 When will the king have us sail?	48	2	2
698	 As soon as his God wills it.	48	2	2
699	 He's my God, too, and yours,	48	2	2
700	 but you are too blind to see.	48	2	2
701	 - Let me teach you how to read. - Oh, you and your mother.	49	2	2
702	 It won't take long. You already know the letters.	49	2	2
703	 The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be.	49	2	2
704	 I wish I had a God, truly.	49	2	2
705	 I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every God there is--	49	2	2
706	 pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home.	49	2	2
707	 - None of it works. - But you always came home.	49	2	2
708	 - I wasn't praying. - No, but I was.	49	2	2
709	 Every night that you were at sea,	49	2	2
710	 I lit a candle and I prayed for you.	49	2	2
711	 You want me to have a God?	49	2	2
712	 Fine. King Stannis is my God.	49	2	2
713	 He raised me up and blessed me with his trust.	49	2	2
714	 He gave you a future I could never have imagined.	49	2	2
715	 You know how to read. You'll be a knight someday.	49	2	2
716	 You think a fire God commanded all that?	49	2	2
717	 It was Stannis, only Stannis.	49	2	2
718	 Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.	49	2	2
719	 Don't tell him that.	49	2	2
720	 Lord Janos Slynt was commander of the City Watch.	50	2	2
721	 You had no right to exile him.	50	2	2
722	 I have every right. I am the King's Hand.	50	2	2
723	 You're serving as the King's Hand till father gets here.	50	2	2
724	 I am Queen Regent.	50	2	2
725	 Listen to me, Queen Regent.	50	2	2
726	 You're losing the people.	50	2	2
727	 - Do you hear me? -  The people.	50	2	2
728	 You think I care?	50	2	2
729	 You might find it difficult	50	2	2
730	 to rule over millions who want you dead.	50	2	2
731	 Half the city will starve when winter comes.	50	2	2
732	 The other half will plot to overthrow you.	50	2	2
733	 And your gold-plated thugs just gave them	50	2	2
734	 their rallying cry--	50	2	2
735	" ""The Queen slaughters babies."""	50	2	2
736	 You don't even have the decency to deny it.	50	2	2
737	 It wasn't you who gave the order, was it?	50	2	2
738	 Joffrey didn't even tell you.	50	2	2
739	 Did he tell you?	51	2	2
740	 I imagine that would be even worse.	51	2	2
741	 He did what needed to be done.	51	2	2
742	 You want to be Hand of the King? You want to rule?	51	2	2
743	 This is what ruling is-- lying on a bed of weeds,	51	2	2
744	 ripping them out by the root, one by one,	51	2	2
745	 before they strangle you in your sleep.	51	2	2
746	 I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling than that.	51	2	2
747	 I don't care what you think!	51	2	2
748	 You've never taken it seriously.	51	2	2
749	 You haven't, Jaime hasn't.	51	2	2
750	 It's all fallen on me.	51	2	2
751	 As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon.	51	2	2
752	 You're funny.	51	2	2
753	 You've always been funny...	51	2	2
754	 But none of your jokes will ever match	51	2	2
755	 the first one, will they?	52	2	2
756	 You remember?	52	2	2
757	 Back when you ripped my mother open	52	2	2
758	 on your way out of her and she bled to death?	52	2	2
759	 She was my mother, too.	52	2	2
760	 Mother gone...	52	2	2
761	 For the sake of you.	52	2	2
762	 There's no bigger joke in the world than that.	52	2	2
763	 - Your Grace. - Your Grace.	52	2	2
764	 How did you fare with your pirate?	52	2	2
765	 Salladhor Saan will join our fleet-- 30 ships.	53	2	2
766	 His men know how to fight.	53	2	2
767	 In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men.	53	2	2
768	 It does seem the wiser choice.	53	2	2
769	 There won't be a choice this time.	53	2	2
770	 Do you trust him?	53	2	2
771	 Salladhor Saan is an old friend.	53	2	2
772	 I've known him 30 years.	53	2	2
773	 I've never trusted him,	53	2	2
774	 but once he gets the smell of gold, he never stops.	53	2	2
775	 Well, if he does his job, he'll have his share.	53	2	2
776	 Leave us.	53	2	2
777	 At once, Your Grace.	53	2	2
778	 The Lord of Light shines through you, young warrior.	53	2	2
779	 Come.	54	2	2
780	 What did you say to him?	54	2	2
781	 I told him death by fire is the purest death.	54	2	2
782	 - Why? - Because it is true.	54	2	2
783	 You're troubled, my king.	54	2	2
784	 Yeah.	54	2	2
785	 These armies are toys for the Lord of Light.	54	2	2
786	 Tell your lord to burn them, then.	54	2	2
787	 I tell him nothing.	54	2	2
788	 I pray for his commands and I obey.	54	2	2
789	 My little brother has 100,000 men according to the scouts,	54	2	2
790	 men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.	54	2	2
791	 You must have faith.	54	2	2
792	 Faith?	54	2	2
793	 In a real war, the side with the greater number wins	54	2	2
794	 nine times out of 10.	55	2	2
795	 Then we must be the 10th.	55	2	2
796	 I cannot defeat my brother in the field.	55	2	2
797	 And I can't take King's Landing without the men he's stolen.	55	2	2
798	 I have seen the path to victory in the flames.	55	2	2
799	 But first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light.	55	2	2
800	 I've said the words, damn you.	55	2	2
801	 I burnt the idols.	55	2	2
802	 You must give all of yourself.	55	2	2
803	 I have a wife.	55	2	2
804	 I took a vow.	55	2	2
805	 She's sickly, weak...	55	2	2
806	 Shut away in a tower.	56	2	2
807	 She disgusts you.	56	2	2
808	 And she's given you nothing--	56	2	2
809	 no sons, only stillborns,	56	2	2
810	 only death.	56	2	2
811	 I will give you a son, my king.	56	2	2
812	 A son?	56	2	2
0	  Tomorrow you'll ride south to the Stormlands.	0	2	3
1	 I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon.	0	2	3
2	 If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one.	0	2	3
3	 I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital.	0	2	3
4	 But I am very good at keeping secrets from my good friends.	0	2	3
5	 Your discretion is legendary.	0	2	3
6	 You in command here? I have a royal warrant	0	2	3
7	 for one of these gutter rats you're transporting.	0	2	3
8	 We're looking for a boy named Gendry.	0	2	3
9	 We'll be back with more men.	0	2	3
10	 This is Gilly. She's one of Craster's daughters.	0	2	3
11	 We have to take her with us when we leave.	0	2	3
12	 I'm going to have a baby. If it's a boy...	0	2	3
13	 If it's a boy, what?	0	2	3
14	 Seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King,	0	2	3
15	 well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about.	0	2	3
16	 - The queen herself-- - The queen regent.	0	2	3
17	 And you're a fool to believe she is your friend.	0	2	3
18	 I hope you enjoy the Wall.	0	2	3
19	 I have friends at court!	0	2	3
20	 To the new Commander.	0	2	3
21	 I need to get to Pyke.	1	2	3
22	 I'm heading that way, Lord Greyjoy.	1	2	3
23	  I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him	1	2	3
24	 and he will make me king of the Iron Islands once again.	1	2	3
25	 - I will lead the attack myself. - Oh, you will?	1	2	3
26	 I'm your son, who else? Yara?	1	2	3
27	 - So good to see you, brother. - She can't lead an attack.	1	2	3
28	 She's commanded men. She's killed men.	1	2	3
29	 No man gives me a crown. I will take my crown.	1	2	3
30	 ( Wind howling )	1	2	3
31	 ( Baby fussing )	1	2	3
32	 ( Baby crying )	1	2	3
33	 ( Gasps )	1	2	3
34	 ( Theme music playing )	1	2	3
35		1	2	3
36		1	2	3
37	 	2	2	3
38	 ( Grunts )	3	2	3
39	 Out, all of you.	3	2	3
40	 Bastard's been meddling where he shouldn't!	3	2	3
41	 I want you and your men	4	2	3
42	 gone.	4	2	3
43	 And you will make this right.	4	2	3
44	 ( Spits )	4	2	3
45	 Wait outside.	4	2	3
46	 - Lord Commander. - Now!	4	2	3
47	 - Lord Commander. - Leave us.	4	2	3
48	 What did you do?	4	2	3
49	 I followed him.	4	2	3
50	 He took the baby into the woods, the newborn.	4	2	3
51	 What business is that of yours?	4	2	3
52	 No, you don't understand.	4	2	3
53	 He's killing them, all the boys.	5	2	3
54	 You know.	5	2	3
55	 The wildlings serve crueler Gods than you or I.	5	2	3
56	 Those boys are Craster's offerings.	5	2	3
57	 Offerings?	5	2	3
58	 He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.	5	2	3
59	 Aye, many a time that monster has been the difference	5	2	3
60	 between life and death for our Rangers.	5	2	3
61	 Your Uncle among them.	5	2	3
62	 We have other wars to fight out there.	5	2	3
63	 Like it or not, we need men like Craster.	5	2	3
64	 I...	5	2	3
65	 I saw it.	5	2	3
66	 I saw...	6	2	3
67	 Something take that child.	6	2	3
68	 Yeah.	6	2	3
69	 Whatever it was,	6	2	3
70	 I daresay you'll see it again.	6	2	3
71	 Now ready my horse.	6	2	3
72	 We leave at dawn.	6	2	3
73	 Don't lose it again.	6	2	3
74	 - ( Men shouting ) - ( Birds squawking )	6	2	3
75	 ( Horse whinnies )	6	2	3
76	 Gilly.	6	2	3
77	 You're leaving.	7	2	3
78	 I-- I wanted to give you something.	7	2	3
79	 It belonged to my mother.	7	2	3
80	 - I can't take it. - Please.	7	2	3
81	 I want you to.	7	2	3
82	 My mother used it for sewing.	7	2	3
83	 She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed	7	2	3
84	 and I'd read to her.	7	2	3
85	 My father put a stop to it when he found out.	7	2	3
86	 It's the only thing I have of hers.	7	2	3
87	 She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.	7	2	3
88	 You--	7	2	3
89	 you shouldn't give it away.	7	2	3
90	 I'm not giving it away.	7	2	3
91	 I'm giving it to you.	8	2	3
92	 Keep it safe for me.	8	2	3
93	 Till I come back.	8	2	3
94	 ( Goats bleating )	8	2	3
95	 ( Wolf panting )	8	2	3
96	 Hodor.	8	2	3
97	 Hodor.	8	2	3
98	 Rouse Bran, will you? It's time for his lessons.	8	2	3
99	 ( Gasps )	9	2	3
100	 ( Breathing heavily )	9	2	3
101	  Every night it's the same.	9	2	3
102	 I'm walking	9	2	3
103	 and running, but...	9	2	3
104	 I'm not-- I'm not me.	9	2	3
105	 I'm running through the Godswood,	9	2	3
106	 sniffing the dirt,	9	2	3
107	 tasting blood in my mouth when I've made a fresh kill,	9	2	3
108	 howling.	9	2	3
109	 Old Nan used to tell me stories	9	2	3
110	 about magical people who could live	9	2	3
111	 inside stags, birds, wolves.	9	2	3
112	 That's exactly what they are, Bran--	9	2	3
113	 - stories. - So she was lying?	9	2	3
114	 - They don't exist? - Well, they may have done.	10	2	3
115	 But they're gone from the world	10	2	3
116	 along with much else.	10	2	3
117	 These are dreams, Bran,	10	2	3
118	 nothing more.	10	2	3
119	 No, my dreams are different.	10	2	3
120	 Mine are true.	10	2	3
121	 I dreamt of my father dying.	10	2	3
122	 And Rickon had the same dream.	10	2	3
123	 What about all the dreams you had that didn't come true?	10	2	3
124	 Hmm?	10	2	3
125	 ( Clears throat )	10	2	3
126	 Right.	10	2	3
127	 This link is made of Valyrian steel.	10	2	3
128	 Only one Maester in 100 wears it on his chain.	10	2	3
129	 It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries.	10	2	3
130	 And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells.	10	2	3
131	 I was no different.	11	2	3
132	 I was young.	11	2	3
133	 And what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers	11	2	3
134	 to lift him out of his dull life into a special one?	11	2	3
135	 But in the end, for all my efforts,	11	2	3
136	 I got no more out of it than 1,000 boys before me.	11	2	3
137	 ( Chuckles ) Come on.	11	2	3
138	 All right.	11	2	3
139	 Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world.	11	2	3
140	 But not anymore.	11	2	3
141	 The Dragons are gone.	11	2	3
142	 The Giants are dead.	11	2	3
143	 And the Children of the Forest forgotten.	11	2	3
144	 ( Men shouting, cheering )	12	2	3
145	 ( Grunting )	12	2	3
146	 Loras! Highgarden!	12	2	3
147	 - ( Grunts ) - Get him!	13	2	3
148	 ( Gasps )	13	2	3
149	 ( Grunts )	13	2	3
150	  Oh!	13	2	3
151	 Yield! I yield.	13	2	3
152	 Well fought. Approach.	13	2	3
153	 Rise. Remove your helm.	13	2	3
154	 ( Crowd murmuring )	13	2	3
155	 You are all your father promised and more, My Lady.	13	2	3
156	 I've seen Ser Loras bested once or twice,	13	2	3
157	 but never quite in that fashion.	13	2	3
158	 Now, now, my love. My brother fought valiantly for you.	14	2	3
159	 That he did, my Queen.	14	2	3
160	 But there can only be one champion.	14	2	3
161	 Brienne of Tarth,	14	2	3
162	 you may ask anything of me you desire.	14	2	3
163	 If it is within my power, it is yours.	14	2	3
164	 Your Grace,	14	2	3
165	 I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard.	14	2	3
166	 - ( Crowd murmuring ) - What?	14	2	3
167	 I will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours,	14	2	3
168	 and keep you safe from all harm.	14	2	3
169	 Done.	14	2	3
170	 Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard.	14	2	3
171	 Your Grace, I have the honor to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark,	14	2	3
172	 sent as an envoy by her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell.	15	2	3
173	 Lord of Winterfell and King in the North.	15	2	3
174	 Lady Catelyn. I'm pleased to see you.	15	2	3
175	 May I present my wife Margaery of House Tyrell?	15	2	3
176	 You are very welcome here, Lady Stark.	15	2	3
177	 I'm so sorry for your loss.	15	2	3
178	 You are most kind.	15	2	3
179	 My Lady,	15	2	3
180	 I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer	15	2	3
181	 for your husband's murder.	15	2	3
182	 When I take King's Landing,	15	2	3
183	 I'll bring you Joffrey's head.	15	2	3
184	 ( Cheering )	15	2	3
185	 It will be enough to know that justice was done, My Lord.	15	2	3
186	  Your Grace.	15	2	3
187	 And you should kneel when you approach the King.	15	2	3
188	 There's no need for that. Lady Stark is an honored guest.	15	2	3
189	 Has your son marched against Tywin Lannister yet?	16	2	3
190	 I do not sit on my son's war councils.	16	2	3
191	 And if I did, I would not share his strategies with you.	16	2	3
192	 If Robb Stark wants a pact with us, he should come himself,	16	2	3
193	 not hide behind his mother's skirts.	16	2	3
194	 My son is fighting a war,	16	2	3
195	 not playing at one.	16	2	3
196	 ( Men grumbling )	16	2	3
197	 ( Chuckles )	16	2	3
198	 Don't worry, My Lady.	16	2	3
199	 Our war is just beginning.	16	2	3
200	 ( Men shouting )	16	2	3
201	 - Your Grace. - Gerard.	17	2	3
202	 - How's your foot? - Better, Your Grace.	17	2	3
203	 They don't know their own size is all.	17	2	3
204	 Good man.	17	2	3
205	 I have 100,000 men at my command.	17	2	3
206	 All the might of the Stormlands and the Reach.	17	2	3
207	 And all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers?	17	2	3
208	 It's a game to you, isn't it?	17	2	3
209	 - I pity them. - Why?	17	2	3
210	 Because it won't last.	17	2	3
211	 Because they are the Knights of summer and winter is coming.	17	2	3
212	 Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent.	17	2	3
213	 - She's tired from her journey. - At once, Your Grace.	17	2	3
214	 - Shall I return after? - That won't be necessary.	17	2	3
215	 I would pray awhile. Alone.	17	2	3
216	 If you'll follow me, My Lady.	17	2	3
217	 You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne.	17	2	3
218	 I fought for my King.	18	2	3
219	 Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield.	18	2	3
220	 Die for him if I must.	18	2	3
221	 And, if it please you, Brienne's enough.	18	2	3
222	 I'm no lady.	18	2	3
223	 What are you doing here?	18	2	3
224	 I live here.	18	2	3
225	 - Are you angry with me, brother? - You lying bitch.	18	2	3
226	 It's not my fault you didn't recognize me.	19	2	3
227	 Recognize you? How could I?	19	2	3
228	 The last time I saw you...	19	2	3
229	 You looked like a fat little boy.	19	2	3
230	 You were a fat little boy, too,	19	2	3
231	 but I recognized you.	19	2	3
232	 Why didn't you tell me?	19	2	3
233	 I wanted to see who you were first.	19	2	3
234	 ( Laughs ) And I did.	19	2	3
235	 The plans are made. It's time you heard them.	19	2	3
236	 - Father. - Father.	19	2	3
237	 The wolf pup has gone south	19	2	3
238	 with the entirety of the northern army at his back.	19	2	3
239	 While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands,	19	2	3
240	 the north is ripe for the taking.	19	2	3
241	 The Ironborn will reave and pillage as it was in the old days	19	2	3
242	 all along the northern coast.	19	2	3
243	 We'll spread our dominion across the green lands,	19	2	3
244	 securing the Neck and everything above.	20	2	3
245	 Every stronghold will yield to us one by one.	20	2	3
246	 Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it?	20	2	3
247	 The rest shall be ours--	20	2	3
248	 forest, field and hall.	20	2	3
249	 Yara, my daughter, you'll take 30 longships	20	2	3
250	 to attack Deepwood Motte.	20	2	3
251	 I've always wanted a castle.	20	2	3
252	 And what's my role in all this?	20	2	3
253	 You'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.	20	2	3
254	 A ship?	20	2	3
255	 You give her 30 and I get one?	20	2	3
256	 The sea bitch. We thought she'd be perfect for you.	20	2	3
257	 I'm to fight fishermen?	20	2	3
258	 Be careful of their nets.	20	2	3
259	 Father, I fought with Robb Stark. I know his men.	20	2	3
260	 He won't give up the North so easily.	21	2	3
261	 They won't even know we're there until it's too late.	21	2	3
262	 What do you know of it, woman?	21	2	3
263	 I'm a proven warrior.	21	2	3
264	 Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead	21	2	3
265	 at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect.	21	2	3
266	 I'm not protecting anyone.	21	2	3
267	 I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait.	21	2	3
268	 Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies?	21	2	3
269	 Rise up against them and they could destroy us.	21	2	3
270	 But if we pledge fealty to them,	21	2	3
271	 they'll give us Casterly Rock.	21	2	3
272	 What are our words?	21	2	3
273	 Our words?	21	2	3
274	" - ""We do not sow."" - ""We do not sow."""	21	2	3
275	 We are Ironborn.	21	2	3
276	 We're not subjects. We're not slaves.	21	2	3
277	 We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine.	21	2	3
278	 We take what is ours.	21	2	3
279	 Your time with the wolves has made you weak.	22	2	3
280	 You act as if I volunteered to go.	22	2	3
281	 You gave me away, if you remember.	22	2	3
282	 The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon.	22	2	3
283	 After he crushed you.	22	2	3
284	 Did you take what was yours then?	22	2	3
285	 You gave me away!	22	2	3
286	 Your boy!	22	2	3
287	 Your last boy!	22	2	3
288	 You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore.	22	2	3
289	 And now you curse me because I've come home.	22	2	3
290	 You'd have our father bow down to your other family?	22	2	3
291	 I have no other family.	23	2	3
292	 Don't you?	23	2	3
293	 Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly.	23	2	3
294	 Our ships sail with or without you.	23	2	3
295	 You won't let me leave this room.	23	2	3
296	 - You won't let me-- - Shh, shh, keep your voice down.	23	2	3
297	 Why? You think your father can hear me?	23	2	3
298	 He's 300 miles away!	23	2	3
299	 ( Sighs )	23	2	3
300	 I don't intend for you to stay here.	23	2	3
301	 I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.	23	2	3
302	 Again, only temporary.	23	2	3
303	 Every man who has tasted my cooking	23	2	3
304	 has told me what a good whore I am.	23	2	3
305	 But you wouldn't be a cook.	24	2	3
306	 You'd pose as a scullion.	24	2	3
307	 Scullion? What is a scullion?	24	2	3
308	 Kitchen wench.	24	2	3
309	 - A kitchen wench? - Yes, but--	24	2	3
310	 Cleaning pots?	24	2	3
311	 Is that how my lion wants to see me?	24	2	3
312	 Your lion wants to see you alive.	24	2	3
313	 We've come to a dangerous place.	24	2	3
314	 My sister wants to hurt me.	24	2	3
315	 She'll look for any weakness she can find.	24	2	3
316	 She can't know about you.	24	2	3
317	 I'm the weakness?	24	2	3
318	 It's a compliment, My Lady.	24	2	3
319	 How is being a weakness a compliment?	24	2	3
320	 Language can be a bit tricky here.	24	2	3
321	 Oh, I'm too stupid to understand.	24	2	3
322	 The stupid foreign girl.	24	2	3
323	 I am not a kitchen wench.	24	2	3
324	 When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?	25	2	3
325	 Soon, darling, when the war is over.	25	2	3
326	 Mother says I'll have a new gown for the ceremony	25	2	3
327	 and another for the feast.	25	2	3
328	 But yours will be ivory since you're the bride.	25	2	3
329	 The Princess just spoke to you.	25	2	3
330	 Pardon, Your Grace.	25	2	3
331	 I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella.	25	2	3
332	 I'm counting the days until the fighting is done	25	2	3
333	 and I can pledge my love to the King in sight of the Gods.	26	2	3
334	 Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?	26	2	3
335	 He might.	26	2	3
336	 Would you like that?	26	2	3
337	 No. I don't think so.	26	2	3
338	 Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty.	26	2	3
339	 Won't you, little dove?	26	2	3
340	 - ( Knocking ) - ( Gasps ) Come in.	26	2	3
341	 ( Door opens )	27	2	3
342	 Who are you?	27	2	3
343	 I'm Shae, My Lady. Your new handmaiden.	27	2	3
344	 I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden.	27	2	3
345	 - You're not from here. - No.	27	2	3
346	 What are you doing?	27	2	3
347	 Waiting for you to tell me what to do.	27	2	3
348	 I shouldn't have to tell you to do things.	27	2	3
349	 You should just do them.	27	2	3
350	 What things?	27	2	3
351	 Change my linens, wash my clothing,	27	2	3
352	 scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair.	27	2	3
353	 - No. - You said to brush--	27	2	3
354	 Not now.	27	2	3
355	 Your chamber pot is empty.	28	2	3
356	 Clean the table.	28	2	3
357	 Have you ever been a handmaiden before?	28	2	3
358	 - Yes. - For whom?	28	2	3
359	 - Lady Zuriff. - Lady Zuriff?	28	2	3
360	 Lady Zuriff.	28	2	3
361	 There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.	28	2	3
362	 She wasn't in this city.	28	2	3
363	 Well, I don't know how they did things in that city,	28	2	3
364	 but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies,	28	2	3
365	 not the other way around.	28	2	3
366	 And I don't have time to answer 1,000 questions	28	2	3
367	 and teach you how to do your job.	28	2	3
368	 Do you want me to leave?	28	2	3
369	 Just brush my hair.	29	2	3
370	 Oh, thank the Gods.	29	2	3
371	 I haven't had a proper shit in six days.	29	2	3
372	 I've encountered this problem before, My Lord.	29	2	3
373	 The stresses of power often have this	29	2	3
374	 insalubrious effect.	29	2	3
375	 Two drops with water daily.	29	2	3
376	 Right. I'm so grateful to have a man	29	2	3
377	 of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.	29	2	3
378	 - Please. - Thank you, My Lord.	29	2	3
379	 I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?	29	2	3
380	 Why, yes, of course, My Lord.	29	2	3
381	 These are perilous times.	29	2	3
382	 And the crown must forge new alliances.	29	2	3
383	 And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.	30	2	3
384	 Matrimony, huh?	30	2	3
385	 Yes.	30	2	3
386	 I'm trusting the council with these plans,	30	2	3
387	 but the queen mustn't know.	30	2	3
388	 We can't have her meddling in affairs	30	2	3
389	 that could determine the future of the realm.	30	2	3
390	 There's too much at stake.	30	2	3
391	 Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes.	30	2	3
392	 I shall be silent as the grave.	30	2	3
393	 I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne.	30	2	3
394	 Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son	30	2	3
395	 when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty	30	2	3
396	 and their army should we need it.	30	2	3
397	 Myrcella sent away to Dorne?	30	2	3
398	 But remember, the queen mustn't know.	30	2	3
399	" Ooh, ""the queen mustn't know."""	30	2	3
400	 I love conversations that begin this way.	30	2	3
401	 I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off	31	2	3
402	 to Theon Greyjoy.	31	2	3
403	 Theon Greyjoy?	31	2	3
404	 Forgive me, My Lord,?	31	2	3
405	 He grew up a ward of Winterfell.	31	2	3
406	 He fights for Robb Stark.	31	2	3
407	 Precisely. Theon's father loathes the Starks	31	2	3
408	 and will convince the boy to come to our side.	31	2	3
409	 Greyjoy can destroy the northern army from within	31	2	3
410	 and we can have his father's ships.	31	2	3
411	 But remember, you must tell no one.	31	2	3
412	 Tell no one what?	31	2	3
413	 I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale.	31	2	3
414	 Lysa is not fond of me.	31	2	3
415	 But perhaps the promise of a royal match	31	2	3
416	 will convince her to let bygones be bygones.	31	2	3
417	 She imprisoned you.	31	2	3
418	 She tried to execute you.	31	2	3
419	 And you offer her son a princess?	32	2	3
420	 For men in our position, holding grudges can be	32	2	3
421	 an encumbrance, don't you think?	32	2	3
422	 And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?	32	2	3
423	 Who better?	32	2	3
424	 Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa,	32	2	3
425	 if I cared to.	32	2	3
426	 What's in it for me?	32	2	3
427	 The gratitude of the people of Westeros	32	2	3
428	 for helping to end this war,	32	2	3
429	 the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold...	32	2	3
430	 and Harrenhal.	32	2	3
431	 Harrenhal is cursed.	32	2	3
432	 Never took you for a superstitious man.	32	2	3
433	 By all means, tear it down and rebuild.	32	2	3
434	 You'll be able to afford it.	32	2	3
435	 I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands.	32	2	3
436	 With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the	33	2	3
437	 greatest lords in the realm.	33	2	3
438	 You served my family well in the matter of the succession.	33	2	3
439	 So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too.	33	2	3
440	 Until you snatched it away.	33	2	3
441	 I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn.	33	2	3
442	 I didn't need Janos Slynt.	33	2	3
443	 It's settled, then?	33	2	3
444	 Good.	33	2	3
445	 Oh, and remember--	33	2	3
446	 the queen mustn't know.	33	2	3
447	 ( Breathing heavily )	33	2	3
448	 That must hurt.	34	2	3
449	 ( Groans )	34	2	3
450	 What?	34	2	3
451	 What is it?	34	2	3
452	 ( Scoffs )	34	2	3
453	 A member of the Kingsguard?	34	2	3
454	 As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.	34	2	3
455	 ( Sighs )	34	2	3
456	 Brienne is a very capable warrior.	34	2	3
457	 And she's devoted to me.	34	2	3
458	 You're jealous.	35	2	3
459	 Jealous?	35	2	3
460	 Of Brienne the beauty?	35	2	3
461	 Don't make me laugh.	35	2	3
462	 - I'll make it up to you. - No, Your Grace.	35	2	3
463	 Not tonight.	35	2	3
464	 There's another Tyrell who requires your attention.	35	2	3
465	 You didn't win my father's support	35	2	3
466	 or his army on charm alone.	35	2	3
467	 Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back.	35	2	3
468	 Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.	35	2	3
469	 And Margaery's a virgin?	35	2	3
470	 Officially.	35	2	3
471	 Shall I bring her to you?	35	2	3
472	 I should warn you,	36	2	3
473	 I've had quite a bit of wine.	36	2	3
474	 As is your right. You are a King.	36	2	3
475	 You look very beautiful.	36	2	3
476	 Thank you, Your Grace.	36	2	3
477	 - It's a lovely gown. - You think so?	36	2	3
478	 I can't decide how I like it better.	36	2	3
479	 This way...	36	2	3
480	 or this way.	36	2	3
481	 You certainly don't need it.	37	2	3
482	 Although...	37	2	3
483	 some say that beauty most desired	37	2	3
484	 is the beauty concealed.	37	2	3
485	 Must be the wine.	37	2	3
486	 Here, let me.	37	2	3
487	 ( Shudders )	37	2	3
488	 I'm sorry.	38	2	3
489	 Do you want my brother to come in and help?	38	2	3
490	 - What? - He could get you started.	38	2	3
491	 I know he wouldn't mind.	38	2	3
492	 Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.	38	2	3
493	 I don't know what you're talking about.	38	2	3
494	 There's no need for us to play games.	38	2	3
495	 Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them.	38	2	3
496	 Your enemies aren't happy about us.	38	2	3
497	 They want to tear us apart.	39	2	3
498	 And the best way to stop them	39	2	3
499	 is to put your baby	39	2	3
500	 in my belly.	39	2	3
501	 We can try again later.	39	2	3
502	 You decide how you want to do it--	39	2	3
503	 with me, with me and Loras.	39	2	3
504	 However else you like.	39	2	3
505	 Whatever you need to do.	39	2	3
506	 You are a King.	39	2	3
507	  You monster.	39	2	3
508	 Myrcella is my only daughter.	39	2	3
509	 Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?	39	2	3
510	 Myrcella's a Princess.	39	2	3
511	 Some would say she was born for this.	39	2	3
512	 I will not let you ship her off to Dorne	40	2	3
513	 as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.	40	2	3
514	 Dorne is the safest place or her.	40	2	3
515	 Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.	40	2	3
516	 That's why we need to seduce them.	40	2	3
517	 We're going to need their support in the war	40	2	3
518	 your son started.	40	2	3
519	 - She'll be a hostage. - A guest.	40	2	3
520	 You won't get away with this.	40	2	3
521	 You think the piece of paper father gave you keeps you safe.	40	2	3
522	 Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too.	40	2	3
523	 - It's done, Cersei. - No.	40	2	3
524	 - You cannot stop it. - No!	40	2	3
525	 Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls?	40	2	3
526	 Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children?	40	2	3
527	 Make no mistake.	40	2	3
528	 They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours.	40	2	3
529	 Get out! Get out!	41	2	3
530	 Theon of the House Greyjoy,	42	2	3
531	 you would this day consecrate your faith to the drowned God?	42	2	3
532	 - I would. - Kneel.	42	2	3
533	 Let Theon, your servant,	42	2	3
534	 be born again from the sea as you were.	42	2	3
535	 Bless him with salt.	42	2	3
536	 Bless him with stone.	42	2	3
537	 Bless him with steel.	42	2	3
538	 What is dead may never die.	42	2	3
539	 What is dead may never die...	43	2	3
540	 But rises again harder and stronger.	43	2	3
541	 Stand.	43	2	3
542	 ( Dog barking )	43	2	3
543	 ( Footsteps approaching )	43	2	3
544	 I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf.	43	2	3
545	 If Myrcella marries the Martell boy,	43	2	3
546	 she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she?	43	2	3
547	 No, afraid not. Sorry about that.	43	2	3
548	 And Harrenhal--	43	2	3
549	 I suppose that's off the table as well.	44	2	3
550	 Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too.	44	2	3
551	 Leave me out of your next deception.	44	2	3
552	 Oh, that's a shame.	44	2	3
553	 You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception.	44	2	3
554	 My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade.	44	2	3
555	 I would see him released.	44	2	3
556	 That's where you come in.	44	2	3
557	 Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.	44	2	3
558	 No, he won't. But his mother might.	44	2	3
559	 How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?	44	2	3
560	 ( Footsteps approaching )	44	2	3
561	 - Find him? - Oh, aye.	44	2	3
562	 And he has company.	44	2	3
563	 Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt.	44	2	3
564	 - No, you don't. - No, I don't.	44	2	3
565	 - ( Door bursts ) - ( Gasps )	44	2	3
566	 What is the meaning of this?	44	2	3
567	 No, please, please.	45	2	3
568	 You disappoint me, Grand Maester.	45	2	3
569	 I am your loyal servant.	45	2	3
570	 So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans	45	2	3
571	 to send Myrcella to Dorne.	45	2	3
572	 No! Never!	45	2	3
573	 It's a falsehood. I swear it.	45	2	3
574	 It wasn't me.	45	2	3
575	 Ah, Varys.	45	2	3
576	 It was Varys the spider.	45	2	3
577	 See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys.	45	2	3
578	 I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn.	45	2	3
579	 I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish.	45	2	3
580	 No one but you.	45	2	3
581	 The eunuch has spies everywhere.	45	2	3
582	 Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.	45	2	3
583	 - No, no, no. - There are no goats, halfman.	45	2	3
584	 Well, make do.	45	2	3
585	 ( Whimpering )	45	2	3
586	 How long have you been spying for my sister?	45	2	3
587	 All I did, I did for House Lannister.	46	2	3
588	 Always. Your lord father, ask him.	46	2	3
589	 I've always been his servant	46	2	3
590	 since the days of the Mad King.	46	2	3
591	 - I don't like his beard. - What?	46	2	3
592	 What? Oh, no. No.	46	2	3
593	 ( Whimpering )	46	2	3
594	 How many hands have you betrayed, Pycelle?	46	2	3
595	 Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?	46	2	3
596	 Lord Arryn, he knew.	46	2	3
597	 ( Stammering ) He knew the truth about the queen.	46	2	3
598	 And, well, he planned to act,	46	2	3
599	 to tell King Robert.	46	2	3
600	 So you poisoned him?	46	2	3
601	 No. Never.	46	2	3
602	 But you let him die, made sure he succumbed.	46	2	3
603	 Lannister-- I always served Lannister.	46	2	3
604	 Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.	46	2	3
605	 Oh, no. No, no, no. No, please.	46	2	3
606	 Don't! You can't do this to me!	46	2	3
607	 For your trouble.	46	2	3
608	 ( Pycelle shouting )	47	2	3
609	 You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend	47	2	3
610	 is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.	47	2	3
611	 Good. One of my better ideas.	47	2	3
612	 And it seems the Grand Maester	47	2	3
613	 has found his way into a black cell.	47	2	3
614	 Well played, My Lord Hand.	47	2	3
615	 But should I be worried?	47	2	3
616	 Janos Slynt, Pycelle--	47	2	3
617	 the small council grows smaller every day.	47	2	3
618	 The council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly.	47	2	3
619	 I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.	48	2	3
620	 Power is a curious thing, My Lord.	48	2	3
621	 Are you fond of riddles?	48	2	3
622	 Why, am I about to hear one?	48	2	3
623	 Three great men sit in a room.	48	2	3
624	 A king, a priest and a rich man.	48	2	3
625	 Between them stands a common Sellsword.	48	2	3
626	 Each great man bids the Sellsword kill the other two.	48	2	3
627	 Who lives, who dies?	48	2	3
628	 Depends on the Sellsword.	48	2	3
629	 Does it? He has neither crown	48	2	3
630	 nor gold nor favor with the Gods.	48	2	3
631	 He has a sword, the power of life and death.	48	2	3
632	 But if it's swordsmen who rule,	48	2	3
633	 why do we pretend Kings hold all the power?	48	2	3
634	 When Ned Stark lost his head,	48	2	3
635	 who was truly responsible?	48	2	3
636	 Joffrey? The executioner?	48	2	3
637	 Or something else?	48	2	3
638	 I've decided I don't like riddles.	48	2	3
639	 Power resides where men believe it resides.	49	2	3
640	 It's a trick,	49	2	3
641	 a shadow on the wall.	49	2	3
642	 And a very small man	49	2	3
643	 can cast a very large shadow.	49	2	3
644	 ( Crickets chirping )	49	2	3
645	 ( Horse whinnies )	49	2	3
646	 ( Snoring )	49	2	3
647	 ( Door opens )	49	2	3
648	 You should be sleeping.	50	2	3
649	 Tomorrow's a long march.	50	2	3
650	 30 miles if it don't piss on us.	50	2	3
651	 I can't sleep.	50	2	3
652	 I don't like the taste.	50	2	3
653	 ( Chuckles )	50	2	3
654	 Well...	50	2	3
655	 You don't drink it for the flavor, to be honest.	50	2	3
656	 What?	50	2	3
657	 How do you sleep?	50	2	3
658	 Same as most men, I think.	50	2	3
659	 But you've seen things,	50	2	3
660	 horrible things.	50	2	3
661	 Aye.	51	2	3
662	 I've seen some pretty things, too,	51	2	3
663	 but not nearly so many.	51	2	3
664	 How do you sleep when you--	51	2	3
665	 when you have those things in your head?	51	2	3
666	 You didn't see that.	51	2	3
667	 I made damn sure.	51	2	3
668	 I close my eyes and I see them up there.	51	2	3
669	 All of them	51	2	3
670	 standing there--	51	2	3
671	 Joffrey,	51	2	3
672	 the Queen,	51	2	3
673	 and--	51	2	3
674	 and my sister.	51	2	3
675	 You know, we've got something in common, me and you.	52	2	3
676	 You know that?	52	2	3
677	 I must have been	52	2	3
678	 a couple of years older than you.	52	2	3
679	 I saw my brother stabbed through the heart	52	2	3
680	 right on our doorstep.	52	2	3
681	 He weren't much of a villain what skewered him.	52	2	3
682	 Willem, the lad's name was.	52	2	3
683	 He ran off before anyone could spit.	52	2	3
684	 And I just stood there,	52	2	3
685	 watching my brother die.	52	2	3
686	 But here's the funny part.	52	2	3
687	 I can't picture my brother's face anymore.	52	2	3
688	 But Willem--	52	2	3
689	 oh, he was a nice-looking boy.	52	2	3
690	 He had good white teeth,	52	2	3
691	 blue eyes,	52	2	3
692	 one of those dimpled chins all the girls like.	53	2	3
693	 I would think about him when I was working,	53	2	3
694	 when I was drinking, when I was having a shit.	53	2	3
695	 It got to the point	53	2	3
696	 where I would say his name every night before I went to bed.	53	2	3
697	 Willem. Willem.	53	2	3
698	 Willem.	53	2	3
699	 A prayer almost.	53	2	3
700	 Well, one day...	53	2	3
701	 Willem came riding back into town.	53	2	3
702	 I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull,	53	2	3
703	 they had to bury him with it.	53	2	3
704	 Willem's horse got me to the Wall	53	2	3
705	 and I've been wearing black ever since.	53	2	3
706	 Well...	54	2	3
707	 that'll help you sleep, eh?	54	2	3
708	 ( Horn sounds )	54	2	3
709	 ( Men shouting )	54	2	3
710	 Ho!	54	2	3
711	 Get up, you lazy sons of whores!	54	2	3
712	 Arm yourselves.	54	2	3
713	 -  Get up. -  Get up.	54	2	3
714	 Keep out of sight, both of you.	54	2	3
715	 - No, I'm not afraid. - I can fight.	54	2	3
716	 Keep out of sight.	54	2	3
717	 If things go wrong, you run.	54	2	3
718	 Do you hear me?	54	2	3
719	 You run along North and don't look back.	54	2	3
720	 Hey, there's men out there	54	2	3
721	 who want to fuck your corpses.	54	2	3
722	 Outside, now!	54	2	3
723	  Come on, move, move!	54	2	3
724	 ( Horse whinnies )	54	2	3
725	 Gold Cloaks!	54	2	3
726	 ( Shouting )	55	2	3
727	 Everyone out!	55	2	3
728	 ( Shouting )	55	2	3
729	 Hey, you! Open the damn cage!	55	2	3
730	 Where's the bastard, Crow?	55	2	3
731	 Got more than a few bastards here. Who's asking?	55	2	3
732	 Ser Amory Lorch, sworn Bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister.	55	2	3
733	 These men from the capital requested our assistance.	55	2	3
734	 Drop your weapons in the name of the King.	55	2	3
735	 Now, which King would that be?	55	2	3
736	 This is your last chance.	55	2	3
737	 In the name of King Joffrey,	55	2	3
738	 drop your weapons.	55	2	3
739	 ( Spits ) I don't think I will.	55	2	3
740	 So be it.	55	2	3
741	 ( Grunts )	55	2	3
742	 I always hated crossbows. Take too long to load.	55	2	3
743	 ( Groans )	56	2	3
744	 ( Gurgles )	56	2	3
745	  Boy, come here. Boy!	56	2	3
746	 - Sweet boy, help us. - Come back here!	56	2	3
747	 Help us, boy!	56	2	3
748	 ( Shouting )	56	2	3
749	 A man can fight! Free us!	56	2	3
750	 Quick, give it to me.	57	2	3
751	 Give me the ax. Give me that.	57	2	3
752	  Put 'em on the wagon!	57	2	3
753	 There's more here. Come on.	57	2	3
754	 ( Grunts )	57	2	3
755	 ( Chuckles )	57	2	3
756	 What do we have here?	57	2	3
757	 No!	57	2	3
758	 That's a fine little blade.	57	2	3
759	 Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.	57	2	3
760	 I yield! I yield!	57	2	3
761	  Round up any survivors.	57	2	3
762	 We'll take them back to Harrenhal.	57	2	3
763	 You heard him. You're coming with us.	57	2	3
764	 I yield!	57	2	3
765	 ( Whimpering )	58	2	3
766	 Help!	58	2	3
767	 Help me!	58	2	3
768	 Something wrong with your leg, boy?	58	2	3
769	 Look at it.	58	2	3
770	 Can you walk?	58	2	3
771	 No. You got to carry me.	58	2	3
772	 All right.	58	2	3
773	 ( Coughing )	58	2	3
774	 Carry him, he says. ( Laughs )	58	2	3
775	 We're looking for a bastard named Gendry.	59	2	3
776	 Give him up	59	2	3
777	 or I'll start taking eyeballs.	59	2	3
778	 You want Gendry?	59	2	3
779	 You already got him.	59	2	3
780	 He loved that helmet.	59	2	3

10	 Don't tell him that.	0	2	9
11	 Does it give you joy to scare people?	0	2	9

25	 My dear nephew, you do understand Stannis	1	2	9
26	 Baratheon sails this way?	1	2	9
27	 They say Stannis never smiles. I'll give him a red smile.	1	2	9
28	 If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day.	1	2	9
29	 Will it hold?	1	2	9
30	 Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace.	1	2	9
31	 Stannis knows King's Landing.	1	2	9
32	 He knows where the walls are strongest	1	2	9
33	 and he knows which gates are weakest.	1	2	9
34	 Mud gate. That's where he'll land.	1	2	9
35	 And if Stannis does attack the mud gate, what do we have?	1	2	9
36	 ( Theme music playing )	1	2	9
37		1	2	9

40	 That's it.	4	2	9
41	 The tide's against us.	5	2	9
42	 Aye, but we have the wind.	5	2	9
43	 She'll blow us straight to the gate.	5	2	9
44	 You're coming home.	5	2	9
45	 King's Landing hasn't been home for 20 years.	5	2	9
46	 I spent most of my life dodging the Royal Fleet.	5	2	9
47	 And now I'm sailing right at them.	5	2	9
48	 This is the Royal Fleet.	5	2	9
49	 And you're not a smuggler anymore, you're the high captain.	5	2	9
50	 Of course there are several Royal Fleets at the moment.	5	2	9
51	 Not after tonight. When the sun rises,	5	2	9
52	 Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne	5	2	9
53	 and you will be his Hand.	5	2	9
54	 - Gods be good. - God.	6	2	9
55	 Father, there is only one and he watches over us.	6	2	9
56	 - But not over them? - Over all of us.	6	2	9
57	 The people of King's Landing did not choose the false King	6	2	9
58	 Joffrey Baratheon.	6	2	9
59	 They will be glad to see his head on a spike.	6	2	9
60	 Well, first we have to put it there.	6	2	9
61	 Our ships outnumber theirs 10 to one.	6	2	9
62	 Our army outnumber theirs five to one.	6	2	9
63	 Those walls have never been breached.	6	2	9
64	 And the men guarding the walls,	6	2	9
65	 when they see you, they don't see a liberator.	6	2	9
66	 They see a stranger come to set their city on fire.	6	2	9
67	 I have faith in the Lord of Light.	6	2	9
68	 I have faith in our cause.	6	2	9
69	 And I have faith in my captain.	6	2	9
70	 Are you afraid, my lion?	7	2	9
71	 If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find.	7	2	9
72	 Of course I'm afraid.	7	2	9
73	 I won't let them hurt you.	7	2	9
74	 I'm a Lannister.	7	2	9
75	 I don't have a choice in all this.	7	2	9
76	 But it's not your war.	7	2	9
77	 It is now.	8	2	9
78	 You can't fuck your way out of everything.	8	2	9
79	 I have so far.	8	2	9
80	 Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent?	8	2	9
81	 That I should make love to you like it was your	8	2	9
82	 last day on this earth.	8	2	9
83	 As you know, Your Grace,	8	2	9
84	 it is not only the sworn duty of a Maester	8	2	9
85	 to carry out the wishes of the house he serves,	8	2	9
86	 but also to offer guidance	8	2	9
87	 and counsel in times of war.	8	2	9
88	 Your words are always wise and measured.	8	2	9
89	 - If you could-- - If anything,	8	2	9
90	 a Maester's duties become more urgent	9	2	9
91	 in times of war and turmoil.	9	2	9
92	 I remember back in the days of king--	9	2	9
93	 You brought me something?	9	2	9
94	 Yes.	9	2	9
95	 Essence of Nightshade	9	2	9
96	 is as dangerous as it is efficacious.	9	2	9
97	 A single drop in a cup of wine	9	2	9
98	 suffices to soothe ragged nerves.	9	2	9
99	 Three drops will bring on a deep	9	2	9
100	 and dreamless sleep.	9	2	9
101	 10 drops, however--	9	2	9
102	 I know what 10 drops will bring.	9	2	9
103	 - Your Grace, if I may ask-- - You may not.	9	2	9
104	 You must have a lot of work to do.	9	2	9
105	 I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.	9	2	9
106	 Yes. A siege is very--	10	2	9
107	 Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester. There are so many.	10	2	9
108	 Your Grace.	10	2	9
109	  and so he spoke 	10	2	9
110	  that Lord of Castamere 	10	2	9
111	  but now the rains 	10	2	9
112	  weep o'er his halls 	10	2	9
113	  with no one there to hear 	10	2	9
114	  yes, now the rains 	10	2	9
115	  weep o'er his halls 	10	2	9
116	  and not a soul to hear. 	10	2	9
117	 - To the boys! - Lannisters!	10	2	9
118	 Where'd you learn the Lannister song?	10	2	9
119	 Drunk Lannisters.	10	2	9
120	 You've got a pretty voice.	10	2	9
121	 Thank you very much.	10	2	9
122	 And I like your nose.	11	2	9
123	 How many times you break it?	11	2	9
124	 Well, now let's see.	11	2	9
125	 First time I was five.	11	2	9
126	 Me mom smacked me with an iron poker.	11	2	9
127	 Ooh.	11	2	9
128	 Oh, it wasn't me she was aiming at.	11	2	9
129	 She was trying for me little brother.	11	2	9
130	 Now he was a real pest.	11	2	9
131	 Second time I was nine.	11	2	9
132	 Got in a scrap with a few older boys.	11	2	9
133	 They won.	11	2	9
134	 Third time...	11	2	9
135	 Eh, you don't want to know about the third time.	11	2	9
136	 Poor nose.	11	2	9
137	 Don't feel sorry for him.	11	2	9
138	 He'll be halfway up your ass before the night's through.	11	2	9
139	 Welcome, friends.	12	2	9
140	 This round's on me.	12	2	9
141	 I don't think he likes me.	12	2	9
142	 You think you're a hard man?	12	2	9
143	 I know it.	12	2	9
144	 It's warm in here.	12	2	9
145	 We've got beautiful women	12	2	9
146	 and good brown ale.	12	2	9
147	 Plenty for everyone.	13	2	9
148	 And all you want	13	2	9
149	 is to put one of us in the cold ground	13	2	9
150	 with no women to keep us company.	13	2	9
151	 Oh, there's women in the ground.	13	2	9
152	 I put some there myself.	13	2	9
153	 So have you.	13	2	9
154	 You like fucking and drinking	13	2	9
155	 and singing.	13	2	9
156	 But killing--	13	2	9
157	 killing's the thing you love.	13	2	9
158	 You're just like me.	13	2	9
159	 Only smaller.	13	2	9
160	 And quicker.	13	2	9
161	 Eh?	13	2	9
162	 Your Lord Imp is gonna miss you.	13	2	9
163	 Aye.	14	2	9
164	 I expect he will someday.	14	2	9
165	 Here we are.	14	2	9
166	 One more drink before the war?	14	2	9
167	 Shall we?	14	2	9
168	 I've always hated the bells.	14	2	9
169	 They ring for horror--	14	2	9
170	 a dead king, a city under siege.	14	2	9
171	 - A wedding. - Exactly.	14	2	9
172	 Podrick, is that it?	14	2	9
173	" ""Is that it?"" Nice touch."	14	2	9
174	 As if you don't know the name of every boy in town.	15	2	9
175	 I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.	15	2	9
176	 I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.	15	2	9
177	 Do you trust him?	15	2	9
178	 Oddly enough, I do.	15	2	9
179	 Good.	15	2	9
180	 The map you asked for.	15	2	9
181	 There must be 20 miles of tunnels beneath the city.	15	2	9
182	 Closer to 50.	15	2	9
183	 The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege	15	2	9
184	 and to provide escape if necessary.	15	2	9
185	 I'm not escaping.	15	2	9
186	 Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship.	15	2	9
187	 And if the ship goes down, I go with her.	15	2	9
188	 That is good to hear.	15	2	9
189	 Though I'm sure many captains say the same	15	2	9
190	 while their ship is afloat.	15	2	9
191	 You look well suited for battle, My Lord.	16	2	9
192	 Well, I'm not.	16	2	9
193	 For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong.	16	2	9
194	 My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon	16	2	9
195	 has taken up with a Red Priestess from Asshai.	16	2	9
196	 What of it?	16	2	9
197	 You don't believe in the old powers, My Lord?	16	2	9
198	 Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting-- what do you think?	16	2	9
199	 I think you believe in what you see	16	2	9
200	 and in what those you trust have seen.	16	2	9
201	 You probably don't entirely trust me.	16	2	9
202	 Mm, don't take it personally.	16	2	9
203	 I don't entirely trust myself.	16	2	9
204	 And yet I have seen things	16	2	9
205	 and heard things--	16	2	9
206	 things you have not, things I wish I had not.	16	2	9
207	 I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut.	16	2	9
208	 No, I don't believe you have.	17	2	9
209	 One day I will.	17	2	9
210	 The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies	17	2	9
211	 and paved his path to our door.	17	2	9
212	 For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne,	17	2	9
213	 I can think of nothing worse.	17	2	9
214	 And tonight,	17	2	9
215	 I believe you are the only man who can stop him.	17	2	9
216	 They're welcoming the new king.	18	2	9
217	 I've never known bells to mean surrender.	18	2	9
218	 They want to play music with us? Let's play.	18	2	9
219	 - Drums. - Drums!	18	2	9
220	 Remember, wait till the shit--	18	2	9
221	 The ships are in the bay.	18	2	9
222	 They must be far enough in so they won't be--	18	2	9
223	" I know what ""in"" means."	18	2	9
224	 - Do you know how to use that? - I chopped wood once.	18	2	9
225	 No, I watched my brother chopping wood.	18	2	9
226	 I saw you kill a man with a shield.	18	2	9
227	 You'll be unstoppable with an axe.	18	2	9
228	 - Don't get killed. - Nor you, my friend.	18	2	9
229	 - Oh, are we friends now? - Of course we are.	18	2	9
230	 Just because I pay you for your services doesn't	19	2	9
231	 diminish our friendship.	19	2	9
232	 Enhances it, really.	19	2	9
233	 Oh, enhances. Fancy word for a sellsword.	19	2	9
234	 Been spending time with fancy folks.	19	2	9
235	 Lady Sansa and, uh, Sheila.	19	2	9
236	 Shae.	19	2	9
237	 Shae, yes.	19	2	9
238	 Surely my sister has asked you to join	19	2	9
239	 the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast.	19	2	9
240	 She has, My Lord,	19	2	9
241	 but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off.	19	2	9
242	 Sansa.	19	2	9
243	 He's been a great romantic, my nephew.	19	2	9
244	 Sansa, come here.	19	2	9
245	 I will pray for your safe return, My Lord.	19	2	9
246	 Will you?	19	2	9
247	 Just as I pray for the King's.	19	2	9
248	 Stay safe, My Lady.	20	2	9
249	 And you, my lion.	20	2	9
250	 Your king rides forth to battle.	20	2	9
251	 You should see him off with a kiss.	20	2	9
252	 My new blade.	20	2	9
253	 Hearteater I've named it.	20	2	9
254	 Kiss it.	20	2	9
255	 You'll kiss it again when I return	20	2	9
256	 and taste my Uncle's blood.	20	2	9
257	 Will you slay him yourself?	20	2	9
258	 If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.	20	2	9
259	 So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the Vanguard?	20	2	9
260	 A king doesn't discuss	20	2	9
261	 battle plans with stupid girls.	20	2	9
262	 I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid.	20	2	9
263	 Of course you'll be in the Vanguard.	20	2	9
264	 They say my brother Robb always goes	21	2	9
265	 where the fighting is thickest.	21	2	9
266	 And he is only a pretender.	21	2	9
267	 Your brother's turn will come.	21	2	9
268	 Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too.	21	2	9
269	 Some of those boys will never come back.	21	2	9
270	 Joffrey will.	21	2	9
271	 The worst ones always live.	21	2	9
272	 Shh. Come, My Lady.	21	2	9
273	 - Where's our fleet? - On the way.	22	2	9
274	 Why isn't it here now? They're coming.	22	2	9
275	 Hound, tell the Hand that his King has asked him a question.	22	2	9
276	 The King has asked you a question.	22	2	9
277	 Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king	22	2	9
278	 that the Hand is extremely busy.	22	2	9
279	 The Hand of the King would like me to tell	22	2	9
280	 you to tell the King--	22	2	9
281	 If I tell the Hound to cut you in half,	22	2	9
282	 he'll do it without a second thought.	22	2	9
283	 That would make me the Quarterman.	22	2	9
284	 It just doesn't have the same ring to it.	22	2	9
285	 Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal.	22	2	9
286	 No signal, no plan.	23	2	9
287	 No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city,	23	2	9
288	 takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched	23	2	9
289	 little head atop a gate somewhere.	23	2	9
290	 It might be quite amusing,	23	2	9
291	 except that my head would be up there, too.	23	2	9
292	 I've never much liked my head,	23	2	9
293	 but I don't want to see it removed just yet.	23	2	9
294	 Where are their ships?	23	2	9
295	 It is wise to attack at night. We took them by surprise.	23	2	9
296	 Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago.	23	2	9
297	 There are no surprises here.	23	2	9
298	 If it's true there is dissension in their ranks,	23	2	9
299	 maybe their sailors have mutinied.	23	2	9
300	 Maybe.	23	2	9
301	 I don't know why she wants me here.	23	2	9
302	 She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me.	23	2	9
303	 Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else.	24	2	9
304	 I doubt it.	24	2	9
305	 Maybe she's jealous of you.	24	2	9
306	 Why would she be jealous?	24	2	9
307	 Sansa.	24	2	9
308	 I was wondering where our little dove had flown.	24	2	9
309	 You look pale, child.	24	2	9
310	 Is your red flower still blooming?	24	2	9
311	 Yes.	24	2	9
312	 Fitting, isn't it?	24	2	9
313	 The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here.	24	2	9
314	 Pour Lady Sansa some wine.	24	2	9
315	 I'm not thirsty, Your Grace.	24	2	9
316	 So? I didn't offer you water.	24	2	9
317	 What's he doing here?	24	2	9
318	 Ser Ilyn?	24	2	9
319	 He's here to defend us.	24	2	9
320	 When the axes smash down those doors,	24	2	9
321	 you may be glad to have him.	24	2	9
322	 But we have guards to defend us.	25	2	9
323	 Guards we have paid.	25	2	9
324	 Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones	25	2	9
325	 out of the doors.	25	2	9
326	 The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away	25	2	9
327	 with a stolen horse and some gold cups.	25	2	9
328	 The battle's first traitors.	25	2	9
329	 Have Ser Ilyn see to them.	25	2	9
330	 Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.	25	2	9
331	 The only way to keep the small folk loyal	25	2	9
332	 is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy.	25	2	9
333	 Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.	25	2	9
334	 You said he was here to protect us.	25	2	9
335	 He is.	25	2	9
336	 Traitors are a danger to us all.	25	2	9
337	 More wine.	25	2	9
338	 There they are.	26	2	9
339	 - Archers to their marks. - Archers, to your marks!	26	2	9
340	 Archers!	26	2	9
341	 Nock your arrows!	26	2	9
342	 Nock arrows!	26	2	9
343	 - Hold fast. - Hold fast!	26	2	9
344	 What are you doing? We need to attack them.	26	2	9
345	 - Hold fast. - Boulders ready!	26	2	9
346	 Hold fast!	26	2	9
347	 There's only one ship. Where are the rest of them?	26	2	9
348	 Where are the rest of them?!	26	2	9
349	 There's only one ship.	26	2	9
350	 Archers, stand to!	27	2	9
351	 Man the below!	27	2	9
352	 - Nock! - Nock and set!	27	2	9
353	 Draw!	27	2	9
354	 Hold.	27	2	9
355	 Hold!	27	2	9
356	 There's no one on board.	27	2	9
357	 More rocks coming up!	27	2	9
358	 Hold.	28	2	9
359	 Wildfire.	28	2	9
360	 Steer clear! Steer clear!	28	2	9
361	 Matthos! Get down!	28	2	9
362	 - Prepare to land. - Your Grace...	30	2	9
363	 The dwarf has played his little trick.	30	2	9
364	 - The wildfire-- - He can only play it once.	30	2	9
365	 We're too far from the gates.	30	2	9
366	 The fire, their archers--	30	2	9
367	 hundreds will die.	30	2	9
368	 Thousands.	30	2	9
369	 Come with me and take this city!	30	2	9
370	 Sansa, come here, little dove.	31	2	9
371	 My queen.	31	2	9
372	 What are you doing?	31	2	9
373	 Praying.	31	2	9
374	 You're perfect, aren't you?	31	2	9
375	 Praying.	31	2	9
376	 What are you praying for?	31	2	9
377	 For the Gods to have mercy on us all.	31	2	9
378	 Oh. On all of us?	31	2	9
379	 - Yes, Your Grace. - Even me?	31	2	9
380	 Of course, Your Grace.	31	2	9
381	 Even Joffrey?	31	2	9
382	 - Joffrey is my-- - Oh, shut up, you little fool.	31	2	9
383	 Praying to the Gods to have mercy on us all.	32	2	9
384	 The Gods have no mercy. That's why they're Gods.	32	2	9
385	 My father told me that when he caught me praying.	32	2	9
386	 My mother just died, you see.	32	2	9
387	 I didn't really understand the concept of death,	32	2	9
388	 the finality of it.	32	2	9
389	 I thought that if I prayed very, very hard,	32	2	9
390	 the Gods would return my mother to me. I was four.	32	2	9
391	 Your father doesn't believe in the Gods?	32	2	9
392	 He believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much.	32	2	9
393	 One for her.	32	2	9
394	 Here.	32	2	9
395	 Sit.	32	2	9
396	 Drink.	32	2	9
397	 Not like that. Drink, girl.	32	2	9
398	 I should have been born a man.	32	2	9
399	 I'd rather face 1,000 swords than be shut up inside	33	2	9
400	 with this flock of frightened hens.	33	2	9
401	 They are your guests under your protection.	33	2	9
402	 You asked them here.	33	2	9
403	 It was expected of me,	33	2	9
404	 as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen.	33	2	9
405	 If my wretched brother should somehow prevail,	33	2	9
406	 these hens will return to their cocks	33	2	9
407	 and crow of how my courage inspired them,	33	2	9
408	 lifted their spirits.	33	2	9
409	 And if the city should fall?	33	2	9
410	 You'd like that, wouldn't you?	33	2	9
411	 The Red Keep should hold for a time,	33	2	9
412	 long enough for me to go to the walls	33	2	9
413	 and yield to Lord Stannis in person.	33	2	9
414	 If it were anyone else outside those gates,	33	2	9
415	 I might have hoped for a private audience.	33	2	9
416	 But this is Stannis Baratheon.	33	2	9
417	 I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse.	33	2	9
418	 Have I shocked you, little dove?	34	2	9
419	 Tears aren't a woman's only weapon.	34	2	9
420	 The best one's between your legs.	34	2	9
421	 Learn how to use it. Drink.	34	2	9
422	 Do you have any notion of what happens	34	2	9
423	 when a city is sacked?	34	2	9
424	 No, you wouldn't, would you?	34	2	9
425	 If the city falls, these fine women	34	2	9
426	 should be in for a bit of a rape.	34	2	9
427	 Half of them will have bastards	34	2	9
428	 in their bellies come the morning.	34	2	9
429	 You'll be glad of your red flower then.	34	2	9
430	 When a man's blood is up,	34	2	9
431	 anything with tits looks good.	34	2	9
432	 A precious thing like you	34	2	9
433	 will look very, very good.	34	2	9
434	 A slice of cake	34	2	9
435	 just waiting to be eaten.	34	2	9
436	 More pressure!	35	2	9
437	 - Pull! Pull! - That's it, men!	35	2	9
438	 Pull! Pull!	35	2	9
439	 That's it! Steady!	35	2	9
440	 He's a serious man-- Stannis Baratheon.	35	2	9
441	 They're coming. They're coming ashore.	35	2	9
442	 Rain fire on them.	35	2	9
443	 Archers!	35	2	9
444	 There are too many.	35	2	9
445	 Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop	35	2	9
446	 that manages to touch solid ground.	35	2	9
447	 Pod, run to the King's gate.	35	2	9
448	 Bring any men guarding it here now.	35	2	9
449	 Yes, My Lord.	35	2	9
450	 Let's go. Stannis is sending us fresh meat.	35	2	9
451	 You, too.	35	2	9
452	 Any of these flaming fucking arrows come near me,	36	2	9
453	 I'll strangle you with your own guts.	36	2	9
454	 Pull, pull! Go!	36	2	9
455	 Nock!	36	2	9
456	 Draw!	36	2	9
457	 - Draw! - Draw!	36	2	9
458	 Kill the Lannisters!	36	2	9
459	 Loose!	36	2	9
460	 Loose!	36	2	9
461	 Form the line!	36	2	9
462	 Stannis!	36	2	9
463	 - Draw! - Draw!	36	2	9
464	 - Loose! - Loose!	36	2	9
465	 They cannot breach the wall!	37	2	9
466	 Yah!	37	2	9
467	 The mud gate, go now!	37	2	9
468	 First and second squads, to the gate! To the mud gate!	37	2	9
469	 Any man dies with a clean sword,	37	2	9
470	 I'll rape his fucking corpse.	37	2	9
471	 When we were young, Jaime and I,	38	2	9
472	 we looked so much alike.	38	2	9
473	 Even our father couldn't tell us apart.	38	2	9
474	 I could never understand why they treated us differently.	38	2	9
475	 Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace,	38	2	9
476	 and I was taught to smile	38	2	9
477	 and sing and please.	38	2	9
478	 He was heir to Casterly Rock	38	2	9
479	 and I was sold to some stranger like a horse	38	2	9
480	 to be ridden whenever he desired.	38	2	9
481	 You were Robert's queen.	39	2	9
482	 And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy.	39	2	9
483	 I don't think I know this one.	39	2	9
484	 Pretty.	39	2	9
485	 That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen.	39	2	9
486	 Here, it's not difficult. I mastered it when I was four.	39	2	9
487	 Straighten your back and bend.	39	2	9
488	 Better. You learn fast.	39	2	9
489	 How long have you been in Lady Sansa's service?	39	2	9
490	 A few weeks, Your Grace.	39	2	9
491	 When did you leave Lorath?	39	2	9
492	 I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.	39	2	9
493	 But she was a nobleman's daughter.	40	2	9
494	 You're not.	40	2	9
495	 When did you come to Westeros?	40	2	9
496	 10 years ago, Your Grace.	40	2	9
497	 From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep	40	2	9
498	 in 10 years, all without learning how to curtsy.	40	2	9
499	 I imagine that's a very interesting story.	40	2	9
500	 What's your name?	40	2	9
501	 Shae, Your Grace.	40	2	9
502	 Tell us a story, Shae.	40	2	9
503	 When I was 13, I--	40	2	9
504	 Your Grace!	40	2	9
505	 What news?	40	2	9
506	 The Imp has set the river afire.	40	2	9
507	 Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more.	40	2	9
508	 Stannis's fleet destroyed, but...	40	2	9
509	 But-- but his troops	40	2	9
510	 have landed outside the city walls.	41	2	9
511	 Where is Joffrey?	41	2	9
512	 On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.	41	2	9
513	 Bring him back inside at once.	41	2	9
514	 - But, Your Grace-- - What?	41	2	9
515	 The King's presence is good for morale.	41	2	9
516	 Bring him back to his chambers now.	41	2	9
517	 - Not here? - With the women and children?	41	2	9
518	 Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life?	41	2	9
519	 - No, but I-- - Now!	41	2	9
520	 When I told you about Ser Ilyn earlier, I lied.	41	2	9
521	 Do you want to hear the truth?	41	2	9
522	 You want to know why he's really here?	41	2	9
523	 He's here for us.	41	2	9
524	 Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne,	41	2	9
525	 but he will not take us alive.	41	2	9
526	 - Ah! Help me!	42	2	9
527	 We'd better run!	42	2	9
528	 Fall back!	42	2	9
529	 Get the ladders up!	43	2	9
530	 Faster, you bastards! Faster!	43	2	9
531	 Come on, kill the scum!	43	2	9
532	 Someone bring me a drink.	43	2	9
533	 Fuck the water. Bring me wine.	43	2	9
534	 Can I get you some iced milk	44	2	9
535	 and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?	44	2	9
536	 Eat shit, dwarf.	44	2	9
537	 You're on the wrong side of the wall.	44	2	9
538	 I lost half my men.	44	2	9
539	 The Blackwater's on fire.	44	2	9
540	 Dog, I command you to go back out there and fight.	44	2	9
541	 You're Kingsguard, Clegane.	44	2	9
542	 You must beat them back or they're going to take this city--	44	2	9
543	 your king's city.	44	2	9
544	 Fuck the Kingsguard.	44	2	9
545	 Fuck the city.	44	2	9
546	 Fuck the King.	44	2	9
547	 Loose!	45	2	9
548	 Put your backs into it!	45	2	9
549	 All right, get up!	45	2	9
550	 Loose!	45	2	9
551	 Clear!	45	2	9
552	 Forward!	45	2	9
553	 Loose!	45	2	9
554	 Forward ladders!	45	2	9
555	 They're coming up the wall!	45	2	9
556	 Archers on the north wall!	46	2	9
557	 - Heave!	46	2	9
558	 - Heave!	46	2	9
559	 Your Grace,	46	2	9
560	 the queen has sent me to bring you back to the Red Keep.	46	2	9
561	 If you won't defend your own city, why should they?	46	2	9
562	 What would you have me do?	46	2	9
563	 Lead.	46	2	9
564	 Get down there and lead your people	46	2	9
565	 against the invaders who want to kill them.	46	2	9
566	 What did my mother say exactly?	46	2	9
567	 Did she have urgent business with me?	46	2	9
568	 She did not say, Your Grace.	46	2	9
569	 All men to the battlements!	46	2	9
570	 Ser Boros, Ser Mandon,	46	2	9
571	 stay with my Uncle and represent the king	46	2	9
572	 on the field of battle.	46	2	9
573	 Archers, hold your line	46	2	9
574	 or I'll kill you myself.	46	2	9
575	 Stand fast!	46	2	9
576	 No!	47	2	9
577	 Get up, you fool.	47	2	9
578	 We need more arrows!	47	2	9
579	 Where is the king?	47	2	9
580	 - Why isn't he with us? - Who are we fighting for?	47	2	9
581	 Who leads us?	47	2	9
582	 I'll lead the attack.	47	2	9
583	 I'll lead the attack!	47	2	9
584	 - Yes? - What are you talking about?	47	2	9
585	 Pod, my helmet.	47	2	9
586	 Ser Mandon, you will bear the King's banner.	47	2	9
587	 Men, form up.	47	2	9
588	 Men--	47	2	9
589	 - men! - Come on.	47	2	9
590	 They say I'm half a man.	47	2	9
591	 But what does that make the lot of you?	47	2	9
592	 The only way out is through the gates.	47	2	9
593	 And they're at the gates.	47	2	9
594	 There's another way out. I'm going to show you.	47	2	9
595	 We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their asses.	48	2	9
596	 Heave!	48	2	9
597	 Heave!	48	2	9
598	 Don't fight for your king	48	2	9
599	 and don't fight for his kingdoms.	48	2	9
600	 Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory.	48	2	9
601	 Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any.	48	2	9
602	 This is your city Stannis means to sack.	48	2	9
603	 That's your gate he's ramming.	48	2	9
604	 If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns,	48	2	9
605	 your gold he steals,	48	2	9
606	 your women he will rape.	48	2	9
607	 Heave! Heave!	48	2	9
608	 Heave! Heave!	48	2	9
609	 Those are brave me knocking at our door.	48	2	9
610	 Let's go kill them.	48	2	9
611	 The battle is lost, Your Grace.	49	2	9
612	 Stannis's troops are at the gates.	49	2	9
613	 When the Gold Cloaks saw the king leaving,	49	2	9
614	 they lost all heart.	49	2	9
615	 Where is my son?	49	2	9
616	 I want to escort him back to the battle.	49	2	9
617	 Why do I care what you want?	49	2	9
618	 - Bring me-- - Now listen to me-- ah!	49	2	9
619	 Don't be afraid. The queen has raised the drawbridge.	49	2	9
620	 This is the safest place we can be.	49	2	9
621	 Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely.	49	2	9
622	 His knights have rallied behind him.	49	2	9
623	 They will save the city.	49	2	9
624	 Shall we sing a hymn?	49	2	9
625	  Gentle mother 	50	2	9
626		50	2	9
627	  save our sons from war, we pray 	50	2	9
628	 -  gentle--  - You must go.	50	2	9
629	 Run to your chamber and bar your door.	50	2	9
630	 Stannis won't hurt you. This one will.	50	2	9
631	 Come with me.	50	2	9
632	 I need to say goodbye to someone.	50	2	9
633	 The queen said they'd rape everyone.	50	2	9
634	 No one is raping me.	50	2	9
635	 Go. Run.	50	2	9
636	  save our sons from war, we pray. 	50	2	9
637	 The lady is starting to panic.	51	2	9
638	 What are you doing here?	51	2	9
639	 Not here for long.	51	2	9
640	 - I'm going. - Where?	51	2	9
641	 Someplace that isn't burning.	51	2	9
642	 North, might be.	51	2	9
643	 Could be.	51	2	9
644	 What about the king?	51	2	9
645	 He can die just fine on his own.	51	2	9
646	 I can take you with me.	51	2	9
647	 Take you to Winterfell.	51	2	9
648	 I'll keep you safe.	52	2	9
649	 Do you want to go home?	52	2	9
650	 I'll be safe here.	52	2	9
651	 Stannis won't hurt me.	52	2	9
652	 Look at me.	52	2	9
653	 Stannis is a killer.	52	2	9
654	 The Lannisters are killers.	52	2	9
655	 Your father was a killer.	52	2	9
656	 Your brother is a killer.	52	2	9
657	 Your sons will be killers someday.	52	2	9
658	 The world is built by killers.	52	2	9
659	 So you'd better get used to looking at them.	52	2	9
660	 You won't hurt me.	52	2	9
661	 No, little bird, I won't hurt you.	53	2	9
662	 Heave! Heave!	53	2	9
663	 Come on, you bastards! Get up those ladders!	53	2	9
664	 Ah!	53	2	9
665	 Attack!	53	2	9
666	 Roll it over!	54	2	9
667	 Halfman! Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!	54	2	9
668	 Halfman! Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!	54	2	9
669	 Oh, fuck me.	54	2	9
670	 Shh.	55	2	9
671	 Be calm, my sweet.	55	2	9
672	 They're still fighting.	55	2	9
673	 No one's going to hurt you.	55	2	9
674	 I'll tell you a story.	55	2	9
675	 You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub?	55	2	9
676	 - They lived in the woods. - The Kingswood.	55	2	9
677	 Yes, my love.	55	2	9
678	 In the Kingswood there lived a mother and her cub.	55	2	9
679	 She loved him very much.	55	2	9
680	 But there were other things that lived in the woods.	55	2	9
681	 - Evil things. - Like what?	56	2	9
682	 Like stags.	56	2	9
683	 Stags aren't evil.	56	2	9
684	 They only eat grass.	56	2	9
685	 And wolves.	56	2	9
686	 My Lord.	56	2	9
687	 He could hear them howling in the night.	56	2	9
688	 The little cub was frightened.	56	2	9
689	" His mother said, ""You are a lion, my son."	56	2	9
690	 You mustn't be afraid.	56	2	9
691	 For one day all the beasts will bow to you.	56	2	9
692	 You will be king.	56	2	9
693	 All the stags will bow.Ts all the wolves will bow.	56	2	9
694	 The bears in the north and the foxes of the south,	56	2	9
695	 all the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea--	56	2	9
696	 they will all come to you, little lion...	57	2	9
697	" to rest a crown upon your head."""	57	2	9
698	 And the cub said,	57	2	9
699	" ""Will I be strong and fierce like my father?"""	57	2	9
700	" ""Yes,"" said his mother."	57	2	9
701	" ""You will be strong and fierce just like your father."""	57	2	9
702	 I will keep you safe, my love.	57	2	9
703	 I promise you.	57	2	9
704	 Back to the boats!	58	2	9
705	 Stand and fight!	58	2	9
706	 Stand and fight, damn you!	58	2	9
707	 No!	58	2	9
708	 Father.	58	2	9
709	 The battle is over. We have won.	58	2	9
710		58	2	9
711	"  ""And who are you,"" the proud lord said "	58	2	9
712	"  ""that I must bow so low? "	58	2	9
713	  only a cat of a different coat 	58	2	9
714	  that's all the truth I know 	58	2	9
715	  in a coat of gold or a coat of red 	59	2	9
716	  a lion still has claws 	59	2	9
717	  and mine are long and sharp, My Lord 	59	2	9
718	"  as long and sharp as yours"" "	59	2	9
719	  and so he spoke, and so he spoke 	59	2	9
720	  that Lord of Castamere 	59	2	9
721	  but now the rains weep o'ver his hall 	59	2	9
722	  with no one there to hear 	59	2	9
723	  yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall 	59	2	9
724	  and not a soul to hear. 	59	2	9
0	 3 Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?	2	1	5
1	 No.	2	1	5
2	 I stood vigil for him myself last night.	2	1	5
3	 He had no one else.	2	1	5
4	 He'd never worn this armor before.	2	1	5
5	 Bad luck for him--	2	1	5
6	 going against the Mountain.	2	1	5
7	 Who determines the draw?	2	1	5
8	 All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.	3	1	5
9	 Aye.	3	1	5
10	 But who holds the straws?	3	1	5
11	 You've done good work, sisters.	3	1	5
12	 Life is strange. Not so many years ago	3	1	5
13	 we fought as enemies at the trident.	3	1	5
14	 I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan.	3	1	5
15	 As is my wife.	3	1	5
16	 I don't think the widow's life would suit her.	3	1	5
17	 You're too modest.	3	1	5
18	 I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.	3	1	5
19	 My father once told me	3	1	5
20	 you were the best he'd ever seen.	3	1	5
21	 I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.	3	1	5
22	 He was a fine man, your father.	3	1	5
23	 What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime.	3	1	5
24	 And that lad--	3	1	5
25	 he was a squire until a few months ago.	3	1	5
26	 How could he afford a new suit of armor?	3	1	5
27	 Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money?	3	1	5
28	 I hear the King wants to joust today.	4	1	5
29	 Yes, that will never happen.	4	1	5
30	 Robert tends to do what he wants.	4	1	5
31	 If the King got what he wanted all the time,	4	1	5
32	 he'd still be fighting a damned rebellion.	4	1	5
33	 It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go.	4	1	5
34	 Your mother was a dumb whore	4	1	5
35	 with a fat ass. Did you know that?	4	1	5
36	 Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains.	4	1	5
37	 He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.	4	1	5
38	 You're too fat for your armor.	4	1	5
39	 Fat? Fat, is it?	4	1	5
40	 Is that how you speak to your King?	4	1	5
41	 That was funny, is it?	4	1	5
42	 No, Your Grace.	5	1	5
43	 No? You don't like the Hand's joke?	5	1	5
44	 You're torturing the poor boy.	5	1	5
45	 You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor.	5	1	5
46	 Go find the breastplate stretcher-- now!	5	1	5
47	" ""The breastplate stretcher""?"	5	1	5
48	 How long before he figures it out?	5	1	5
49	 Maybe you should have one invented.	5	1	5
50	 All right, all right.	5	1	5
51	 But you watch me out there-- I still know how to point a Lance.	5	1	5
52	 You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.	5	1	5
53	 Why, because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!	5	1	5
54	 - And who's going to hit you back? - Anybody who can.	5	1	5
55	 - And the last man in his saddle-- - Will be you.	5	1	5
56	 There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms	5	1	5
57	 would risk hurting you.	5	1	5
58	 Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?	5	1	5
59	 Aye.	5	1	5
60	 - Drink. - I'm not thirsty.	5	1	5
61	 Drink. Your King commands it.	6	1	5
62	 Gods,	6	1	5
63	 too fat for my armor.	6	1	5
64	 Your squire... A Lannister boy?	6	1	5
65	 Mm. A bloody idiot,	6	1	5
66	 but Cersei insisted.	6	1	5
67	 I have Jon Arryn to thank for her.	6	1	5
68	" ""Cersei Lannister will make a good match,"" she told me."	6	1	5
69	" ""You'll need her father on your side."""	6	1	5
70	 I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted.	6	1	5
71	 Enough of this. Let's go watch 'em ride.	6	1	5
72	 At least I can smell someone else's blood.	6	1	5
73	 - Robert? - What?	6	1	5
74	 Oh.	6	1	5
75	 An inspiring sight for the people, eh?	6	1	5
76	 Come, bow before your King! Bow, you shits!	6	1	5
77	 - Where's Arya? - At her dancing lessons.	7	1	5
78	 The knight of the flowers.	7	1	5
79	 Thank you, Ser Loras.	7	1	5
80	 Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.	8	1	5
81	 - Hey. - I can't watch.	8	1	5
82	 100 gold dragons on the Mountain.	8	1	5
83	 I'll take that bet.	8	1	5
84	 Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons?	8	1	5
85	 A dozen barrels of Dornish wine?	8	1	5
86	 Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?	8	1	5
87	 Or you could even buy a friend.	8	1	5
88	 He's going to die.	8	1	5
89	 Ser Loras rides well.	8	1	5
90	 Such a shame, Littlefinger.	9	1	5
91	 It would have been so nice for you to have a friend.	9	1	5
92	 And tell me, Lord Renly,	9	1	5
93	 when will you be having your friend?	9	1	5
94	 Loras knew his mare was in heat.	9	1	5
95	 Quite crafty, really.	9	1	5
96	 Ser Loras would never do that.	9	1	5
97	 There's no honor in tricks.	9	1	5
98	 No honor and quite a bit of gold.	9	1	5
99	 Sword!	9	1	5
100	 Leave him be!	10	1	5
101	 Stop this madness in the name of your King!	10	1	5
102	 Let him go!	10	1	5
103	 I owe you my life, Ser.	11	1	5
104	 I'm no Ser.	11	1	5
105	 Remove his hood.	11	1	5
106	  on that Eve, the captive Imp 	11	1	5
107	  downwards from his horse did limp 	11	1	5
108	  no more would he preen and primp 	11	1	5
109	  in garb of red and gold. 	11	1	5
110	 This isn't the Kingsroad.	11	1	5
111	 You said we were riding for Winterfell.	11	1	5
112	 I did... Often and loudly.	11	1	5
113	 Very wise.	11	1	5
114	 They'll be out in droves,	12	1	5
115	 looking for me in the wrong place.	12	1	5
116	 Word's probably gotten to my father by now.	12	1	5
117	 He'll be offering a handsome reward.	12	1	5
118	 Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts.	12	1	5
119	 Would you be so good as to untie me?	12	1	5
120	 - And why would I do that? - Why not?	12	1	5
121	 Am I going to run?	12	1	5
122	 The hill tribes would kill me for my boots.	12	1	5
123	 Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.	12	1	5
124	 Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.	12	1	5
125	 Ah, the eastern road.	12	1	5
126	 We're going to the Vale.	12	1	5
127	 You're taking me to your sister's	12	1	5
128	 to answer for my imagined crimes.	12	1	5
129	 Tell me, Lady Stark, when was the last time you saw your sister?	12	1	5
130	 Five years ago.	12	1	5
131	 She's changed.	12	1	5
132	 She was always a bit touched, but now--	12	1	5
133	 you might as well kill me here.	12	1	5
134	 - I am not a murderer, Lannister. - Neither am I!	12	1	5
135	 I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life.	12	1	5
136	 - The dagger found-- - What sort of imbecile	13	1	5
137	 arms an assassin with his own blade?	13	1	5
138	 - Should I gag him? - Why?	13	1	5
139	 Am I starting to make sense?	13	1	5
140	 Rodrik!	13	1	5
141	 My Lady, this way.	13	1	5
142	 Untie me.	13	1	5
143	 If I die, what's the point?	13	1	5
144	 Ah!	13	1	5
145	 Rodrik?	14	1	5
146	 I'll be fine, My Lady.	14	1	5
147	 There's no need to bloody yourself.	14	1	5
148	 Your first?	14	1	5
149	 You need a woman.	14	1	5
150	 Nothing like a woman after a fight.	14	1	5
151	 I'm willing if she is.	15	1	5
152	 Bran.	15	1	5
153	 The Iron Islands.	15	1	5
154	 A Kraken.	15	1	5
155	 We do not sow.	15	1	5
156	 - Lords? - The Greyjoys.	15	1	5
157	 Famed for their skills at archery,	15	1	5
158	 navigation and lovemaking.	15	1	5
159	 And failed rebellions.	15	1	5
160	 A stag--	15	1	5
161	 a crowned stag now that Robert's King.	15	1	5
162	 - Good. -  Ours is the fury.	15	1	5
163	 -  The Baratheons. - Mm-hmm.	15	1	5
164	 The Westerlands.	15	1	5
165	 -  A lion. - Mmm.	15	1	5
166	 A Lannister always pays his debts.	15	1	5
167	 No.	15	1	5
168	 A common saying, but not their official motto.	15	1	5
169	 The Lannisters.	16	1	5
170	 - We're still on their words. - I don't know them.	16	1	5
171	 You do know them. Think.	16	1	5
172	" ""Unbowed, unbent, unbroken."""	16	1	5
173	" - That's House Martell. - ""Righteous in wrath."""	16	1	5
174	" - House Hornwood. - ""Family, duty, honor."""	16	1	5
175	 Those are Tully words-- your mother's.	16	1	5
176	 - Are we playing a game? - Family, duty, honor...	16	1	5
177	 - Is that the right order? - You know it is.	16	1	5
178	 Family comes first?	16	1	5
179	 Your mother had to leave Winterfell	16	1	5
180	 to protect the family.	16	1	5
181	 How can she protect the family	16	1	5
182	 if she's not with her family?	16	1	5
183	 Your mother sat by your bed	16	1	5
184	 for three weeks while you slept--	16	1	5
185	 and then she left!	16	1	5
186	 When you were born, I was the one	16	1	5
187	 who pulled you from your mother.	16	1	5
188	 I placed you in her arms.	16	1	5
189	 From that moment until the moment she dies,	17	1	5
190	 she will love you.	17	1	5
191	 Absolutely.	17	1	5
192	 - Fiercely. - Why did she leave?	17	1	5
193	 I still can't tell you,	17	1	5
194	 - but she will be home soon. - Do you know where she is now?	17	1	5
195	 Today?	17	1	5
196	 No, I don't.	17	1	5
197	 Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon?	17	1	5
198	 Sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good.	17	1	5
199	 I'll never shoot another arrow.	17	1	5
200	 And where is that written?	17	1	5
201	 - You need legs to work a bow. - Hmm.	17	1	5
202	 If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works,	17	1	5
203	 you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback.	17	1	5
204	 Really	17	1	5
205	 Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old.	17	1	5
206	 Why shouldn't you?	17	1	5
207	 Shh, keep it down.	18	1	5
208	 You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.	18	1	5
209	 I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.	18	1	5
210	 Important enough for the likes of you.	18	1	5
211	 You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know.	18	1	5
212	 Who, the Imp?	18	1	5
213	 I'd call him half a nobleman.	18	1	5
214	 Jealous?	18	1	5
215	 Why should I be jealous?	18	1	5
216	 Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night.	18	1	5
217	 What's a dwarf like down below?	18	1	5
218	 I've always wondered.	18	1	5
219	 - Might surprise you. - Hmm?	18	1	5
220	 He's good with his fingers too.	18	1	5
221	 And his tongue.	18	1	5
222	 Generous tipper.	18	1	5
223	 I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.	19	1	5
224	 You are jealous.	19	1	5
225	 I'm a Greyjoy.	19	1	5
226	 We've been lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years.	19	1	5
227	 There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us,	19	1	5
228	 not even the Lannisters.	19	1	5
229	 And what about the Starks?	19	1	5
230	 I've been Lord Stark's ward since I was eight years old.	19	1	5
231	 A ward-- that's a nice word for it.	19	1	5
232	 Your father rebelled against King Robert	19	1	5
233	 - and if he does it again-- - My father fought	19	1	5
234	 for the freedom of his people.	19	1	5
235	 What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.	19	1	5
236	 You're a very serious boy.	19	1	5
237	 - I'm not a boy. - Oh yes, you are.	19	1	5
238	 A serious boy with a serious cock.	19	1	5
239	 I don't want to pay for it.	19	1	5
240	 Then get yourself a wife.	19	1	5
241	 Come on.	19	1	5
242	 I'm not gonna hurt you.	20	1	5
243	 How is your son, My Lord?	20	1	5
244	 He'll never walk again.	20	1	5
245	 But his mind is sound?	20	1	5
246	 So they say.	20	1	5
247	 A blessing then.	20	1	5
248	 I suffered an early mutilation myself.	20	1	5
249	 Some doors close forever...	20	1	5
250	 Others open in the most unexpected places.	20	1	5
251	 May I?	20	1	5
252	 If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you,	20	1	5
253	 off comes my head.	20	1	5
254	 And who would mourn poor Varys then?	20	1	5
255	 North or South, they sing no songs for spiders.	21	1	5
256	 But there are things you must know.	21	1	5
257	 You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool--	21	1	5
258	 your friend, I know, but a fool--	21	1	5
259	 and doomed unless you save him.	21	1	5
260	 I've been in the capital a month.	21	1	5
261	 Why have you waited so long to tell me this?	21	1	5
262	 I didn't trust you.	21	1	5
263	 So why do you trust me now?	21	1	5
264	 The Queen is not the only one	21	1	5
265	 who has been watching you closely.	21	1	5
266	 There are few men of honor in the capital.	21	1	5
267	 You are one of them.	21	1	5
268	 I would like to believe I am another,	21	1	5
269	 strange as that may seem.	21	1	5
270	 What sort of doom does the King face?	21	1	5
271	 The same sort as Jon Arryn.	21	1	5
272	 The tears of Lys, they call it.	21	1	5
273	 A rare and costly thing,	21	1	5
274	 as clear and tasteless as water.	21	1	5
275	 It leaves no trace.	21	1	5
276	 Who gave it to him?	22	1	5
277	 Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one?	22	1	5
278	 There were many.	22	1	5
279	 Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man.	22	1	5
280	 There was one boy.	22	1	5
281	 All he was he owed to Jon Arryn.	22	1	5
282	 The squire, Ser Hugh?	22	1	5
283	 Pity what happened to him,	22	1	5
284	 just when his life seemed to be going so nicely.	22	1	5
285	 If Ser Hugh poisoned him--	22	1	5
286	 who paid Ser Hugh?	22	1	5
287	 Someone who could afford it.	22	1	5
288	 Jon was a man of peace.	22	1	5
289	 He was Hand for 17 years--	22	1	5
290	 17 good years.	22	1	5
291	 Why kill him?	22	1	5
292	 He started asking questions.	23	1	5
293	 Man's voice: He's found one bastard already.	23	1	5
294	 He has the book.	23	1	5
295	 The rest will come.	23	1	5
296	 Man #2: And when he knows the truth, what will he do?	23	1	5
297	 The gods alone know.	23	1	5
298	 The fools tried to kill his son.	23	1	5
299	 What's worse-- they botched it.	23	1	5
300	 The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats.	23	1	5
301	 - We will be at war soon, my friend. - What good is war now?	24	1	5
302	 We're not ready.	24	1	5
303	 If one Hand can die, why not a second?	24	1	5
304	 This Hand is not the other.	24	1	5
305	 We need time.	24	1	5
306	 Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born.	24	1	5
307	 You know how these savages are.	24	1	5
308	" ""Delay,"" you say. ""Move fast,"" I reply."	24	1	5
309	 This is no longer a game for two players.	24	1	5
310	 It never was.	24	1	5
311	 The first to arrive and the last to leave.	24	1	5
312	 I admire your industry.	24	1	5
313	 You do move quietly.	25	1	5
314	 We all have our qualities.	25	1	5
315	 You look a bit lonely today.	25	1	5
316	 You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening.	25	1	5
317	 First boy is on the house.	25	1	5
318	 I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.	25	1	5
319	 Am I?	25	1	5
320	 All those birds that whisper in your ear--	25	1	5
321	 such pretty little things.	25	1	5
322	 Trust me,	25	1	5
323	 we accommodate all inclinations.	25	1	5
324	 Oh, I'm sure.	25	1	5
325	 Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear.	25	1	5
326	 I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion--	25	1	5
327	 both equally important.	25	1	5
328	 Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no?	25	1	5
329	 Is it true that	25	1	5
330	 Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?	25	1	5
331	 All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.	25	1	5
332	 And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord	25	1	5
333	 with a taste for fresh cadavers.	26	1	5
334	 Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination.	26	1	5
335	 The logistics alone--	26	1	5
336	 to find beautiful corpses before they rot.	26	1	5
337	 Strictly speaking, such a thing	26	1	5
338	 would not be in accordance with the King's laws.	26	1	5
339	 Strictly speaking.	26	1	5
340	 Tell me-- does someone somewhere	26	1	5
341	 keep your balls in a little box?	26	1	5
342	 I've often wondered.	26	1	5
343	 Do you know I have no idea where they are?	26	1	5
344	 And we had been so close.	26	1	5
345	 But enough about me. How have you been	26	1	5
346	 since we last saw each other?	26	1	5
347	 Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?	26	1	5
348	 Now the last time I saw you,	26	1	5
349	 you were talking to the Hand of the King.	26	1	5
350	 - Saw me with your own eyes? - Eyes I own.	26	1	5
351	 Council business.	26	1	5
352	 We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.	26	1	5
353	 Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness	27	1	5
354	 for Lord Stark's wife.	27	1	5
355	 If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life	27	1	5
356	 and it was discovered that you helped	27	1	5
357	 the Starks come to that conclusion...	27	1	5
358	 To think a simple word to the Queen--	27	1	5
359	 - one shudders at the thought. - Ooh.	27	1	5
360	 But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you	27	1	5
361	 even more recently than you have seen me.	27	1	5
362	 - Have you? - Yes.	27	1	5
363	 Earlier today, I distinctly recall	27	1	5
364	 seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers.	27	1	5
365	 Was that you under the bed?	27	1	5
366	 And not long after that	27	1	5
367	 when I saw you escorting a certain	27	1	5
368	 foreign dignitary...	27	1	5
369	 Council business?	27	1	5
370	 Of course you would have friends from across the Narrow Sea.	27	1	5
371	 You're from there yourself, after all.	27	1	5
372	 We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys?	27	1	5
373	 I'd like to think we are.	28	1	5
374	 So you can imagine my burden,	28	1	5
375	 wondering if the King might question my friend's sympathies.	28	1	5
376	 To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend,	28	1	5
377	 turning right loyalty to the realm--	28	1	5
378	 - Oh, please. - To find myself in a position	28	1	5
379	 where a simple word to the King--	28	1	5
380	 What are you two conspiring about?	28	1	5
381	 Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up.	28	1	5
382	 My brother is coming.	28	1	5
383	 To a small council meeting?	28	1	5
384	 Disturbing news from far away.	28	1	5
385	 Haven't you heard?	28	1	5
386	 Off with you. No begging.	29	1	5
387	 I'm not a beggar. I live here.	29	1	5
388	 D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?	29	1	5
389	 I want to see my father.	29	1	5
390	 I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me.	29	1	5
391	 You want your father, boy?	29	1	5
392	 He's lying on the floor of some tavern,	29	1	5
393	 getting pissed on by his friends.	29	1	5
394	 My father is Hand of the King!	29	1	5
395	 I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell	29	1	5
396	 and if you lay a hand on me, my father	29	1	5
397	 will have both your heads on spikes.	29	1	5
398	 Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you	29	1	5
399	 on the ear to help with your hearing?	29	1	5
400	 You know I had half my guard out searching for you?	29	1	5
401	 You promised me this would stop.	29	1	5
402	 They said they were going to kill you.	29	1	5
403	 - Who did? - I didn't see them,	30	1	5
404	 - but I think one was fat. - Oh, Arya.	30	1	5
405	 I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard	30	1	5
406	 and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage--	30	1	5
407	 something about the savage.	30	1	5
408	 - Where did you hear this? - In the dungeons,	30	1	5
409	 near the dragon skulls.	30	1	5
410	 What were you doing in the dungeons?	30	1	5
411	 Chasing a cat.	30	1	5
412	 Pardon, My Lord.	30	1	5
413	 There's a night's watchman here begging a word.	30	1	5
414	 He says it's urgent.	30	1	5
415	 - Your name, friend? - Yoren, if it please.	30	1	5
416	 This must be your son. He has the look.	30	1	5
417	 I'm a girl!	30	1	5
418	 Did Benjen send you?	30	1	5
419	 No one sent me, My Lord.	30	1	5
420	 I'm here to find men for the Wall,	30	1	5
421	 see if there's any scum in the dungeons	30	1	5
422	 that might be fit for service.	30	1	5
423	 Oh, we'll find recruits for you.	30	1	5
424	 Thank you, My Lord.	30	1	5
425	 But that's not why I disturb you now.	31	1	5
426	 Your brother Benjen, his blood runs black--	31	1	5
427	 makes him as much my brother as yours.	31	1	5
428	 It's for his sake I rode here so hard	31	1	5
429	 I damn near killed my horse.	31	1	5
430	 There are others riding too.	31	1	5
431	 The whole city will know by tomorrow.	31	1	5
432	 Know what?	31	1	5
433	 Best said in private, My Lord.	31	1	5
434	 Go on. We'll talk more later.	31	1	5
435	 Jory, take her safely to her room.	31	1	5
436	 Come along, My Lady. You heard your father.	31	1	5
437	 How many guards does my father have?	31	1	5
438	 Here in King's Landing? 50.	31	1	5
439	 You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?	31	1	5
440	 No fear on that count, little lady.	31	1	5
441	 - Well? - It's about your wife, My Lord.	32	1	5
442	 She's taken the Imp.	32	1	5
443	 You're far from home, Lady Stark.	32	1	5
444	 To whom do I speak?	32	1	5
445	 Ser Vardis Egan, knight of the Vale.	32	1	5
446	 Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?	32	1	5
447	 There was no time to send word.	32	1	5
448	 May I ask, My Lady,	32	1	5
449	 why he is with you?	32	1	5
450	 That's why there was no time.	32	1	5
451	 - He is my prisoner. - He doesn't look like a prisoner.	32	1	5
452	 My sister will decide what he looks like.	32	1	5
453	 Yes, My Lady.	33	1	5
454	 She will at that.	33	1	5
455	 The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.	33	1	5
456	 Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes--	33	1	5
457	 I'll impregnate the bitch.	33	1	5
458	 I like you.	33	1	5
459	 Lord Stark, your presence has been requested	33	1	5
460	 in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called.	33	1	5
461	 I need to see the King first-- alone.	33	1	5
462	 The King is at the small council meeting, My Lord.	33	1	5
463	 He has summoned you.	33	1	5
464	 - Is it about my wife? - No, My Lord.	33	1	5
465	 I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.	33	1	5
466	 The whore is pregnant.	33	1	5
467	 - You're speaking of murdering a child. - I warned you	33	1	5
468	 this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you,	34	1	5
469	 but you didn't care to hear.	34	1	5
470	 Well, hear it now.	34	1	5
471	 I want 'em dead, mother and child both.	34	1	5
472	 And that fool Viserys as well.	34	1	5
473	 Is that plain enough for you?	34	1	5
474	 I want them both dead.	34	1	5
475	 You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.	34	1	5
476	 Honor?!	34	1	5
477	 I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule!	34	1	5
478	 One King, Seven Kingdoms.	34	1	5
479	 Do you think honor keeps them in line?	34	1	5
480	 Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace?	34	1	5
481	 It's fear-- fear and blood.	34	1	5
482	 Then we're no better than the Mad King.	34	1	5
483	 Careful, Ned. Careful now.	34	1	5
484	 You want to assassinate a girl	34	1	5
485	 because the Spider heard a rumor?	34	1	5
486	 No rumor, My Lord. The princess is with child.	34	1	5
487	 Based on whose information?	34	1	5
488	 Ser Jorah Mormont.	34	1	5
489	 He is serving as advisor to the Targaryens.	34	1	5
490	 Mormont? You bring us the whispers	34	1	5
491	 of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?	34	1	5
492	 Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor.	35	1	5
493	 Small difference, I know, to an honorable man.	35	1	5
494	 He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land.	35	1	5
495	 We commit murder on the word of this man?	35	1	5
496	 And if he's right?	35	1	5
497	 If she has a son?	35	1	5
498	 A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army...	35	1	5
499	 - What then? - The Narrow Sea still lies between us.	35	1	5
500	 I'll fear the Dothraki	35	1	5
501	 the day they teach their horses to run on water.	35	1	5
502	 Do nothing?	35	1	5
503	 That's your wise advice?	35	1	5
504	 Do nothing till our enemies are on our shores?	35	1	5
505	 You're my council. Counsel!	35	1	5
506	 Speak sense to this honorable fool.	35	1	5
507	 I understand your misgivings, My Lord.	35	1	5
508	 Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing	35	1	5
509	 we must consider, a vile thing.	35	1	5
510	 Yet we who presume to rule must sometimes	35	1	5
511	 do vile things for the good of the realm.	36	1	5
512	 Should the gods grant Daenerys a son,	36	1	5
513	 the realm will bleed.	36	1	5
514	 I bear this girl no ill will,	36	1	5
515	 but should the Dothraki invade,	36	1	5
516	 how many innocents will die?	36	1	5
517	 How many towns will burn?	36	1	5
518	 Is it not wiser, kinder even,	36	1	5
519	 that she should die now	36	1	5
520	 so that tens of thousands might live?	36	1	5
521	 We should have had them both killed years ago.	36	1	5
522	 When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman,	36	1	5
523	 best close your eyes, get it over with.	36	1	5
524	 Cut her throat. Be done with it.	36	1	5
525	 I followed you into war--	36	1	5
526	 twice,	36	1	5
527	 without doubts,	36	1	5
528	 without second thoughts.	36	1	5
529	 But I will not follow you now.	36	1	5
530	 The Robert I grew up with	37	1	5
531	 didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child.	37	1	5
532	 She dies.	37	1	5
533	 I will have no part in it.	37	1	5
534	 You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark.	37	1	5
535	 You'll do as I command or I'll find me a hand who will.	37	1	5
536	 And good luck to him.	37	1	5
537	 I thought you were a better man.	37	1	5
538	 Out. Out, damn you.	37	1	5
539	 I'm done with you.	37	1	5
540	 Go, run back to Winterfell!	37	1	5
541	 I'll have your head on a spike!	37	1	5
542	 I'll put it there myself, you fool!	37	1	5
543	 You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable?	37	1	5
544	 This is a war!	37	1	5
545	 I'll go ahead with my daughters.	38	1	5
546	 Get them ready. Do it yourself.	38	1	5
547	 - Don't ask anyone for help. - Right away, My Lord.	38	1	5
548	 Lord Baelish is here for you.	38	1	5
549	 His Grace went on about you at some length	38	1	5
550	 after you took your leave.	38	1	5
551	" The word ""treason"" was mentioned."	38	1	5
552	 What can I do for you?	38	1	5
553	 When do you return to Winterfell?	38	1	5
554	 Why? What do you care?	38	1	5
555	 If you're still here come nightfall,	38	1	5
556	 I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn	38	1	5
557	 spoke with before falling ill.	38	1	5
558	 If that sort of thing still interests you.	38	1	5
559	 I don't have the time.	38	1	5
560	 It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.	38	1	5
561	 Round up all the men we have	38	1	5
562	 and station them outside the girls' chambers.	38	1	5
563	 - Who are your best two swords? - Heward and Wyl.	38	1	5
564	 Find them and meet me at the stables.	38	1	5
565	 You bring him here without permission?	39	1	5
566	 You pollute my home with his presence?	39	1	5
567	 Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin,	39	1	5
568	 a very bad thing.	39	1	5
569	 You remember her, don't you?	39	1	5
570	 Isn't he beautiful?	39	1	5
571	 And strong too. Jon knew it.	39	1	5
572	" His last words were ""the seed is strong."""	39	1	5
573	 He wanted everyone to know	39	1	5
574	 what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be.	39	1	5
575	 Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale.	39	1	5
576	 Lysa,	39	1	5
577	 you wrote me about the Lannisters,	39	1	5
578	 - warning me-- - To stay away from them!	39	1	5
579	 Not to bring one here!	39	1	5
580	 Mommy?	39	1	5
581	 - Is that the bad man? - It is.	39	1	5
582	 He's little.	40	1	5
583	 He's Tyrion the imp of house Lannister.	40	1	5
584	 He killed your father.	40	1	5
585	 He murdered the Hand of the King!	40	1	5
586	 Oh, did I kill him too?	40	1	5
587	 I've been a very busy man.	40	1	5
588	 You will watch your tongue!	40	1	5
589	 These men are knights of the Vale.	40	1	5
590	 Every one of them loved Jon Arryn.	40	1	5
591	 Every one of them would die for me.	40	1	5
592	 If any harm comes to me,	40	1	5
593	 my brother Jaime will see that they do.	40	1	5
594	 You can't hurt us.	40	1	5
595	 No one can hurt us here. Tell him, mommy!	40	1	5
596	 - Tell him! - Shh shh shh, my sweet boy.	40	1	5
597	 He's just trying to frighten us.	40	1	5
598	 Lannisters are all liars.	40	1	5
599	 No one will hurt my baby.	40	1	5
600	 Mommy...	40	1	5
601	 I want to see the bad man fly.	40	1	5
602	 Perhaps you will, my little love.	40	1	5
603	 This man is my prisoner.	40	1	5
604	 I will not have him harmed.	41	1	5
605	 Ser Vardis,	41	1	5
606	 my sister's guest is weary.	41	1	5
607	 Take him down below so he can rest.	41	1	5
608	 Introduce him to Mord.	41	1	5
609	 You go sleep, dwarf man.	41	1	5
610	 Sleep good, little dwarf man!	41	1	5
611	 Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.	42	1	5
612	 Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything.	42	1	5
613	 He adores the man.	42	1	5
614	 You're jealous.	42	1	5
615	 Are you sure this won't hurt?	42	1	5
616	 Only if I slip.	42	1	5
617	 - And you'd prefer me like this? - Mm-hmm.	42	1	5
618	 If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy.	42	1	5
619	 I want you.	42	1	5
620	 My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man.	42	1	5
621	 He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child.	42	1	5
622	 Oh, and you're not?	42	1	5
623	 Loras Tyrell, the knight of the flowers?	42	1	5
624	 How many wars have you fought in?	42	1	5
625	 Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?	42	1	5
626	 Hold still.	42	1	5
627	 All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough,	42	1	5
628	 how I squirm at the sight of blood--	43	1	5
629	 you did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the melee.	43	1	5
630	 His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!	43	1	5
631	 He shouldn't have entered the melee if he didn't know how to fight.	43	1	5
632	 Easy for you to say.	43	1	5
633	 Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.	43	1	5
634	 It's not a gift. No one gave it to me.	43	1	5
635	 I'm good because I work at it--	43	1	5
636	 every day of my life since I could hold a stick.	43	1	5
637	 I could work at fighting all day, every day,	43	1	5
638	 and still never be as good as you.	43	1	5
639	 Yes well, I guess we'll never know.	43	1	5
640	 - Everywhere? - Everywhere.	43	1	5
641	 So how did it end up?	43	1	5
642	 The Targaryen girl will die?	43	1	5
643	 It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is.	43	1	5
644	 Robert's rather tasteless about it.	43	1	5
645	 Every time he talks about killing her,	43	1	5
646	 I swear the table rises six inches.	43	1	5
647	 It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.	43	1	5
648	 He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money.	44	1	5
649	 You have to give it to the Lannisters--	44	1	5
650	 they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts	44	1	5
651	 the gods ever suffered to walk the world,	44	1	5
652	 but they do have outrageous amounts of money.	44	1	5
653	 I have an outrageous amount of money.	44	1	5
654	 Not as much as the Lannisters.	44	1	5
655	 But a lot more than you.	44	1	5
656	 Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him.	44	1	5
657	 Last time we were out there for two weeks.	44	1	5
658	 Tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day,	44	1	5
659	 all so he can stick his spear into something's flesh.	44	1	5
660	 Oh. But Robert loves his killing.	44	1	5
661	 - And he's the King. - Hmm.	44	1	5
662	 - How did that ever happen? - Because he loves his killing.	44	1	5
663	 And he used to be good at it.	44	1	5
664	 Do you know who should be king?	44	1	5
665	 - Be serious. - I am.	44	1	5
666	 My father could be your bank.	44	1	5
667	 I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you.	44	1	5
668	 I'm fourth in line.	45	1	5
669	 And where was Robert in the line of royal succession?	45	1	5
670	 Joffrey is a monster.	45	1	5
671	 - Tommen is eight. - Stannis?	45	1	5
672	 Stannis has the personality of a lobster.	45	1	5
673	 He's still my older brother.	45	1	5
674	 - What are you doing?! - Look at it.	45	1	5
675	 You cut me.	45	1	5
676	 It's just blood. We've all got it in us.	45	1	5
677	 Sometimes a little spills.	45	1	5
678	 If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this.	45	1	5
679	 You need to get used to it.	45	1	5
680	 Go on. Look.	45	1	5
681	 People love you.	45	1	5
682	 They love to serve you because you're kind to them.	45	1	5
683	 They want to be near you.	45	1	5
684	 You're willing to do what needs to be done,	45	1	5
685	 but you don't gloat over it.	45	1	5
686	 You don't love killing.	45	1	5
687	 Where is it written that power	45	1	5
688	 is the sole province of the worst?	46	1	5
689	 That thrones are only made	46	1	5
690	 for the hated and the feared?	46	1	5
691	 You would be a wonderful King.	46	1	5
692	 I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out.	46	1	5
693	 You seemed so good together.	46	1	5
694	 I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.	46	1	5
695	 Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces.	46	1	5
696	 I suppose this is where you tell me	46	1	5
697	 to give the job to your brother Jaime.	46	1	5
698	 No.	46	1	5
699	 He's not serious enough.	46	1	5
700	 I'll say this for Ned 	46	1	5
701	 He's serious enough.	47	1	5
702	 Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?	47	1	5
703	 I don't know.	47	1	5
704	 But I do know this:	47	1	5
705	 If the Targaryen girl convinces her horselord husband to invade	47	1	5
706	 and the Dothraki horde crosses the Narrow Sea...	47	1	5
707	 We won't be able to stop them.	47	1	5
708	 The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that.	47	1	5
709	 They don't have discipline. They don't have armor.	47	1	5
710	 They don't have siege weapons.	47	1	5
711	 It's a neat little trick you do:	47	1	5
712	 You move your lips and your father's voice comes out.	47	1	5
713	 Is my father wrong?	47	1	5
714	 Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands	47	1	5
715	 with 40,000 Dothraki screamers at his back.	47	1	5
716	 We hole up in our castles--	48	1	5
717	 a wise move-- only a fool	48	1	5
718	 would meet the Dothraki in an open field.	48	1	5
719	 They leave us in our castles.	48	1	5
720	 They go from town to town, looting and burning,	48	1	5
721	 killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall,	48	1	5
722	 stealing all our crops and livestock,	48	1	5
723	 enslaving all our women and children.	48	1	5
724	 How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind	48	1	5
725	 their absentee King, their cowardly King	48	1	5
726	 hiding behind high walls?	48	1	5
727	 When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen	48	1	5
728	 is the rightful monarch after all?	48	1	5
729	 We still outnumber them.	48	1	5
730	 Which is the bigger number: Five or one?	48	1	5
731	 Five.	48	1	5
732	 Five...	48	1	5
733	 One.	49	1	5
734	 One army-- a real army	49	1	5
735	 united behind one leader with one purpose.	49	1	5
736	 Our purpose died with the Mad King.	49	1	5
737	 Now we've got as many armies	49	1	5
738	 as there are men with gold in their purse.	49	1	5
739	 And everybody wants something different.	49	1	5
740	 Your father wants to own the world.	49	1	5
741	 Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow.	49	1	5
742	 What do you want?	49	1	5
743	 We haven't had a real fight in nine years.	49	1	5
744	 Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight.	49	1	5
745	 And that's all the realm is now:	49	1	5
746	 Back-stabbing and scheming	49	1	5
747	 and arse-licking and money-grubbing.	49	1	5
748	 Sometimes I don't know what holds it together.	50	1	5
749	 Our marriage.	50	1	5
750	 Ah, so here we sit	50	1	5
751	 17 years later,	50	1	5
752	 holding it all together.	50	1	5
753	 Don't you get tired?	50	1	5
754	 Every day.	50	1	5
755	 How long can hate hold a thing together?	50	1	5
756	 Well, 17 years is quite a long time.	50	1	5
757	 Yes, it is.	50	1	5
758	 Yes, it is.	50	1	5
759	 What was she like?	50	1	5
760	 You've never asked about her, not once.	50	1	5
761	 Why not?	51	1	5
762	 At first, just saying her name even in private	51	1	5
763	 felt like I was breathing life back into her.	51	1	5
764	 I thought if I didn't talk about her,	51	1	5
765	 she'd just fade away for you.	51	1	5
766	 When I realized that wasn't going to happen,	51	1	5
767	 I refused to ask out of spite.	51	1	5
768	 I didn't want to give you the satisfaction	51	1	5
769	 of thinking I cared enough to ask.	51	1	5
770	 And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you.	51	1	5
771	 As far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it.	51	1	5
772	 So why now?	51	1	5
773	 What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us	51	1	5
774	 that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?	51	1	5
775	 You want to know the horrible truth?	51	1	5
776	 I can't even remember what she looked like.	51	1	5
777	 I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted...	52	1	5
778	 Someone took her away from me,	52	1	5
779	 and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind.	52	1	5
780	 I felt something for you once, you know?	52	1	5
781	 I know.	52	1	5
782	 Even after we lost our first boy.	52	1	5
783	 For quite a while, actually.	52	1	5
784	 Was it ever possible for us?	52	1	5
785	 Was there ever a time, ever a moment?	52	1	5
786	 No.	52	1	5
787	 Does that make you feel better or worse?	53	1	5
788	 It doesn't make me feel anything.	53	1	5
789	 She looks like him, don't she, My Lord?	53	1	5
790	 She has his nose, his black hair.	53	1	5
791	 Aye.	53	1	5
792	 Tell him when you see him, My Lord.	53	1	5
793	 If it please you, tell him how beautiful she is.	53	1	5
794	 I will.	53	1	5
795	 And tell him I've been with no one else.	53	1	5
796	 I swear it, My Lord, by the old gods and new.	53	1	5
797	 I don't want no jewels or nothing,	53	1	5
798	 just him.	54	1	5
799	 The King was always good to me.	54	1	5
800	 When Jon Arryn came to visit you,	54	1	5
801	 what did he want?	54	1	5
802	 He wasn't that sort of man, My Lord.	54	1	5
803	 He just wanted to know if the child was happy,	54	1	5
804	 healthy.	54	1	5
805	 He looks healthy enough to me.	54	1	5
806	 The girl shall want for nothing.	54	1	5
807	 Brothels make a much better investment than ships,	54	1	5
808	 I've found.	54	1	5
809	 Whores rarely sink.	54	1	5
810	 What do you know of King Robert's bastards?	54	1	5
811	 Well, he has more than you, for a start.	54	1	5
812	 -  How many? - Does it matter?	54	1	5
813	 If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents.	54	1	5
814	 And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?	55	1	5
815	 He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after.	55	1	5
816	 He was overcome with fatherly love.	55	1	5
817	 Come.	55	1	5
818	 - Jory! - My Lord.	55	1	5
819	 Such a small pack of wolves.	55	1	5
820	 Stay back, Ser. This is the Hand of the King.	55	1	5
821	 Was the Hand of the King.	55	1	5
822	 Now I'm not sure what he is--	55	1	5
823	 lord of somewhere very far away.	55	1	5
824	 What's the meaning of this, Lannister?	55	1	5
825	 Get back inside where it's safe.	56	1	5
826	 I'm looking for my brother.	56	1	5
827	 You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark?	56	1	5
828	 Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man.	56	1	5
829	 I remember him well.	56	1	5
830	 It seems he had some trouble on the road.	56	1	5
831	 You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?	56	1	5
832	 He was taken at my command	56	1	5
833	 to answer for his crimes.	56	1	5
834	 My lords!	56	1	5
835	 I'll bring the city watch.	56	1	5
836	 Come, Stark.	56	1	5
837	 I'd rather you die sword in hand.	56	1	5
838	 - If you threaten My Lord again-- - Threaten?	56	1	5
839	" As in, ""I'm going to open your lord"	56	1	5
840	" from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of""?"	56	1	5
841	 You kill me,	56	1	5
842	 your brother's a dead man.	56	1	5
843	 You're right.	56	1	5
844	 Take him alive. Kill his men.	56	1	5
845	 Yah!	58	1	5
846	 My brother, Lord Stark--	58	1	5
847	 we want him back.	58	1	5

9	 Of course its a joke, just not a very funny one.	2	4	7
10	 I couldnt	2	4	7
11	 I couldnt listen to her	2	4	7
12	 standing there telling her lies.	2	4	7
13	 I couldnt do it.	2	4	7
14	 You fell in love with a whore.	2	4	7
15	 Yes, I fell in love with a whore.	2	4	7
16	 And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me.	2	4	7
17	 That deal you made,	3	4	7
18	 it was everything Father wanted.	3	4	7
19	 You do see that?	3	4	7
20	 He gets you back as his heir.	3	4	7
21	 The future Lord of the Rock.	3	4	7
22	 And he ships me off to Castle Black,	3	4	7
23	 out of sight at last.	3	4	7
24	 All so perfect.	3	4	7
25	 It felt good to take that from him.	3	4	7
26	 He knows Im innocent and hes willing to sacrifice me anyway.	3	4	7
27	 Hes willing to sacrifice any of us.	3	4	7
28	 Not you.	3	4	7
29	 Youre the golden son.	3	4	7
30	 You could kill a king, lose a hand,	3	4	7
31	 fuck your own sister, youll always be the golden son.	3	4	7
32	 Careful.	3	4	7
33	 Im the last friend youve got.	3	4	7
34	 At least I got to tell them what they really are.	3	4	7
35	 Yes, brilliant speech.	3	4	7
36	 Theyll be talking about it for days to come.	4	4	7
37	 I thought you were a realist.	4	4	7
38	 Didnt realize youd die for pride.	4	4	7
39	 Dont give up on me just yet.	4	4	7
40	 I survived one trial by combat,	4	4	7
41	 even though you werent there to save me.	4	4	7
42	 I cant save you this time either.	4	4	7
43	 My training has proved	4	4	7
44	 that I cant beat a stable boy with my left hand.	4	4	7
45	 Wheres your sense of adventure?	4	4	7
46	 Even if you lose, imagine the look	4	4	7
47	 on Fathers face when you fall.	4	4	7
48	  (chuckles)  Our family name snuffed out	4	4	7
49	 with a single swing of the sword.	4	4	7
50	 It is tempting.	4	4	7
51	 (laughs)	4	4	7
52	 Well	5	4	7
53	 Bronn fought for me once, hell do it again.	5	4	7
54	 If he wins,	5	4	7
55	 I expect Ill be in his debt	5	4	7
56	 for the rest of my life.	5	4	7
57	 If he wins.	5	4	7
58	 Will you find him for me?	5	4	7
59	 Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion?	5	4	7
60	 I hope its Ser Meryn Trant.	5	4	7
61	 Id enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.	5	4	7
62	 No.	5	4	7
63	 Not Ser Meryn.	5	4	7
64	 (shouting)	5	4	7
65	 (gasping)	5	4	7
66	   Go on, move it.	5	4	7
67	 And you.	5	4	7
68	 Come on.	6	4	7
69	 (shouting)	6	4	7
70	 Mercy.	6	4	7
71	 Please.	6	4	7
72	 Please, mercy.	6	4	7
73	 (grunting)	6	4	7
74	 (shouts)	6	4	7
75	 Ser Gregor. Welcome to the capital.	6	4	7
76	 Thank you for riding here so quickly.	6	4	7
77	 You seem to be in good form.	6	4	7
78	 Who am I fighting?	6	4	7
79	 Does it matter?	6	4	7
80	 Could be food.	7	4	7
81	 Could be soldiers.	7	4	7
82	 (man groaning)	7	4	7
83	 You shouldnt be sitting out here like this.	7	4	7
84	 Where else to sit?	7	4	7
85	 Tried to walk back to my hut,	8	4	7
86	 hurt too much.	8	4	7
87	 Then I remembered they burned my hut down.	8	4	7
88	 Who were they?	8	4	7
89	 I stopped asking a while ago.	8	4	7
90	 Thats not gonna get better.	8	4	7
91	 Doesnt seem so.	8	4	7
92	 A bad way to go.	8	4	7
93	 Havent you had enough?	8	4	7
94	 Of what?	8	4	7
95	 I know.	8	4	7
96	 Time to go.	8	4	7
97	 Take matters into my own hands.	8	4	7
98	 (groans)	8	4	7
99	 The thought has occurred to me.	8	4	7
100	 So why go on?	8	4	7
101	 Habit.	9	4	7
102	 Nothing could be worse than this.	9	4	7
103	 Maybe nothing is worse than this.	9	4	7
104	 Nothing isnt better or worse than anything.	9	4	7
105	 Nothing is just nothing.	9	4	7
106	 Who are you?	9	4	7
107	 My name is Arya.	9	4	7
108	 Arya Stark.	9	4	7
109	 You her father?	9	4	7
110	 Her captor.	9	4	7
111	 Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.	9	4	7
112	 A fair exchange, that is.	9	4	7
113	 Always held to the notion of fair exchange	9	4	7
114	 in all my dealings.	10	4	7
115	 You give me, I give you.	10	4	7
116	 Fair.	10	4	7
117	 A balance.	10	4	7
118	 No balance anymore.	10	4	7
119	 (groans)	10	4	7
120	 Could I have a drink?	10	4	7
121	 Dying is thirsty work.	10	4	7
122	 Wish it were wine.	10	4	7
123	 So do I.	10	4	7
124	 (grunts)	10	4	7
125	 Thats where the heart is.	11	4	7
126	 Thats how you kill a man.	11	4	7
127	 (grunting)	11	4	7
128	 (neck snaps)	11	4	7
129	 (groaning)	11	4	7
130	 The fuck you doing?	11	4	7
131	 Theres a price on your head.	11	4	7
132	 Guess thats what the king does when you tell him to fuck off.	11	4	7
133	 The kings dead.	11	4	7
134	 He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding.	11	4	7
135	 The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers.	11	4	7
136	 100 silver stags.	11	4	7
137	 And you thought you were going to collect it?	11	4	7
138	 Didnt think very hard, did you?	11	4	7
139	 You were Yorens prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall.	11	4	7
140	 He told me hed fuck me bloody with a stick.	12	4	7
141	 This days really not working out the way you planned.	12	4	7
142	 He on your little list?	12	4	7
143	 He cant be.	12	4	7
144	 I dont know his name.	12	4	7
145	 Whats your name?	12	4	7
146	  Rorge.  Thank you.	12	4	7
147	 (gasps)	12	4	7
148	 Youre learning.	12	4	7
149	   (horn blows)   Rangers returning!	12	4	7
150	 (hammering metal)	12	4	7
151	   They return!	12	4	7
152	   Rangers returning!  Greetings.	12	4	7
153	   Didnt think Id see you again.	12	4	7
154	 All right, Jon?	12	4	7
155	 Welcome back, brother.	12	4	7
156	 (men shouting)	13	4	7
157	 Lord Snow.	13	4	7
158	 (Ghost barks)	13	4	7
159	 This is no place for wild beasts.	13	4	7
160	 Lock him away	13	4	7
161	 or Ill let Hobb throw him in tonights stew.	13	4	7
162	 (men shouting)	13	4	7
163	 Come on, Ghost.	13	4	7
164	 Mances army was closing in on Crasters Keep when we left.	13	4	7
165	 We saw their campfires from Osrics Hill.	13	4	7
166	 Theyll reach the Wall before the next full moon.	13	4	7
167	 Im surprised you didnt ride over and say hello.	13	4	7
168	 The King-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isnt he?	13	4	7
169	 We need to prepare.	14	4	7
170	 Weve been preparing.	14	4	7
171	 We should seal the tunnel.	14	4	7
172	 (men murmuring)	14	4	7
173	 Plug it with rocks and ice.	14	4	7
174	 Flood it and let it freeze.	14	4	7
175	   And how would we range north?	14	4	7
176	  We wouldnt.   Coward.	14	4	7
177	 You would cut off our legs,	14	4	7
178	 pluck out our eyes,	14	4	7
179	 leave us cowering behind the Wall	14	4	7
180	 hoping for the storm to pass?	14	4	7
181	 We cant defend the gate against 100,000 men.	14	4	7
182	 This castle has stood for thousands of years.	14	4	7
183	 The Nights Watch has defended her for thousands of years.	14	4	7
184	 And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel.	14	4	7
185	 Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser?	14	4	7
186	 I have. The tunnels gate wont stop them.	14	4	7
187	 The bars on those gates are four inches thick.	14	4	7
188	 Cold-rolled steel.	14	4	7
189	 And they wont stop them.	14	4	7
190	 Remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow.	14	4	7
191	 The stewards.	14	4	7
192	 Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel?	15	4	7
193	 No.	15	4	7
194	 Who would that be?	15	4	7
195	  The builders.  Ah, the builders.	15	4	7
196	 First Builder Yarwyck,	15	4	7
197	 Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel,	15	4	7
198	 leaving us unable to carry out our duties	15	4	7
199	 as sworn brothers of the Nights Watch.	15	4	7
200	 Do you agree with him?	15	4	7
201	 No.	15	4	7
202	   Given your deep knowledge of the wildling army, Lord Snow,	15	4	7
203	 you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall	15	4	7
204	 until the full moon.	15	4	7
205	 (men laughing)	15	4	7
206	 Moving on.	15	4	7
207	 First Builder, well need 100 barrels of pitch brought atop the wall.	15	4	7
208	   Aye.	16	4	7
209	 (door opens)	16	4	7
210	 (footsteps)	16	4	7
211	 My lord.	16	4	7
212	 You have new clothes.	16	4	7
213	 Do you like em? Eh?	16	4	7
214	 Gloves are doeskin.	16	4	7
215	 Softer than a virgins thighs.	16	4	7
216	 I sent for you days ago.	16	4	7
217	  Ive been a bit busy.  Doing what?	16	4	7
218	 My lonesome bachelor days are over.	16	4	7
219	 Im to wed Lollys Stokeworth.	17	4	7
220	 Lollys Stokeworth?	17	4	7
221	 She doesnt strike me as your sort of girl.	17	4	7
222	 I wouldnt say I had a single sort of girl.	17	4	7
223	 Shes dim-witted.	17	4	7
224	 If I wanted wits, Id marry you.	17	4	7
225	 When my sister arranged this love match,	17	4	7
226	 did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?	17	4	7
227	 Falyse.	17	4	7
228	 Aye, I did know about the older sister.	17	4	7
229	 And you understand the rules of inheritance?	17	4	7
230	 Falyse is 40 and barren.	17	4	7
231	 She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.	17	4	7
232	 She does.	17	4	7
233	 Unless she happens to perish before her father.	17	4	7
234	 Then Lollys gets the castle.	17	4	7
235	 What? Ladies fall from their horses	17	4	7
236	 and snap their pretty necks all the time.	17	4	7
237	 You and my sister deserve each other.	17	4	7
238	 Why did you bother to come here?	17	4	7
239	 You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out,	18	4	7
240	 youd double their price.	18	4	7
241	 Is it two wives you want or two castles?	18	4	7
242	 One of each will do.	18	4	7
243	 But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you,	18	4	7
244	 itd better be a damn big castle.	18	4	7
245	 Im a bit short on castles at the moment.	18	4	7
246	 But I can offer you gold and gratitude.	18	4	7
247	 I have gold.	18	4	7
248	 What can I buy with gratitude?	18	4	7
249	 You might be surprised.	18	4	7
250	 A Lannister always pays his debts.	18	4	7
251	 Your sisters a Lannister, too.	18	4	7
252	 My wife is heir to Winterfell.	18	4	7
253	 If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders,	18	4	7
254	 I may one day rule the North in her name.	18	4	7
255	 I could carve you out a big piece of it.	18	4	7
256	 If and may and could.	18	4	7
257	 Its bloody cold up north.	18	4	7
258	 Lollys is soft and warm.	18	4	7
259	 And close.	19	4	7
260	 If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys	19	4	7
261	 and fighting the Mountain, youd have your britches down	19	4	7
262	 and your cock out before I could blink.	19	4	7
263	 Does he frighten you so much?	19	4	7
264	 Id be a bloody fool if he didnt frighten me.	19	4	7
265	 Hes freakish big and freakish strong.	19	4	7
266	 And quicker than youd expect for a man of that size.	19	4	7
267	 Maybe I could take him,	19	4	7
268	 dance around until hes so tired	19	4	7
269	 of hacking at me, he dropped his sword,	19	4	7
270	 get him off his feet somehow.	19	4	7
271	 But one misstep	19	4	7
272	 (snaps fingers) and Im dead.	19	4	7
273	 Why should I risk it?	19	4	7
274	 Because youre my friend.	19	4	7
275	 Aye, Im your friend.	19	4	7
276	 And when have you ever risked your life for me?	19	4	7
277	 I like you,	20	4	7
278	 pampered little shit that you are.	20	4	7
279	 I just like myself more.	20	4	7
280	 I understand.	20	4	7
281	 Im sorry it has to be this way.	20	4	7
282	 Why are you sorry?	20	4	7
283	 Because youre an evil bastard	20	4	7
284	 with no conscience and no heart?	20	4	7
285	 Thats what I liked about you in the first place.	20	4	7
286	 We had some good days together.	20	4	7
287	 Yes, we did.	20	4	7
288	 (bangs on door)	20	4	7
289	 What will you do?	20	4	7
290	 I suppose Ill have to kill the Mountain myself.	20	4	7
291	 Wont that make for a great song?	20	4	7
292	 I hope to hear them sing it one day.	21	4	7
293	 (bird screeching)	21	4	7
294	 How did you get in here?	21	4	7
295	 Your door is well guarded,	21	4	7
296	 but your window is not.	21	4	7
297	 I swam to an island a mile offshore for these.	21	4	7
298	 Dont do that again.	21	4	7
299	 Never met a woman who didnt like wildflowers.	21	4	7
300	 These are my private quarters.	21	4	7
301	 If I want you here, I will summon you.	21	4	7
302	 Forgive me, my queen. I live to serve you.	22	4	7
303	 Tell me why youre here.	22	4	7
304	 I came to ask a favor.	22	4	7
305	 I only have two talents in this world	22	4	7
306	 war and women.	22	4	7
307	 You are staying here in Meereen to rule.	22	4	7
308	 That is a wise decision. I respect it.	22	4	7
309	 But here in Meereen, I cannot pursue my talents.	22	4	7
310	 Ive ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets	22	4	7
311	 to stop the revenge killing.	22	4	7
312	 Youve ordered us to be night watchmen.	22	4	7
313	 And as for women,	22	4	7
314	 there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue.	22	4	7
315	 There is only one,	22	4	7
316	 and she does not want me.	22	4	7
317	 You swore me your sword.	22	4	7
318	 My sword is yours till the day I die.	22	4	7
319	 So if I command you to stay in Meereen	23	4	7
320	 and patrol the streets?	23	4	7
321	 Ill stay in Meereen and patrol the streets.	23	4	7
322	 Send me to kill your enemies.	23	4	7
323	 Any enemy anywhere.	23	4	7
324	 Let me do what I do best.	23	4	7
325	 Very well.	23	4	7
326	 Do what you do best.	23	4	7
327	 Take off your clothes.	23	4	7
328	 (knocks)	24	4	7
329	 Oh.	24	4	7
330	 Come in, my queen. Please.	24	4	7
331	 I didnt mean to disturb you, my lady.	24	4	7
332	 You could never disturb me.	24	4	7
333	 I just wanted to speak with you before we left.	24	4	7
334	 Could you bring me that vial over there?	24	4	7
335	 The blue one.	24	4	7
336	 No, no, no. Not that one.	24	4	7
337	 You dont even want to touch that one.	24	4	7
338	 Next to it.	24	4	7
339	 Thats the one.	24	4	7
340	 (inhales)	25	4	7
341	 When I looked into the flames this morning,	25	4	7
342	 the Lord spoke to me.	25	4	7
343	 He said,	25	4	7
344	 Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while.	25	4	7
345	 Make it count.	25	4	7
346	 A joke.	25	4	7
347	 Not a very good one, Im afraid.	25	4	7
348	 It was. I	25	4	7
349	 humor isnt my strength.	25	4	7
350	 Thats because most jokes are lies	25	4	7
351	 and youre devoted to the truth.	25	4	7
352	 If theyre lies, my lady, arent they best avoided?	25	4	7
353	 Not always.	25	4	7
354	 Most of these powders and potions	26	4	7
355	 are lies.	26	4	7
356	 Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lords power.	26	4	7
357	 Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was	26	4	7
358	 a trick that lead them to the truth.	26	4	7
359	 A pinch of this powder in a bonfire	26	4	7
360	 will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky.	26	4	7
361	 And this one creates a black smoke	26	4	7
362	 that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear.	26	4	7
363	 And a drop of this in any mans wine	26	4	7
364	 will drive him wild with lust.	26	4	7
365	 Did you use it with Stannis?	26	4	7
366	 No.	26	4	7
367	 Dont be upset.	27	4	7
368	 Men never crave what they already have.	27	4	7
369	 Its only flesh.	27	4	7
370	 It needs what it needs.	27	4	7
371	 No act done in service of the Lord	27	4	7
372	 can ever be called a sin.	27	4	7
373	 I thank God every day for bringing you to us.	27	4	7
374	 And Stannis to you.	27	4	7
375	 He wants to bring Shireen with us.	27	4	7
376	 I think that would be ill-advised.	27	4	7
377	 My daughter has heretical tendencies, as youre well aware.	27	4	7
378	 I dont know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me,	27	4	7
379	 but whichever the case, she should stay home.	27	4	7
380	 I understand how you feel.	28	4	7
381	 Hmm.	28	4	7
382	 But that is impossible.	28	4	7
383	 Why?	28	4	7
384	 You dont need powders and potions, my queen.	28	4	7
385	 You dont need lies.	28	4	7
386	 You are strong enough to look into the Lords light	28	4	7
387	 and see his truth for yourself.	28	4	7
388	 However harsh it is.	28	4	7
389	 However hard for us to understand.	28	4	7
390	 You dont need my help,	28	4	7
391	 but I will need yours soon.	28	4	7
392	 When we set sail, your daughter must be with us.	28	4	7
393	 The Lord needs her.	28	4	7
394	 Jorah the Andal.	29	4	7
395	 Are you here to see our queen?	29	4	7
396	 Shes in a good mood.	29	4	7
397	 Khaleesi.	29	4	7
398	  Youre here early.  Later than some.	29	4	7
399	 You dont approve?	29	4	7
400	 Its not a question of approval, its a question of trust.	29	4	7
401	 You neither approve nor trust.	29	4	7
402	 Why would I? The mans a sellsword.	29	4	7
403	 Didnt you fight for the Golden Company	29	4	7
404	 before pledging your sword to my brother?	29	4	7
405	 I did.	29	4	7
406	 I trust you.	29	4	7
407	 Daario Naharis killed his captains	29	4	7
408	 and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands.	30	4	7
409	 How could you ever have faith in a man like that?	30	4	7
410	 I could never have faith in a man like Daario.	30	4	7
411	 Thats why Ive sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.	30	4	7
412	  You have?  I have.	30	4	7
413	 Without you there to rule, Khaleesi,	30	4	7
414	 I fear the masters will simply bide their time,	30	4	7
415	 wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control.	30	4	7
416	 That is why Ive ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai.	30	4	7
417	 The masters tear babies from their mothers arms.	30	4	7
418	 They mutilate little boys by the thousands.	30	4	7
419	 They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men.	30	4	7
420	 They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself.	30	4	7
421	 Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands	30	4	7
422	 is also treating men like beasts.	30	4	7
423	 The slaves you freed,	30	4	7
424	 brutality is all theyve ever known.	30	4	7
425	 If you want them to know something else,	31	4	7
426	 youll have to show it to them.	31	4	7
427	 And repay the slavers with what? Kindness?	31	4	7
428	 A fine? A stern warning?	31	4	7
429	 Its tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them,	31	4	7
430	 but theres good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought.	31	4	7
431	 Let the priests argue over good and evil.	31	4	7
432	 Slavery is real.	31	4	7
433	 I can end it. I will end it.	31	4	7
434	 And I will end those behind it.	31	4	7
435	 I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi.	31	4	7
436	 And now you are helping me show them to freedom.	31	4	7
437	 I wouldnt be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me	31	4	7
438	 what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.	31	4	7
439	 The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.	31	4	7
440	 Hizdahr zo Loraq?	31	4	7
441	 He will accompany the Second Sons	31	4	7
442	 and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai.	31	4	7
443	 He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen.	32	4	7
444	 He will explain the choice they have before them.	32	4	7
445	 They can live in my new world	32	4	7
446	 or they can die in their old one.	32	4	7
447	 Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves.	32	4	7
448	 Tell him I changed my mind.	32	4	7
449	 Yes, Khaleesi.	32	4	7
450	 No.	32	4	7
451	 Tell him you changed my mind.	32	4	7
452	 (Hound grunts) Rat cunts.	32	4	7
453	 Fucking whore.	32	4	7
454	 Youre doing it wrong.	33	4	7
455	 You need to burn away that horrible bit there.	33	4	7
456	 Otherwise its gonna get infected and fester.	33	4	7
457	 I know you dont like fire, but if you dont do it right	33	4	7
458	 No fire.	33	4	7
459	 Itll only take a second.	33	4	7
460	  It wont hurt that much.  No fire!	33	4	7
461	 Shut up about it.	33	4	7
462	 Shut up about everything.	33	4	7
463	 Thanks to you, Im a walking bag of silver	33	4	7
464	 anywhere the Lannisters hold sway.	33	4	7
465	 Which is everywhere between where we are now	34	4	7
466	 and where were going.	34	4	7
467	 Im as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village,	34	4	7
468	 getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten.	34	4	7
469	 No reward is worth this much trouble.	34	4	7
470	 Wish Id never laid eyes on you.	34	4	7
471	 You say your brother gave you that sword.	34	4	7
472	 My brother gave me this.	34	4	7
473	 It was just like you said a while back.	34	4	7
474	 Pressed me to the fire	34	4	7
475	 like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.	34	4	7
476	 Why?	35	4	7
477	 Thought I stole one of his toys.	35	4	7
478	 I didnt steal it. I was just playing with it.	35	4	7
479	 The pain was bad.	35	4	7
480	 The smell was worse.	35	4	7
481	 But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it.	35	4	7
482	 My father, who protected him	35	4	7
483	 told everyone my bedding caught fire.	35	4	7
484	 You think youre on your own?	35	4	7
485	 Let me wash it out	36	4	7
486	 and help you sew it up at least.	36	4	7
487	   Bit of comfort never hurt anyone.	36	4	7
488	 Weve been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks.	36	4	7
489	 I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night	36	4	7
490	 and a hot meal not cooked by you.	36	4	7
491	 Couldnt agree more, my lady.	36	4	7
492	 Just dont start expecting silk underclothes.	36	4	7
493	 Not working for your former lord any longer.	36	4	7
494	  Yes, my lady.  Dont get drunk.	36	4	7
495	 No, my lady.	37	4	7
496	 Hot   Can I get you anything else?	37	4	7
497	 No, this will do nicely, thank you.	37	4	7
498	 Kidney pie is wonderful.	37	4	7
499	 Thanks.	37	4	7
500	 I do my best.	37	4	7
501	 A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients.	37	4	7
502	 Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk.	37	4	7
503	 Easy enough. But the meat,	37	4	7
504	 peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak	37	4	7
505	 and calves kidneys is not easy.	37	4	7
506	 I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys.	37	4	7
507	 Got no right to cook anything, them.	37	4	7
508	 Oh, and the gravy.	37	4	7
509	 Dont get me started on the gravy.	37	4	7
510	 Very difficult to get right.	37	4	7
511	 See, a lot of people give up on the gravy.	37	4	7
512	 You cannot give up on the gravy.	37	4	7
513	 No gravy, no pie.	37	4	7
514	 Simple as that.	37	4	7
515	 Thats nice armor. Are you a knight?	37	4	7
516	 No.	37	4	7
517	 Oh, its just people with armor are usually knights.	38	4	7
518	 Generally speaking. From Kings Landing, though, arent you?	38	4	7
519	 From there myself originally. Flea Bottom born and bred.	38	4	7
520	 What brings you to these parts?	38	4	7
521	 Were looking for someone.	38	4	7
522	 Someone in particular? Maybe they came in here.	38	4	7
523	 A lot of people come in here. Just the other day we had 17	38	4	7
524	 A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty.	38	4	7
525	 Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name.	38	4	7
526	 Starks?	38	4	7
527	 What, like them lot from Winterhell?	38	4	7
528	 No, aint seen anyone like that.	38	4	7
529	 I heard they was all traitors.	38	4	7
530	 Dont need no traitors in here.	38	4	7
531	 I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark.	38	4	7
532	 I swore to her Id bring her daughters home.	38	4	7
533	 Sure I cant get you a bit more kidney pie?	38	4	7
534	 What?	39	4	7
535	 Its nothing, my lady.	39	4	7
536	 You wouldnt be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.	39	4	7
537	 Dont want to offend, my lady. Truly, I dont.	39	4	7
538	 Youre not interesting enough to be offensive.	39	4	7
539	 The Lannisters want Lady Sansa.	39	4	7
540	 The Lannisters have money.	39	4	7
541	 People kill for money.	39	4	7
542	 I dont think we should be telling people	39	4	7
543	 were searching for Lady Sansa.	39	4	7
544	 My lady. My lord. Could I have a word?	39	4	7
545	 What about? Not kidney pie.	40	4	7
546	 You seem like a proper lady.	40	4	7
547	 Someone who could be trusted.	40	4	7
548	 I never met no Sansa Stark.	40	4	7
549	 But I know her sister	40	4	7
550	 Arya.	40	4	7
551	 No ones seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded.	40	4	7
552	 Shes presumed dead.	40	4	7
553	 She werent when I last spoke to her.	40	4	7
554	  When was that?  Heading up north with the Nights Watch.	40	4	7
555	 She was all dressed up as a boy.	40	4	7
556	 Like your ladyship, only without the armor.	40	4	7
557	 Going by the name Arry.	40	4	7
558	  So what happened to her?  Well	40	4	7
559	 The quick version.	40	4	7
560	 The Lannisters took us prisoner.	40	4	7
561	 We escaped.	40	4	7
562	 The Brotherhood took us prisoner.	40	4	7
563	 They sold me to the innkeep.	40	4	7
564	 They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun	40	4	7
565	 along with another prisoner.	40	4	7
566	 Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth	41	4	7
567	 and a face like a half-burnt ham.	41	4	7
568	   Not friendly.  The Hound.	41	4	7
569	 Thats the one.	41	4	7
570	 If you find her, could you give her this?	41	4	7
571	 She liked the last one I gave her,	41	4	7
572	 but, well, this one turned out better.	41	4	7
573	 Um, you were saying?	41	4	7
574	   Her mothers dead, grandfathers dead,	41	4	7
575	 Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun.	41	4	7
576	 The Brotherhood isnt going to Riverrun.	41	4	7
577	 Theyll take her to the Eyrie, my lady.	41	4	7
578	 Why the Eyrie?	41	4	7
579	 Her aunt, Lysa Arryn.	41	4	7
580	 Catelyn Starks sister.	41	4	7
581	 Shes Aryas last living relative with money.	41	4	7
582	 She hates the Lannisters.	41	4	7
583	 Lord Tyrion made sure I knew	42	4	7
584	 which house married which and who hated who.	42	4	7
585	 Sansa could be there, too.	42	4	7
586	 Aye, my lady.	42	4	7
587	 Could be.	42	4	7
588	 You sure about this?	42	4	7
589	 No.	42	4	7
590	 (door opens)	42	4	7
591	 I imagined youd be back at the brothel at this hour.	43	4	7
592	 I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.	43	4	7
593	 Mm, do tell.	43	4	7
594	 Ive got every kind of filth down here	43	4	7
595	 except the kind I like.	43	4	7
596	 Your sister.	43	4	7
597	 Oh.	43	4	7
598	 Cersei approached me.	43	4	7
599	 We spoke a great deal about her daughter.	43	4	7
600	 How worried your sister is about her.	43	4	7
601	 She was trying very hard to pretend	43	4	7
602	 she had not come to sway me against you.	43	4	7
603	 I think she may have even believed it herself.	43	4	7
604	 Making honest feelings do dishonest work	43	4	7
605	 is one of her many gifts.	44	4	7
606	 It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions.	44	4	7
607	 It is rare to meet a Lannister	44	4	7
608	 who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters.	44	4	7
609	 She desperately wants to see you killed.	44	4	7
610	 She didnt need to bother you.	44	4	7
611	 It looks as though Ive taken care of that myself.	44	4	7
612	 The joy she will feel	44	4	7
613	 when my head leaves my neck.	44	4	7
614	 Shes wanted this for a long time.	44	4	7
615	 Yes, I know.	44	4	7
616	 We met, you and I.	44	4	7
617	 Many years ago.	44	4	7
618	 I think I would have remembered that.	44	4	7
619	 Unlikely. You had just been born.	44	4	7
620	 Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him	45	4	7
621	 on a visit to Casterly Rock.	45	4	7
622	 My first time away from Dorne.	45	4	7
623	 I didnt like anything about the Rock.	45	4	7
624	 Not the food, not the weather,	45	4	7
625	 not your accents.	45	4	7
626	 Nothing.	45	4	7
627	 But the biggest disappointment	45	4	7
628	 you.	45	4	7
629	 You and my family have more in common than you might admit.	45	4	7
630	 The whole way from Dorne	45	4	7
631	 all anyone talked about was the monster	45	4	7
632	 that had been born to Tywin Lannister.	45	4	7
633	 A head twice the size of his body,	45	4	7
634	 a tail between his legs,	45	4	7
635	 claws, one red eye,	45	4	7
636	 the privates of both a girl and a boy.	45	4	7
637	 That would have made things so much easier.	45	4	7
638	 When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us.	45	4	7
639	 Every day we would ask.	46	4	7
640	 Every day she would say, Soon.	46	4	7
641	 Then she and your brother	46	4	7
642	 took us to your nursery and	46	4	7
643	 she unveiled the freak.	46	4	7
644	 Your head was a bit large.	46	4	7
645	 Your arms and legs were a bit small,	46	4	7
646	 but no claw.	46	4	7
647	 No red eye. No tail between your legs.	46	4	7
648	 Just a tiny pink cock.	46	4	7
649	 We didnt try to hide our disappointment.	46	4	7
650	 Thats not a monster, I told Cersei.	46	4	7
651	 Thats just a baby.	46	4	7
652	 And she said, He killed my mother.	46	4	7
653	 And she pinched your little cock so hard,	46	4	7
654	 I thought she might pull it off.	46	4	7
655	 Until your brother made her stop.	46	4	7
656	 It doesnt matter, she told us.	46	4	7
657	 Everyone says he will die soon.	47	4	7
658	 I hope they are right.	47	4	7
659	 He should not have lived this long.	47	4	7
660	 Well	47	4	7
661	 sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants.	47	4	7
662	 And what about what I want?	47	4	7
663	 Justice	47	4	7
664	 for my sister and her children.	47	4	7
665	 If you want justice,	47	4	7
666	 youve come to the wrong place.	47	4	7
667	 I disagree.	47	4	7
668	 Ive come to the perfect place.	47	4	7
669	 I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice.	48	4	7
670	 And all those who have wronged me are right here.	48	4	7
671	 I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane,	48	4	7
672	 who killed my sisters children	48	4	7
673	 and then raped her with their blood still on his hands	48	4	7
674	 before killing her, too.	48	4	7
675	 I will be your champion.	48	4	7
676	 (exhales)	48	4	7
677	 Hello, Robin.	49	4	7
678	 What are you doing?	49	4	7
679	 Im building my home, Winterfell.	49	4	7
680	 At least I think I am.	49	4	7
681	 I havent been back there in a very long time.	49	4	7
682	 Why did you leave?	49	4	7
683	 Its a long story.	49	4	7
684	 I stay here in the Eyrie.	50	4	7
685	 Mother says its dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe	50	4	7
686	 because Im the Lord of the Vale	50	4	7
687	 and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person.	50	4	7
688	 Yes, you certainly are.	50	4	7
689	 When will you go back?	50	4	7
690	 Probably never.	50	4	7
691	 My family doesnt live there anymore	50	4	7
692	 and someone burned it down.	50	4	7
693	 Oh.	50	4	7
694	 Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?	50	4	7
695	 No, Im afraid not.	50	4	7
696	 Its not high up in the mountains. Its down on the ground.	50	4	7
697	  That sounds dangerous.  (chuckles)	50	4	7
698	  How do you make people fly?  We dont.	50	4	7
699	 What do you do with all the bad people	50	4	7
700	 and the scary people and the people you dont like?	50	4	7
701	 I never did anything with them at all.	50	4	7
702	 Girls didnt take part in that where I came from.	50	4	7
703	 Well, Im Lord of the Vale.	50	4	7
704	 When I grow up, Ill be able to fly anybody who bothers me.	50	4	7
705	 Or you. When we get married,	51	4	7
706	 you can tell me if you dont like somebody	51	4	7
707	 and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh!	51	4	7
708	 Right through the Moon Door.	51	4	7
709	 I like the sound of that.	51	4	7
710	 Lets put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.	51	4	7
711	 All right.	51	4	7
712	 It can go in here in this big tower.	51	4	7
713	 Careful. Youve ruined it.	51	4	7
714	 Now Im going to have to rebuild the whole thing.	51	4	7
715	  I didnt ruin it.  You did.	51	4	7
716	 It was already ruined because it didnt have a Moon Door.	51	4	7
717	 I was fixing it.	51	4	7
718	 Knocking things down isnt fixing them.	51	4	7
719	  Its ruining them.  I didnt ruin it!	51	4	7
720	  Youre being stupid.  I didnt ruin it!	51	4	7
721	 (grunting)	51	4	7
722	 (gasps)	51	4	7
723	  (crying)  Robin, Im sorry, I	51	4	7
724	   Children.	51	4	7
725	   I hit him.  Yes, I saw.	52	4	7
726	 I shouldnt have done that.	52	4	7
727	 No, his mother should have	52	4	7
728	 a long time ago.	52	4	7
729	 Consider it a step in the right direction.	52	4	7
730	 If he tells Aunt Lysa	52	4	7
731	 Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.	52	4	7
732	 I was trying to remember what everything looked like.	52	4	7
733	 Ill never see it again.	52	4	7
734	 A lot can happen between now and never.	52	4	7
735	 If you want to build a better home,	52	4	7
736	 first you must demolish the old one.	52	4	7
737	 Why did you really kill Joffrey?	52	4	7
738	 Tell me why.	52	4	7
739	 I loved your mother more than you could ever know.	53	4	7
740	 Given the opportunity, what do we do to those	53	4	7
741	 whove hurt the ones we love?	53	4	7
742	 In a better world,	53	4	7
743	 one where love	53	4	7
744	 could overcome strength and duty,	53	4	7
745	 you might have been my child.	53	4	7
746	 But we dont live in that world.	53	4	7
747	 Youre more beautiful than she ever was.	53	4	7
748	 Lord Baelish	54	4	7
749	 Call me Petyr.	54	4	7
750	 (wind whistling)	54	4	7
751	 You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?	54	4	7
752	 Come here, Sansa.	54	4	7
753	 Do you know how far the fall is?	55	4	7
754	 No.	55	4	7
755	 Neither do I, precisely.	55	4	7
756	 Hundreds of feet.	55	4	7
757	 Its fascinating	55	4	7
758	 what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height.	55	4	7
759	 The impact breaks them right apart.	55	4	7
760	 Like eggs dropped on the floor.	55	4	7
761	 Sometimes pieces remain intact.	55	4	7
762	 Youll find the head sitting on its own.	55	4	7
763	 Every hair in place.	55	4	7
764	 Blue eyes staring at nothing.	55	4	7
765	 I know what you did.	55	4	7
766	 Im so sorry, Aunt Lysa.	55	4	7
767	 I never should have hit Robin, I know it. I promise it wont happen	56	4	7
768	 Dont be coy with me, you little whore.	56	4	7
769	 You kissed him. You kissed Petyr.	56	4	7
770	  I didnt. You dont understand.  I saw you.	56	4	7
771	 You cant lie to me because I saw it with my own eyes.	56	4	7
772	  He kissed me. I pulled away.  Liar!	56	4	7
773	  (whimpering)  Whore! He is mine!	56	4	7
774	 My father, my husband, my sister,	56	4	7
775	 they all stood between us and now theyre all dead.	56	4	7
776	 Thats what happens to people who stand between Petyr and me.	56	4	7
777	 Look down!	56	4	7
778	 Look down! Look down! Look down!	56	4	7
779	   Lysa!	56	4	7
780	 Let her go.	56	4	7
781	 You want her?	56	4	7
782	 This empty-headed child?	56	4	7
783	 Let her go.	56	4	7
784	 Shes just like her mother. Shell never love you.	56	4	7
785	 I lied for you.	56	4	7
786	 I killed for you.	57	4	7
787	 Why did you bring her here? Why?	57	4	7
788	 Ill send her away.	57	4	7
789	 I swear on my life.	57	4	7
790	 I swear to all the gods.	57	4	7
791	 Let her go, Lysa.	57	4	7
792	 (crying)	57	4	7
793	 (whimpering)	57	4	7
794	 (sobbing)	57	4	7
795	 Oh, my sweet wife.	57	4	7
796	 My sweet, silly wife.	57	4	7
797	 I have only loved one woman	58	4	7
798	 only one,	58	4	7
799	 my entire life.	58	4	7
800	 Your sister.	58	4	7

8	 Returning him may buy life for my children.	0	2	10
9	 A girl owes one more name. Give a man a name.	0	2	10
10	 - Jaqen H'ghar. - A girl gives a man his own name?	0	2	10
11	 I'll un-name you if you help me and my friends escape.	0	2	10
12	 A girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight.	0	2	10
13	 Who was that out there hung up at the gates?	0	2	10
14	 Must have been the farmer's boys.	0	2	10
15	 Killed them, burned them,	0	2	10
16	 and passed them off as the little lords?	0	2	10

29	 When he does, one brother inside his army	1	2	10

31	 - They'll never trust me. - They might.	1	2	10
32	 - If you do what needs to be done. - What?	1	2	10
33	 I should have known better, trusting a traitor's bastard!	1	2	10
34	 He's not yours to kill, crow.	1	2	10
35	 I don't want to marry the Frey girl.	1	2	10
36	 I don't want you to marry her.	1	2	10
37	 If you enter that place, you will never leave again.	1	2	10

55	 Would you like something for the pain?	4	2	10
56	 What happened?	4	2	10
57	 The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon	4	2	10
58	 suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of your father.	4	2	10
59	 Where am I?	4	2	10
60	 These are your new chambers.	4	2	10
61	 A little cramped, perhaps,	4	2	10
62	 but you don't need much room, do you?	4	2	10
63	 You are no longer Hand of the King.	4	2	10
64	 Oh.	4	2	10
65	 For your trouble.	5	2	10
66	 I, Joffrey of the House Baratheon, first of my name,	5	2	10
67	 the rightful King of the Andals	5	2	10
68	 and the First Men,	5	2	10
69	 Lord of the Seven Kingdoms	5	2	10
70	 and protector of the Realm,	5	2	10
71	 do hereby proclaim my grandfather	5	2	10
72	 Tywin Lannister the savior of the city	5	2	10
73	 and the Hand of the King.	5	2	10
74	 Thank you, Your Grace.	5	2	10
75	 Lord Petyr Baelish, step forward.	6	2	10
76	 For your good service and ingenuity	6	2	10
77	 in uniting the Houses of Lannister and Tyrell,	6	2	10
78	 I declare that you shall be granted the castle of Harrenhal...	6	2	10
79	 With all its attendant lands and incomes	6	2	10
80	 to be held by your sons and grandsons	6	2	10
81	 from this day until the end of time.	6	2	10
82	 You honor me beyond words, Your Grace.	6	2	10
83	 I shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons.	6	2	10
84	 Ser Loras Tyrell.	6	2	10
85	 Your House has come to our aid.	6	2	10
86	 The whole realm is in your debt,	6	2	10
87	 none more so than I.	6	2	10
88	 If your family would ask anything of me, ask it	6	2	10
89	 and it shall be yours.	6	2	10
90	 Your Grace,	6	2	10
91	 my sister Margaery,	6	2	10
92	 her husband was taken from us before...	6	2	10
93	 She remains innocent.	7	2	10
94	 I would ask you to find it in your heart	7	2	10
95	 to do us the great honor of joining our Houses.	7	2	10
96	 Is this what you want, Lady Margaery?	7	2	10
97	 With all my heart, Your Grace.	7	2	10
98	 I have come to love you from afar.	7	2	10
99	 Tales of your courage and wisdom	7	2	10
100	 have never been far from my ears.	7	2	10
101	 And those tales have taken root deep inside of me.	7	2	10
102	 Well, I too have heard tales of your beauty and grace,	7	2	10
103	 but the tales	7	2	10
104	 do not do you justice, My Lady.	7	2	10
105	 It would be an honor to return your love,	7	2	10
106	 but I am promised to another.	7	2	10
107	 A King must keep his word.	7	2	10
108	 Your Grace, in the judgment of your small council,	7	2	10
109	 it would be neither proper nor wise	7	2	10
110	 for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason,	7	2	10
111	 a girl whose brother is in open rebellion	8	2	10
112	 against the throne as we speak.	8	2	10
113	 For the good of the realm,	8	2	10
114	 your councilors beg you...	8	2	10
115	 to set Sansa Stark aside.	8	2	10
116	 - Margaery! - We want Margaery!	8	2	10
117	 I would like to heed your wishes	8	2	10
118	 and the wishes of my people,	8	2	10
119	 but I took a holy vow.	8	2	10
120	 Your Grace,	8	2	10
121	 the Gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn,	8	2	10
122	 but your father, blessed be his memory,	8	2	10
123	 made this pact before the Starks	8	2	10
124	 revealed their falseness.	8	2	10
125	 I have consulted with the High Septon	8	2	10
126	 and he assures me that their crimes against the realm	8	2	10
127	 free you from any promise you have made to them	8	2	10
128	 in the sight of the Gods.	8	2	10
129	 The Gods are good.	8	2	10
130	 I am free to heed my heart.	9	2	10
131	 Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister.	9	2	10
132	 You will be my Queen	9	2	10
133	 and I will love you from this day	9	2	10
134	 until my last day.	9	2	10
135	 My Lady.	9	2	10
136	 My sincerest condolences.	9	2	10
137	 They're right-- I'm not good enough for him.	9	2	10
138	 You shouldn't say that.	9	2	10
139	 You'll be good enough for many things.	9	2	10
140	 He'll still enjoy beating you.	9	2	10
141	 And now that you're a woman,	9	2	10
142	 he'll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well.	9	2	10
143	 But if he's not marrying me--	9	2	10
144	 He'll let you go home?	9	2	10
145	 Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys.	10	2	10
146	 You have a tender heart,	10	2	10
147	 just like your mother did at your age.	10	2	10
148	 I can see so much of her in you.	10	2	10
149	 She was like a sister to me.	10	2	10
150	 For her sake,	10	2	10
151	 I'll help get you home.	10	2	10
152	 King's Landing is my home now.	10	2	10
153	 Look around you.	10	2	10
154	 We're all liars here.	10	2	10
155	 And every one of us is better than you.	10	2	10
156	 Come in.	10	2	10
157	 Make yourself comfortable.	10	2	10
158	 That doesn't look very comfortable.	10	2	10
159	 Here, watch me.	11	2	10
160	 No need for that, my dear.	11	2	10
161	 You sure?	11	2	10
162	 Most men like what they see.	11	2	10
163	 I'm not like most men.	11	2	10
164	 That's what most men say.	11	2	10
165	 If you don't want what most men want,	11	2	10
166	 then you'd better tell me what you'd like me to do.	11	2	10
167	 I would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish	11	2	10
168	 has been all you'd hoped it would be.	11	2	10
169	 Have we met?	11	2	10
170	 You wouldn't remember me if we had?	11	2	10
171	 I meet a lot of men.	11	2	10
172	 And I think you remember all of them.	11	2	10
173	 I think your true talents are wasted on them.	11	2	10
174	 You're very kind, My Lord.	11	2	10
175	 Allow me to return the favor.	11	2	10
176	 You're afraid.	11	2	10
177	 Why? Nothing dangerous down there.	11	2	10
178	 I know who you are.	11	2	10
179	 And, unlike your current employer,	12	2	10
180	 I protect those who work for me.	12	2	10
181	 I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims	12	2	10
182	 or force them to abuse each other.	12	2	10
183	 How do you know about that?	12	2	10
184	 I thought you said you knew who I was.	12	2	10
185	 What can I do for you, Lord Varys?	12	2	10
186	 Littlefinger looks at you	12	2	10
187	 and sees a collection of profitable holes.	12	2	10
188	 I see a potential partner.	12	2	10
189	 - I'm afraid of him. - Oh, you should be.	12	2	10
190	 He's a dangerous man.	12	2	10
191	 But everyone has their weaknesses.	12	2	10
192	 Your current employer hides his very well,	12	2	10
193	 but not as well as he thinks.	12	2	10
194	 You're a virgin, I take it?	13	2	10
195	 Walk.	13	2	10
196	 Childhood must have been awful for you.	13	2	10
197	 Were you a foot taller than all the boys?	13	2	10
198	 They laughed at you, called you names?	13	2	10
199	 Some boys like a challenge.	13	2	10
200	 One or two must have tried to get inside big Brienne.	13	2	10
201	 - One or two tried. - Ah.	13	2	10
202	 But you fought them off.	13	2	10
203	 But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you,	13	2	10
204	 fling you down, tear off your clothes.	13	2	10
205	 But none of them were strong enough.	13	2	10
206	 - I'm strong enough. - Not interested.	13	2	10
207	 Of course you are.	13	2	10
208	 You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman.	13	2	10
209	" Ah. ""They lay with lions."""	13	2	10
210	 Tavern girls, I'd say.	13	2	10
211	 Probably served my father's soldiers.	13	2	10
212	 Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel.	13	2	10
213	 That's how they earned this.	13	2	10
214	 The glorious work of the northern freedom fighters.	13	2	10
215	 Must make you proud to serve the Starks.	13	2	10
216	 I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn.	13	2	10
217	 Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams.	14	2	10
218	 - What are you doing? - Burying them.	14	2	10
219	 We shouldn't stay here. We should get back on the river.	14	2	10
220	 I think these women would understand if--	14	2	10
221	 I don't care what you think.	14	2	10
222	 I didn't leave it here.	14	2	10
223	 Untie me now.	14	2	10
224	 I gave it to you to cut the rope, and now I don't	14	2	10
225	 have me dagger no more.	14	2	10
226	 So unless it got stuck in your ass on its way to your cunt,	14	2	10
227	 it stands to reason that it's gone-- whoa!	14	2	10
228	 What's your business here?	14	2	10
229	 Traveling a prisoner.	14	2	10
230	 You're a woman. A woman!	14	2	10
231	 Well, fuck me!	14	2	10
232	 If you've quite finished up--	14	2	10
233	 All right, we'll be going.	14	2	10
234	 Whoa, whoa.	14	2	10
235	 Who do you fight for?	14	2	10
236	 The Starks.	14	2	10
237	 What did he do?	14	2	10
238	 Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?	14	2	10
239	 No, stealing is a crime.	15	2	10
240	 But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you.	15	2	10
241	 - Where are you taking him? - To Riverrun.	15	2	10
242	 Why Riverrun?	15	2	10
243	 Steal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in.	15	2	10
244	 - Why not kill him? - For stealing a pig?	15	2	10
245	 I don't give the orders.	15	2	10
246	 He must be important to someone.	15	2	10
247	 Sending him with you? How important could he be?	15	2	10
248	 All right, have it your way,	15	2	10
249	 m'lady.	15	2	10
250	 - Do I know you? - Have you been to Ashemark?	15	2	10
251	 - No. - Then you don't know me.	15	2	10
252	 Do you ever go to the river market at Salt Rock?	15	2	10
253	 - Is it near Ashemark? - No.	15	2	10
254	 I've never been there.	15	2	10
255	 What do you think of these beauties?	15	2	10
256	 I hope you gave them quick deaths.	15	2	10
257	 Two of them we did, yeah.	15	2	10
258	 Wait.	15	2	10
259	 I do know you.	15	2	10
260	 That's Jaime Lannister.	15	2	10
261	 I wish someone had told me.	15	2	10
262	 I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.	16	2	10
263	 If this is the Kingslayer, I think I'd know about it.	16	2	10
264	 How do you know what the Kingslayer looks like?	16	2	10
265	 I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him.	16	2	10
266	 They dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the King.	16	2	10
267	 He's not the Kingslayer. Sorry to disappoint you.	16	2	10
268	 If he was, I'd only be traveling his head.	16	2	10
269	 I have a question for you both.	16	2	10
270	 And I want you to answer it at the same time.	16	2	10
271	 I count to three, you both answer.	16	2	10
272	 What's his name?	16	2	10
273	 One.	16	2	10
274	 Two. Three.	16	2	10
275	 Two quick deaths.	16	2	10
276	 Those were Stark men.	17	2	10
277	 I don't serve the Starks.	17	2	10
278	 I serve Lady Catelyn.	17	2	10
279	 I told her I'd take you to King's Landing,	17	2	10
280	 and that's what I'm going to do.	17	2	10
281	 Stay.	17	2	10
282	 Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.	17	2	10
283	 I know that.	17	2	10
284	 And you mean to do it anyway?	17	2	10
285	 I love her.	17	2	10
286	 I know that seems important to you.	17	2	10
287	 It is important to me.	17	2	10
288	 Your father didn't love me when we married.	18	2	10
289	 He hardly knew me or I him.	18	2	10
290	 Love didn't just happen to us.	18	2	10
291	 We built it slowly over the years,	18	2	10
292	 stone by stone,	18	2	10
293	 for you, for your brothers and sisters,	18	2	10
294	 for all of us.	18	2	10
295	 It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods,	18	2	10
296	 but it is stronger.	18	2	10
297	 It lasts longer.	18	2	10
298	 And that is what would be in store for me	18	2	10
299	 with one of Walder Frey's daughters,	18	2	10
300	 - what you and father had? - Why not?	18	2	10
301	 Because she's not beautiful?	18	2	10
302	 Because she's not exotic and exciting?	18	2	10
303	 Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it.	18	2	10
304	 And you agreed to it.	18	2	10
305	 You gave him your word.	18	2	10
306	 Treat your oaths recklessly and your people will do the same.	18	2	10
307	 If your father lived his life for one thing--	18	2	10
308	 My father is dead.	18	2	10
309	 And the only parent I have left has no right	18	2	10
310	 to call anyone reckless.	18	2	10
311	 You said you saw my victory in the flames.	19	2	10
312	 I did.	19	2	10
313	 - I still see it. - The flames lied.	19	2	10
314	 And I'm no better than a savage	19	2	10
315	 trusting in a Fire God.	19	2	10
316	 I fought for your God in Blackwater Bay.	19	2	10
317	 I led my men to the gates of the Seventh Hell	19	2	10
318	 as their brothers burned alive, and for what?	19	2	10
319	 Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells.	19	2	10
320	 If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me?	19	2	10
321	 The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.	19	2	10
322	 You claimed to speak for a God.	19	2	10
323	 Will you quit the war just because you've lost a battle?	19	2	10
324	 You talk about war as if you understand it.	19	2	10
325	 I've been fighting far longer than you.	19	2	10
326	 Have you? Show me how you fight.	19	2	10
327	 Show me.	20	2	10
328	 Where's your God now?	20	2	10
329	 Will he save you?	20	2	10
330	 Where is your God?	20	2	10
331	 Inside you.	20	2	10
332	 I murdered my brother.	20	2	10
333	 We murdered him.	20	2	10
334	 Share the weight with me.	20	2	10
335	 He wasn't your brother.	20	2	10
336	 This war has just begun.	20	2	10
337	 It will last for years.	20	2	10
338	 Thousands will die at your command.	20	2	10
339	 You will betray the men serving you.	21	2	10
340	 You will betray your family.	21	2	10
341	 You will betray everything you once held dear.	21	2	10
342	 And it will all be worth it	21	2	10
343	 because you are the Son of Fire.	21	2	10
344	 You are the Warrior of Light.	21	2	10
345	 You will sweep aside this pretender and that one.	21	2	10
346	 You will be King.	21	2	10
347	 You promise these things, but...	21	2	10
348	 you don't know.	21	2	10
349	 None of us know.	21	2	10
350	 Let me show you.	21	2	10
351	 Look into the fire, my King.	21	2	10
352	 Look.	21	2	10
353	 I see fire.	21	2	10
354	 Keep looking.	21	2	10
355	 Do you see?	22	2	10
356	 Do you see, my King?	22	2	10
357	 Yes.	22	2	10
358	 I will kill that man.	22	2	10
359	 I don't care how many arrows they feather me with,	22	2	10
360	 how many spears they run through me,	22	2	10
361	 I will kill that horn-blowing cunt before I fall.	22	2	10
362	 They want you to know you're surrounded.	22	2	10
363	 I know I'm surrounded.	22	2	10
364	 I know that because I stood on the battlements	22	2	10
365	 and saw I was surrounded.	22	2	10
366	 They don't want you to sleep.	23	2	10
367	 They want to sap your spirit before--	23	2	10
368	 Thank you, wise bald man.	23	2	10
369	 Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me.	23	2	10
370	 No word from my father?	23	2	10
371	 No.	23	2	10
372	 Send more ravens.	23	2	10
373	 You killed all the ravens.	23	2	10
374	 The first time I saw Winterfell...	23	2	10
375	 The first time I saw Winterfell,	23	2	10
376	 it looked like something that had been here for	23	2	10
377	 thousands of years	23	2	10
378	 and would be here for thousands of years	23	2	10
379	 after I was dead.	23	2	10
380	 I saw it and I thought,	23	2	10
381	" ""of course Ned Stark crushed our rebellion"	23	2	10
382	 and killed my brothers.	23	2	10
383	" We never stood a chance against a man who lives here."""	23	2	10
384	 Lord Stark went out of his way to make it your home.	23	2	10
385	 Yes, my captors were so very kind to me.	24	2	10
386	 You love reminding me of that.	24	2	10
387	 Everyone in this frozen pile of shit	24	2	10
388	 has always loved reminding me of that.	24	2	10
389	 You know what it's like to be told how lucky you are	24	2	10
390	 to be someone's prisoner?	24	2	10
391	 To be told how much you owe them?	24	2	10
392	 And then to go back home to your real father...	24	2	10
393	 I will kill that man.	24	2	10
394	 I swear it to the Drowned God,	24	2	10
395	 the Old Gods, the New Gods,	24	2	10
396	 to every fucking God in every fucking heaven,	24	2	10
397	 I will kill that man.	24	2	10
398	 Theon, listen to me.	24	2	10
399	 I serve Winterfell.	24	2	10
400	 Now Winterfell is yours.	24	2	10
401	 I'm bound by oath to serve you.	24	2	10
402	 And what's your counsel, trusted friend?	24	2	10
403	 Run.	24	2	10
404	 500 Northmen wait outside the walls.	24	2	10
405	 You have 20 men.	24	2	10
406	 You can't win.	24	2	10
407	 Wait for nightfall and run.	25	2	10
408	 There's nowhere to run.	25	2	10
409	 I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands.	25	2	10
410	 And even if I did, even if by some miracle	25	2	10
411	 I slipped through the lines and made it home,	25	2	10
412	 I'd be a coward.	25	2	10
413	 The Greyjoy who ran.	25	2	10
414	 The shame of the family.	25	2	10
415	 Don't go home.	25	2	10
416	 Join the Night's Watch.	25	2	10
417	 Once a man has taken the Black...	25	2	10
418	 he's beyond reach of the law.	25	2	10
419	 All his past crimes are forgiven.	25	2	10
420	 I won't make it to the Wall.	25	2	10
421	 I won't make it 10 feet past the Winterfell gates.	25	2	10
422	 There are ways.	25	2	10
423	 Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell	25	2	10
424	 could escape.	25	2	10
425	 The road will be dangerous.	25	2	10
426	 But with a little luck...	25	2	10
427	 the Night's Watch is an ancient, honorable order.	26	2	10
428	 You'll have opportunities there.	26	2	10
429	 The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep.	26	2	10
430	 The opportunity to make amends for what you've done.	26	2	10
431	 I've done a lot, haven't I?	26	2	10
432	 Things I never imagined myself doing.	26	2	10
433	 I've known you many years, Theon Greyjoy.	26	2	10
434	 You're not the man you're pretending to be.	26	2	10
435	 Not yet.	26	2	10
436	 You may be right.	26	2	10
437	 But I've gone too far to pretend to be anything else.	26	2	10
438	 You hear that?	27	2	10
439	 That's the mating call of the Northmen.	27	2	10
440	 They want to fuck us.	27	2	10
441	 Well, I haven't had a good fuck in weeks.	27	2	10
442	 I'm ready for one.	27	2	10
443	 They say every Ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland.	27	2	10
444	 Aye!	27	2	10
445	 - You think they're right? - Aye.	27	2	10
446	 We die today, brothers.	27	2	10
447	 We die bleeding from 100 wounds	27	2	10
448	 with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts,	27	2	10
449	 but our war cries will echo through eternity.	27	2	10
450	 They will sing about the battle of Winterfell	27	2	10
451	 until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves.	27	2	10
452	 Every man, woman, and child will know who we were	27	2	10
453	 and how long we stood.	27	2	10
454	 Aggar and Gelmarr;	27	2	10
455	 Wex and Urzen;	27	2	10
456	 Stygg and Black Lorren--	27	2	10
457	 Ironborn warriors will cry out our names	27	2	10
458	 as they leap onto the shores of Seagard and Faircastle.	27	2	10
459	 Aye!	28	2	10
460	 - Mothers will name their sons for us. - Aye!	28	2	10
461	 Girls will think of us with their lovers inside them.	28	2	10
462	 Aye!	28	2	10
463	 And whoever kills that fucking horn-blower	28	2	10
464	 will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke!	28	2	10
465	 Aye!	28	2	10
466	 - What is dead may never die! - What is dead may never die!	28	2	10
467	 Ah!	28	2	10
468	 Thought he'd never shut up.	28	2	10
469	 It was a good speech.	28	2	10
470	 Didn't want to interrupt.	28	2	10
471	 What is this?	28	2	10
472	 What are you doing?	28	2	10
473	 Let's go home.	28	2	10
474	 Come on.	28	2	10
475	 Why should I believe you?	28	2	10
476	 Why would I lie about it?	28	2	10
477	 To create strife between my sister and me.	28	2	10
478	 Where before there was nothing but love.	29	2	10
479	 Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister's orders.	29	2	10
480	 If it weren't for your Squire's bravery,	29	2	10
481	 you'd be a dead man.	29	2	10
482	 - Pod. - Yes, My Lord?	29	2	10
483	 Would it be excessive of me	29	2	10
484	 to ask you to save my life twice in a week?	29	2	10
485	 No, My Lord.	29	2	10
486	 You're a good lad.	29	2	10
487	 Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal	29	2	10
488	 Gold Cloaks outside my door at all times.	29	2	10
489	 I'm afraid your friend has been relieved	29	2	10
490	 of his command of the City Watch.	29	2	10
491	 The Gold Cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father	29	2	10
492	 or your sister.	29	2	10
493	 It varies from cloak to cloak.	29	2	10
494	 - Then my hill tribesmen. - Have gone home.	29	2	10
495	 Your father paid them quite handsomely.	29	2	10
496	 I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other	29	2	10
497	 for some time, My Lord.	29	2	10
498	 Don't want to swim too close to a drowning man?	29	2	10
499	 And I thought we were friends.	30	2	10
500	 We are.	30	2	10
501	 Podrick, would you mind?	30	2	10
502	 There are many who know that without you	30	2	10
503	 this city faced certain defeat.	30	2	10
504	 The King won't give you any honors,	30	2	10
505	 the histories won't mention you,	30	2	10
506	 but we will not forget.	30	2	10
507	 Come along now, Podrick.	30	2	10
508	 My love.	30	2	10
509	 It was good of you to come.	30	2	10
510	 Good of me?	30	2	10
511	 Of course I come.	30	2	10
512	 - I want to see you. - Believe me, you don't.	30	2	10
513	 Have you looked?	30	2	10
514	 I will be the first.	31	2	10
515	 Well?	31	2	10
516	 You are a mess.	31	2	10
517	 I'm a monster as well as a dwarf.	31	2	10
518	 You should charge me double.	31	2	10
519	 You think I'm here for money?	31	2	10
520	 That was the arrangement we made.	31	2	10
521	 I pay you and you lie to me.	31	2	10
522	 Aw, I'm a poor little rich man	31	2	10
523	 and nobody loves me, so I make jokes all the time	31	2	10
524	 and pay them to laugh.	31	2	10
525	 Fuck your money.	31	2	10
526	 Let's leave.	31	2	10
527	 - Leave? - Leave King's Landing.	31	2	10
528	 They tried to kill you. They will try again.	31	2	10
529	 Going into wars, fighting soldiers--	31	2	10
530	 you're terrible at this.	31	2	10
531	 Let's take a boat to Pentos and never come back.	32	2	10
532	 You don't belong here.	32	2	10
533	 What would we do in Pentos?	32	2	10
534	 Eat, drink,	32	2	10
535	 fuck, live.	32	2	10
536	 I want to go with you.	32	2	10
537	 So do it.	32	2	10
538	 Your father, your sister, all these bad people,	32	2	10
539	 they can't stop you.	32	2	10
540	 Forget about them. Come with me.	32	2	10
541	 I can't.	32	2	10
542	 I do belong here.	32	2	10
543	 These bad people	32	2	10
544	 are what I'm good at.	32	2	10
545	 Outtalking them, outthinking them.	32	2	10
546	 It's what I am.	32	2	10
547	 And I like it.	32	2	10
548	 I like it more than anything I've ever done.	32	2	10
549	 Are you going to leave?	32	2	10
550	 You have a shit memory.	32	2	10
551	 I am yours and you are mine.	33	2	10
552	 In the sight of the Seven,	33	2	10
553	 I hereby seal these two souls,	33	2	10
554	 binding them as one for eternity.	33	2	10
555	 Look upon one another and say the words.	33	2	10
556	 Father, smith,	33	2	10
557	 warrior, mother,	33	2	10
558	 maiden, crone, stranger...	33	2	10
559	 - I am hers and she is mine... - I am his and he is mine...	33	2	10
560	 from this day until the end of my days.	33	2	10
561	 Is this a riddle?	34	2	10
562	 Khaleesi!	35	2	10
563	 Khaleesi!	35	2	10
564	 Khaleesi!	35	2	10
565	 Are you trying to frighten me with magic tricks?	35	2	10
566	 You want me? Here I am.	35	2	10
567	 Are you afraid of a little girl?	35	2	10
568	 How did he find us?	36	2	10
569	 What are you doing here?	36	2	10
570	 Waiting for you.	36	2	10
571	 How did you know we'd come this way?	36	2	10
572	 After all the things you have seen,	36	2	10
573	 this is your question?	36	2	10
574	 How did you kill those guards?	36	2	10
575	 Was it hard?	36	2	10
576	 No harder than taking a new name if you know the way.	36	2	10
577	 Show me how. I want to be able to do it, too.	37	2	10
578	 If you would learn, you must come with me.	37	2	10
579	 Where?	37	2	10
580	 Far and away across the Narrow Sea to Braavos.	37	2	10
581	 My dancing master was from Braavos.	37	2	10
582	 To be a dancing master is a special thing,	37	2	10
583	 but to be a faceless man--	37	2	10
584	 that is something else entirely.	37	2	10
585	 A girl has many names on her lips--	37	2	10
586	 Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin Lannister,	37	2	10
587	 Ilyn Payne, the Hound.	37	2	10
588	 Names to offer up to the Red God.	37	2	10
589	 She could offer them all one by one.	37	2	10
590	 I want to.	37	2	10
591	 But I can't.	37	2	10
592	 I need to find my brother and mother.	37	2	10
593	 And my sister.	37	2	10
594	 I need to find her, too.	37	2	10
595	 Then we must part.	37	2	10
596	 A man has duties as well.	37	2	10
597	 Here.	37	2	10
598	 What is it?	37	2	10
599	 A coin of great value.	38	2	10
600	 Could it buy a horse?	38	2	10
601	 It is not meant for the buying of horses.	38	2	10
602	 Then what good is it?	38	2	10
603	 If the day comes when you must find me again,	38	2	10
604	 just give that coin to any man from Braavos	38	2	10
605	 and say these words to him,	38	2	10
606	" ""Valar Morghulis."""	38	2	10
607	 Valar Morghulis.	38	2	10
608	 Please don't go, Jaqen.	38	2	10
609	 Jaqen is dead.	38	2	10
610	 Say it again. Valar Morghulis.	38	2	10
611	 Valar Morghulis.	38	2	10
612	 Good.	38	2	10
613	 Farewell, Arya Stark.	38	2	10
614	 Osha, what are you doing?	39	2	10
615	 Tell us what medicine to get from your chambers.	40	2	10
616	 - We'll make you better. - I feel just fine.	40	2	10
617	 They burned it down. They burned everything.	40	2	10
618	 Not everything. Not you.	40	2	10
619	 But they may come back. You have to go.	40	2	10
620	 Put on your warmest clothes.	40	2	10
621	 Pack as much food as you can carry and go north.	40	2	10
622	 North's the wrong way.	40	2	10
623	 Their mother and brother are south.	40	2	10
624	 We don't know where.	40	2	10
625	 There are too many enemies in the South.	41	2	10
626	 Go to the Wall to Jon.	41	2	10
627	 He'll look after you and let your mother know you're safe.	41	2	10
628	 I don't want to leave you.	41	2	10
629	 No more than I want to leave you.	41	2	10
630	 I pulled you into the world.	41	2	10
631	 Both of you.	41	2	10
632	 I've seen both your faces almost every day since.	41	2	10
633	 And for that, I consider myself very, very lucky.	41	2	10
634	 Go now with Hodor.	41	2	10
635	 Go on.	41	2	10
636	 I'll be right here.	41	2	10
637	 Hodor.	41	2	10
638	 Osha.	41	2	10
639	 You must protect them.	41	2	10
640	 You're the only one who can.	41	2	10
641	 You may have to protect them against your own kind.	41	2	10
642	 I've got no great love for my own kind.	41	2	10
643	 I'll get you milk of the poppy.	41	2	10
644	 Tell me where to find it.	41	2	10
645	 I don't want milk of the poppy.	42	2	10
646	 Do it quickly.	42	2	10
647	 Until the sun rises in the west	47	2	10
648	 and sets in the east,	47	2	10
649	 until the rivers run dry	47	2	10
650	 and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.	47	2	10
651	 They miss their mother.	48	2	10
652	 They want to be with you.	48	2	10
653	 Do you want to be with them?	48	2	10
654	 You will be.	48	2	10
655	 When your dragons were born,	48	2	10
656	 our magic was born again.	48	2	10
657	 It is strongest in their presence.	48	2	10
658	 And they are strongest in yours.	48	2	10
659	 You will be with them,	48	2	10
660	 through winter, summer,	48	2	10
661	 and winter again.	48	2	10
662	 Across a thousand thousand seasons	49	2	10
663	 you will be with them.	49	2	10
664	 And we will be with you until time comes to an end.	49	2	10
665	 Welcome home, Daenerys Stormborn.	49	2	10
666	 This is not my home.	49	2	10
667	 My home is across the sea	49	2	10
668	 where my people are waiting for me.	49	2	10
669	 They will be waiting a long time.	49	2	10
670	 Dracarys.	49	2	10
671	 We should be there by sundown.	50	2	10
672	 Won't be a fun night for you.	50	2	10
673	 Mance knows how to make crows sing.	50	2	10
674	 If you know what to say, you might just make it	50	2	10
675	 through the night.	50	2	10
676	 Not talking's not the way to go.	50	2	10
677	 Careful with that.	50	2	10
678	 You might cut yourself.	50	2	10
679	 Never swung a sword before, have you?	50	2	10
680	 You look like a baby with a rattle.	50	2	10
681	 Enough of that!	50	2	10
682	 - Stop! - Why, traitor?	51	2	10
683	 So you can give Mance Rayder an invitation to Castle Black?	51	2	10
684	 Let 'em fight.	51	2	10
685	 That's it? That's what you can do?	51	2	10
686	 You little shit.	51	2	10
687	 Your traitor father teach you that?	51	2	10
688	 Or was it your whore mother?	51	2	10
689	 We are the Watchers on the Wall.	52	2	10
690	 You can tell Mance	52	2	10
691	 that's the man who killed Qhorin Halfhand.	52	2	10
692	 - Burn the body. - Aye.	52	2	10
693	 You don't want this one coming back for you.	52	2	10
694	 Come along, Jon Snow.	52	2	10
695	 Time to meet the King-Beyond-The-Wall.	53	2	10
696	 What the--?	54	2	10
697	 Khaleesi, please.	54	2	10
698	 He said you'd never leave Qarth alive.	54	2	10
699	 Come.	54	2	10
700	 Nothing.	54	2	10
701	 Thank you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos.	54	2	10
702	 Thank you for teaching me this lesson.	55	2	10
703	 I am King of Qarth.	55	2	10
704	 I can help you now, truly help you.	55	2	10
705	 We can take the Iron Throne.	55	2	10
706	 - I'll bring you 1,000 ships. - Please, Khaleesi, I beg you.	55	2	10
707	 All that you have dreamed is within your reach!	55	2	10
708	 I beg you, please!	55	2	10
709	 - Khaleesi. - Please! Please!	55	2	10
710	 - Khaleesi!	55	2	10
711	 It's all a lie.	55	2	10
712	 Looks real enough to me.	55	2	10
713	 Real enough to buy a ship?	55	2	10
714	 Aye, a small ship.	55	2	10
715	 I thought we were coming north to fight wildlings.	56	2	10
716	 Is this goat?	56	2	10
717	 It's moose.	56	2	10
718	 People shouldn't live anywhere	56	2	10
719	 you need to burn shit to keep warm.	56	2	10
720	 Well, you see a tree, let me know.	56	2	10
721	 If you step back and think about it,	56	2	10
722	 the thing about Gilly that's so interesting is--	57	2	10
723	 - Just bloody kill me. - No, truly.	57	2	10
724	 The thing about her that I find so interesting is that	57	2	10
725	 after all that Craster's done to her,	57	2	10
726	 she's still got hope that life might get better.	57	2	10
727	 The thing about Gilly that you find so interesting	57	2	10
728	 is that she said six words to you.	57	2	10
729	 And the thing about you that I find so interesting	57	2	10
730	 is absolutely nothing.	57	2	10
731	 It's Jon and the Halfhand.	57	2	10
732	 They're back.	57	2	10
733	 Two blasts is wildlings.	57	2	10
734	 You're not fighting them alone. Come on.	57	2	10
735	 Three blasts?	57	2	10
736	 Run!	57	2	10
737	 Wait! Wait for me!	57	2	10
738	 Grenn!	57	2	10

11	 I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this.	3	1	1
12	 I never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life.	3	1	1
13	 - ( Horse snorts ) - How close did you get?	3	1	1
14	 - Close as any man would. - We should head back to the wall.	3	1	1
15	 Do the dead frighten you?	3	1	1
16	 Our orders were to track the wildlings.	3	1	1
17	 We tracked them. They won't trouble us no more.	3	1	1

84	 ( Muttering ) White walkers.	11	1	1

86	 White walkers.	12	1	1
87	 The white walkers, I saw them.	12	1	1
88	 ( Pants )	12	1	1
89	 I know I broke my oath.	12	1	1
90	 And I know I'm a deserter.	12	1	1
91	 I should have gone back to the wall and warned them, but...	12	1	1
92	 I saw what I saw.	12	1	1
93	 I saw the white walkers.	12	1	1
94	 People need to know.	12	1	1
95	 If you can get word to my family...	12	1	1
96	 Tell them I'm no coward.	12	1	1

98	 ( Whispers ) Forgive me, lord.	12	1	1
99	 In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon,	13	1	1
100	 - the first of his name... - Don't look away.	13	1	1
101	 - ...King of the Andals and the First Men... - Father will know if you do.	13	1	1
102	 ...Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm,	13	1	1
103	 I, Eddard of the House Stark,	13	1	1
104	 Lord of Winterfell and warden of the north,	13	1	1
105	 sentence you to die.	13	1	1
106	 You did well.	13	1	1
107	 You understand why I did it?	14	1	1
108	 Jon said he was a deserter.	14	1	1
109	 But do you understand why I had to kill him?	14	1	1
110	" ""Our way is the old way""?"	14	1	1
111	 The man who passes the sentence	14	1	1
112	 should swing the sword.	14	1	1
113	 Is it true he saw the white walkers?	14	1	1
114	 The white walkers have been gone for thousands of years.	14	1	1
115	 So he was lying?	14	1	1
116	 A madman sees what he sees.	14	1	1
117	 What is it?	15	1	1
118	 Mountain lion?	15	1	1
119	 There are no mountain lions in these woods.	15	1	1
120	 ( Pup whines )	15	1	1
121	 ( Yips )	15	1	1
122	 It's a freak!	15	1	1
123	 It's a direwolf.	16	1	1
124	 Tough old beast.	16	1	1
125	 There are no direwolves south of the wall.	16	1	1
126	 Now there are five.	16	1	1
127	 You want to hold it?	16	1	1
128	 ( Pup whimpers )	16	1	1
129	  Where will they go?	16	1	1
130	 Their mother's dead.	16	1	1
131	 They don't belong down here.	16	1	1
132	 Better a quick death.	16	1	1
133	 They won't last without their mother.	16	1	1
134	 - Right. Give it here. - No!	16	1	1
135	 - ( Whimpers ) - Put away your blade.	16	1	1
136	 I take orders from your father, not you.	16	1	1
137	 - Please, father! - I'm sorry, Bran.	16	1	1
138	 Lord Stark?	16	1	1
139	 There are five pups...	16	1	1
140	 One for each of the Stark children.	16	1	1
141	 - ( Pup cries ) - The direwolf is the sigil of your house.	16	1	1
142	 They were meant to have them.	16	1	1
143	 You will train them yourselves.	17	1	1
144	 You will feed them yourselves.	17	1	1
145	 And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.	17	1	1
146	 What about you?	17	1	1
147	 I'm not a Stark.	17	1	1
148	 Get on.	17	1	1
149	 ( Whimpers )	17	1	1
150	 What is it?	17	1	1
151	 The runt of the litter... That one's yours, Snow.	17	1	1
152	 ( Bells tolling )	17	1	1
153	 As your brother, I feel it's my duty to warn you:	18	1	1
154	 you worry too much.	18	1	1
155	 - It's starting to show. - And you never worry about anything.	18	1	1
156	 When we were seven and you jumped off the cliffs at Casterly Rock,	18	1	1
157	 100-foot drop into the water,	19	1	1
158	 and you were never afraid.	19	1	1
159	 There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father.	19	1	1
160	" ( Whispers, mimicking ) ""We're Lannisters."	19	1	1
161	" Lannisters don't act like fools."""	19	1	1
162	 What if Jon Arryn told someone?	19	1	1
163	 But who would he tell?	19	1	1
164	 - My husband. - If he told the king, both our heads	19	1	1
165	 would be skewered on the city gates by now.	19	1	1
166	 Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him.	19	1	1
167	 And Robert will choose a new Hand of the King... someone to do his job	19	1	1
168	 while he's off fucking boars and hunting whores...	19	1	1
169	 Or is it the other way around?	19	1	1
170	 And life will go on.	19	1	1
171	 You should be the Hand of the King.	19	1	1
172	 That's an honor I can do without.	19	1	1
173	 Their days are too long,	19	1	1
174	 their lives are too short.	19	1	1
175	 ( Thunder rumbles )	19	1	1
176	 ( Caws )	20	1	1
177	 ( Birds chirping )	20	1	1
178	 All these years	20	1	1
179	 and I still feel like an outsider	20	1	1
180	 when I come here.	20	1	1
181	 You have five northern children.	20	1	1
182	 You're not an outsider.	20	1	1
183	 I wonder if the old gods agree.	20	1	1
184	 It's your gods with all the rules.	20	1	1
185	 I am so sorry, my love.	20	1	1
186	 - Tell me. - There was a raven from King's Landing.	20	1	1
187	 Jon Arryn is dead.	21	1	1
188	 A fever took him.	21	1	1
189	 I know he was like a father to you.	21	1	1
190	 - Your sister, the boy? - They both have their health,	21	1	1
191	 gods be good.	21	1	1
192	 The raven brought more news...	21	1	1
193	 The king rides for Winterfell...	21	1	1
194	 With the queen	21	1	1
195	 and all the rest of them.	21	1	1
196	 If he's coming this far north...	21	1	1
197	 There's only one thing he's after.	21	1	1
198	 You can always say no, Ned.	21	1	1
199	  We'll need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber.	21	1	1
200	 I'm told he reads all night.	21	1	1
201	 I'm told he drinks all night.	22	1	1
202	 How much could he possibly drink? A man of his...	22	1	1
203	 Stature?	22	1	1
204	 We've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar.	22	1	1
205	 - Perhaps we'll find out. - In any case,	22	1	1
206	 candles.	22	1	1
207	 Why is your mother so dead set on us getting pretty for the king?	22	1	1
208	 It's for the queen, I bet. I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.	22	1	1
209	 I hear the prince is a right royal prick.	22	1	1
210	 Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab	22	1	1
211	 with his right royal prick.	22	1	1
212	 Go on, Tommy, shear him good.	22	1	1
213	 He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.	22	1	1
214	 ( Laughter )	22	1	1
215	 - ( Pup barks ) - Gods, but they grow fast.	23	1	1
216	 Brandon!	23	1	1
217	 I saw the king. He's got hundreds of people.	23	1	1
218	 How many times have I told you no climbing?	23	1	1
219	 But he's coming right now... down our road.	23	1	1
220	 I want you to promise me,	23	1	1
221	 no more climbing.	23	1	1
222	 I promise.	23	1	1
223	 - Do you know what? - What?	23	1	1
224	 You always look at your feet before you lie.	23	1	1
225	 ( Chuckles )	23	1	1
226	 Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.	23	1	1
227	 Where's Arya? Sansa, where's your sister?	24	1	1
228	 - Hey hey hey hey. - Ohh.	24	1	1
229	 What are you doing with that on?	24	1	1
230	 - Go on. - ( Arya groans )	25	1	1
231	 Move!	25	1	1
232	 ( Neighs )	25	1	1
233	 Your Grace.	26	1	1
234	 You've got fat.	26	1	1
235	 ( Laughter )	26	1	1
236	 - Cat! - Your Grace.	26	1	1
237	 Nine years... Why haven't I seen you? Where the hell have you been?	26	1	1
238	 Guarding the north for you, Your Grace.	26	1	1
239	 Winterfell is yours.	27	1	1
240	 - Where's the Imp? - Will you shut up?	27	1	1
241	  Who have we here?	27	1	1
242	 You must be Robb.	27	1	1
243	 My, you're a pretty one.	27	1	1
244	 Your name is?	27	1	1
245	 Arya.	27	1	1
246	 Oh, show us your muscles.	27	1	1
247	 You'll be a soldier.	27	1	1
248	  That's Jaime Lannister, the queen's twin brother.	27	1	1
249	  Would you please shut up?	27	1	1
250	 My queen.	27	1	1
251	 My queen.	27	1	1
252	 Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.	27	1	1
253	 We've been riding for a month, my love.	27	1	1
254	 Surely the dead can wait.	27	1	1
255	 Ned.	27	1	1
256	 Where's the Imp?	28	1	1
257	 Where is our brother?	28	1	1
258	 Go and find the little beast.	28	1	1
259	 Tell me about Jon Arryn.	28	1	1
260	 One minute he was fine and then...	28	1	1
261	 Burned right through him, whatever it was.	28	1	1
262	 I loved that man.	28	1	1
263	 We both did.	28	1	1
264	  He never had to teach you much, but me?	28	1	1
265	 You remember me at 16?	28	1	1
266	 - ( Chuckles ) - All I wanted to do	28	1	1
267	 was crack skulls and fuck girls.	28	1	1
268	 - He showed me what was what. - Aye.	28	1	1
269	 Don't look at me like that. It's not his fault I didn't listen.	28	1	1
270	 I need you, Ned...	28	1	1
271	 down at King's Landing, not up here where you're no damn use to anybody.	28	1	1
272	 Lord Eddard Stark,	28	1	1
273	 I would name you the Hand of the King.	29	1	1
274	 I'm not worthy of the honor.	29	1	1
275	 I'm not trying to honor you. I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom	29	1	1
276	 while I eat, drink and whore my way to an early grave.	29	1	1
277	 Damn it, Ned, stand up.	29	1	1
278	 You helped me win the Iron Throne,	29	1	1
279	 now help me keep the damn thing.	29	1	1
280	 We were meant to rule together.	29	1	1
281	 If your sister had lived, we'd have been bound by blood.	29	1	1
282	 Well, it's not too late.	29	1	1
283	 I have a son, you have a daughter.	29	1	1
284	 We'll join our houses.	29	1	1
285	 ( Woman moaning )	29	1	1
286	 ( Moaning )	29	1	1
287	 It is true what they say about the northern girls.	30	1	1
288	 ( Giggles )	30	1	1
289	 Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?	30	1	1
290	 I did hear something about that.	30	1	1
291	 And the queen and her twin brother.	30	1	1
292	 They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.	30	1	1
293	 And the other brother?	30	1	1
294	 - The queen has two brothers? - There's the pretty one,	30	1	1
295	 and there's the clever one.	30	1	1
296	 Mmm, I hear they call him the Imp.	30	1	1
297	 I hear he hates that nickname.	30	1	1
298	 Oh? I hear he's more than earned it.	30	1	1
299	 I hear he's a drunken little lecher,	30	1	1
300	 prone to all manner of perversions.	30	1	1
301	 Clever girl.	30	1	1
302	 We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.	30	1	1
303	 Have you?	30	1	1
304	 - Oh! - Already?	30	1	1
305	 The gods gave me one blessing.	31	1	1
306	 ( Door opens )	31	1	1
307	 - Don't get up. - My lord.	31	1	1
308	 Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door	31	1	1
309	 - in a whorehouse, brother? - You have much to teach me, no doubt,	31	1	1
310	 but our sister craves your attention.	31	1	1
311	 She has odd cravings, our sister.	31	1	1
312	 A family trait.	31	1	1
313	 Now the Starks are feasting us at sundown.	31	1	1
314	 Don't leave me alone with these people.	31	1	1
315	 I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early.	31	1	1
316	 And this is the first of many courses.	31	1	1
317	 I thought you might say that.	31	1	1
318	 But since we're short on time...	31	1	1
319	 Come on, girls.	31	1	1
320	 ( Giggling )	31	1	1
321	 See you at sundown.	31	1	1
322	  Close the door!	31	1	1
323	 Did you have to bury her in a place like this?	32	1	1
324	 She should be on a hill somewhere	32	1	1
325	 with the sun and the clouds above her.	32	1	1
326	 She was my sister.	32	1	1
327	 This is where she belongs.	32	1	1
328	 She belonged with me.	32	1	1
329	 In my dreams, I kill him every night.	32	1	1
330	 It's done, Your Grace.	32	1	1
331	 The Targaryens are gone.	32	1	1
332	 Not all of them.	32	1	1
333	 ( Gull cawing )	32	1	1
334	  Daenerys!	32	1	1
335	 Daenerys.	32	1	1
336	 There's our bride-to-be.	32	1	1
337	 Look, a gift from Illyrio.	33	1	1
338	 Touch it.	33	1	1
339	 Go on, feel the fabric.	33	1	1
340	 Mmm.	33	1	1
341	 Isn't he a gracious host?	33	1	1
342	 We've been his guests for over a year	33	1	1
343	 and he's never asked us for anything.	33	1	1
344	 Illyrio's no fool.	33	1	1
345	 He knows I won't forget my friends	33	1	1
346	 when I come into my throne.	33	1	1
347	 You still slouch.	33	1	1
348	 Let them see.	33	1	1
349	 You have a woman's body now.	33	1	1
350	 ( Sighs )	33	1	1
351	 I need you to be perfect today.	34	1	1
352	 Can you do that for me?	34	1	1
353	 You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?	34	1	1
354	 No.	34	1	1
355	 When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister,	34	1	1
356	 they will say it began today.	34	1	1
357	 It's too hot, my lady.	34	1	1
358	 ( Gulls cawing )	35	1	1
359	 Where is he?	35	1	1
360	 The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.	35	1	1
361	 ( Illyrio speaking Dothraki ) Athchomar chomakaan, Khal vezhven.	35	1	1
362	 May I present my honored guests?	35	1	1
363	 Viserys of House Targaryen,	35	1	1
364	 the third of his name,	35	1	1
365	 the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men,	35	1	1
366	 and his sister	35	1	1
367	 Daenerys of House Targaryen.	35	1	1
368	 ( Speaking Dothraki )	35	1	1
369	 Do you see how long his hair is?	36	1	1
370	 When Dothraki are defeated in combat,	36	1	1
371	 they cut off their braids so the whole world can see their shame.	36	1	1
372	 Khal Drogo has never been defeated.	36	1	1
373	 He's a savage, of course,	36	1	1
374	 but one of the finest killers alive.	36	1	1
375	 And you will be his queen.	36	1	1
376	 Come forward, my dear.	36	1	1
377	 Where is he going?!	37	1	1
378	 - The ceremony is over. - But he didn't say anything.	37	1	1
379	 - Did he like her? - Trust me, Your Grace,	37	1	1
380	 if he didn't like her, we'd know.	37	1	1
381	 It won't be long now.	37	1	1
382	 Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea	37	1	1
383	 and take back your father's throne.	37	1	1
384	 The people drink secret toasts	37	1	1
385	 to your health.	37	1	1
386	 They cry out for their true king.	37	1	1
387	 When will they be married?	37	1	1
388	 Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.	37	1	1
389	 Is it true they lie with their horses?	37	1	1
390	 I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.	37	1	1
391	 Do you take me for a fool?	37	1	1
392	 I take you for a king.	37	1	1
393	 Kings lack the caution of common men.	37	1	1
394	 My apologies if I've given offense.	37	1	1
395	 I know how to play a man like Drogo.	37	1	1
396	 I give him a queen and he gives me an army.	37	1	1
397	 I don't want to be his queen.	37	1	1
398	 I want to go home.	38	1	1
399	 So do I.	38	1	1
400	 I want us both to go home,	38	1	1
401	 but they took it from us.	38	1	1
402	 So tell me, sweet sister,	38	1	1
403	 how do we go home?	38	1	1
404	 I don't know.	38	1	1
405	 We go home with an army.	38	1	1
406	 With Khal Drogo's army.	38	1	1
407	 I would let his whole tribe fuck you...	38	1	1
408	 All 40,000 men and their horses too	38	1	1
409	 if that's what it took.	38	1	1
410	 ( Kisses )	38	1	1
411	 Do you think Joffrey will like me?	38	1	1
412	 What if he thinks I'm ugly?	38	1	1
413	 Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.	39	1	1
414	 He's so handsome.	39	1	1
415	 When would we be married? Soon? Or do we have to wait?	39	1	1
416	 Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.	39	1	1
417	 Why would he say no?	39	1	1
418	 He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.	39	1	1
419	 He'd have to leave home.	39	1	1
420	 He'd have to leave me.	39	1	1
421	 And so would you.	39	1	1
422	 You left your home to come here.	39	1	1
423	 And I'd be queen someday.	39	1	1
424	 Please make father say yes!	39	1	1
425	 - Sansa... - Please please!	39	1	1
426	 It's the only thing I ever wanted.	39	1	1
427	 ( Music playing, people chattering )	39	1	1
428	 ( Laughter )	39	1	1
429	 Fill that up! Boys, Rodrik, come on.	39	1	1
430	 Come on!	39	1	1
431	 Is he dead yet?	40	1	1
432	 Uncle Benjen.	40	1	1
433	 ( Laughs )	40	1	1
434	 You got bigger.	40	1	1
435	 Rode all day. Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters.	40	1	1
436	 Why aren't you at the feast?	40	1	1
437	 Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family	40	1	1
438	 to seat a bastard in their midst.	40	1	1
439	 Well, you're always welcome on the wall.	40	1	1
440	 No bastard was ever refused a seat there.	40	1	1
441	 So take me with you when you go back.	40	1	1
442	 - Jon... - Father will let me if you ask him.	40	1	1
443	 I know he will.	40	1	1
444	 The wall isn't going anywhere.	40	1	1
445	 I'm ready	40	1	1
446	 to swear your oath.	40	1	1
447	 You don't understand what you'd be giving up.	41	1	1
448	 We have no families.	41	1	1
449	 - None of us will ever father sons... - I don't care about that!	41	1	1
450	 You might, if you knew what it meant.	41	1	1
451	 ( Rattles )	41	1	1
452	 I'd better get inside,	41	1	1
453	 rescue your father from his guests.	41	1	1
454	 We'll talk later.	41	1	1
455	  Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.	41	1	1
456	 What are you doing back there?	41	1	1
457	 Preparing for a night with your family.	41	1	1
458	 I've always wanted to see the wall.	41	1	1
459	 You're Tyrion Lannister,	41	1	1
460	 the queen's brother?	41	1	1
461	 My greatest accomplishment.	41	1	1
462	 And you... you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?	41	1	1
463	 Did I offend you? Sorry.	42	1	1
464	 You are the bastard though.	42	1	1
465	 Lord Eddard Stark is my father.	42	1	1
466	 And Lady Stark is not your mother,	42	1	1
467	 making you the bastard.	42	1	1
468	 Let me give you some advice, bastard.	42	1	1
469	 Never forget what you are.	42	1	1
470	 The rest of the world will not.	42	1	1
471	 Wear it like armor	42	1	1
472	 and it can never be used to hurt you.	42	1	1
473	 What the hell do you know about being a bastard?	42	1	1
474	 All dwarves are bastards in their father's eyes.	42	1	1
475	 ( Music playing, chattering )	42	1	1
476	 You at a feast... It's like a bear in a trap.	43	1	1
477	 The boy I beheaded...	43	1	1
478	 - Did you know him? - Of course I did.	43	1	1
479	 Just a lad.	43	1	1
480	 And he was tough, Ned,	43	1	1
481	 a true ranger.	43	1	1
482	 Pfft. He was talking madness.	43	1	1
483	 Said the walkers slaughtered his friends.	43	1	1
484	 The two he was with are still missing.	43	1	1
485	 Hmph. A wildling ambush.	43	1	1
486	 Maybe.	43	1	1
487	 Direwolves south of the wall,	43	1	1
488	 talk of the walkers,	43	1	1
489	 and my brother might be the next Hand of the King.	43	1	1
490	 Winter is coming.	43	1	1
491	 Winter is coming.	43	1	1
492	 ( Chuckles )	43	1	1
493	 - Uncle Benjen. - Robb boy.	43	1	1
494	 - How are you? - I'm good.	43	1	1
495	 ( Laughter )	43	1	1
496	 Is this your first time in the north, Your Grace?	44	1	1
497	 Yes. Lovely country.	44	1	1
498	 I'm sure it's very grim after King's Landing.	44	1	1
499	 I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me	44	1	1
500	 up here for the first time.	44	1	1
501	 Hello, little dove.	44	1	1
502	 But you are a beauty.	44	1	1
503	 - How old are you? - 13, Your Grace.	44	1	1
504	 You're tall. Still growing?	44	1	1
505	 I think so, Your Grace.	44	1	1
506	 And have you bled yet?	44	1	1
507	 No, Your Grace.	44	1	1
508	 Your dress, did you make it?	44	1	1
509	 Such a talent. You must make something for me.	44	1	1
510	 I hear we might share a grandchild someday.	44	1	1
511	 I hear the same.	44	1	1
512	 Your daughter will do well in the Capital.	44	1	1
513	 Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.	45	1	1
514	 - Your pardon. - I hear we might be neighbors soon.	45	1	1
515	 - I hope it's true. - Yes,	45	1	1
516	 the king has honored me with his offer.	45	1	1
517	 I'm sure we'll have a tournament	45	1	1
518	 to celebrate your new title... if you accept.	45	1	1
519	 It would be good to have you on the field.	45	1	1
520	 The competition has become a bit stale.	45	1	1
521	 - I don't fight in tournaments. - No?	45	1	1
522	 Getting a little old for it?	45	1	1
523	 ( Chuckles ) I don't fight in tournaments	45	1	1
524	 because when I fight a man for real	45	1	1
525	 I don't want him to know what I can do.	45	1	1
526	 Well said.	45	1	1
527	 - ( Men laughing ) - Arya!	45	1	1
528	 It's not funny!	45	1	1
529	 She always does this.	45	1	1
530	 This was my favorite dress.	45	1	1
531	 She always does it and it's not funny!	46	1	1
532	  Time for bed.	46	1	1
533	 ( Groans )	46	1	1
534	  I'm a Northman.	46	1	1
535	 I belong here with you, not down south	46	1	1
536	 in that rats' nest they call a Capital.	46	1	1
537	 I won't let him take you.	46	1	1
538	 The king takes what he wants.	46	1	1
539	 ( Huffs ) That's why he's king.	46	1	1
540	" I'll say, ""Listen, fat man."""	46	1	1
541	 ( Laughs )	46	1	1
542	" ""You are not taking my husband anywhere."	46	1	1
543	" He belongs to me now."""	46	1	1
544	 How did he get so fat?	46	1	1
545	 He only stops eating when it's time for a drink.	46	1	1
546	 ( Knocks )	46	1	1
547	  It's Maester Luwin, my lord.	46	1	1
548	 Send him in.	47	1	1
549	 Pardon, my lord, my lady.	47	1	1
550	 A rider in the night...	47	1	1
551	 From your sister.	47	1	1
552	 - Stay. - This was sent from the Eyrie.	47	1	1
553	 ( Door closes )	47	1	1
554	 What's she doing at the Eyrie?	47	1	1
555	 She hasn't been back there since her wedding.	47	1	1
556	 What news?	47	1	1
557	 She's fled the Capital.	47	1	1
558	 She says Jon Arryn was murdered.	47	1	1
559	 By the Lannisters.	47	1	1
560	 She says the king is in danger.	47	1	1
561	 She's fresh widowed, Cat.	47	1	1
562	 She doesn't know what she's saying.	48	1	1
563	 Lysa's head would be on a spike right now	48	1	1
564	 if the wrong people had found that letter.	48	1	1
565	 Do you think she would risk her life...	48	1	1
566	 her son's life...	48	1	1
567	 if she wasn't certain her husband was murdered?	48	1	1
568	 If this news is true	48	1	1
569	 and the Lannisters conspire against the Throne,	48	1	1
570	 who but you can protect the king?	48	1	1
571	 They murdered the last Hand.	48	1	1
572	 Now you want Ned to take the job?	48	1	1
573	 The king rode for a month	48	1	1
574	 to ask for Lord Stark's help.	48	1	1
575	 He's the only one he trusts.	48	1	1
576	 You swore the king an oath, my lord.	48	1	1
577	 He's spent half his life fighting Robert's wars.	48	1	1
578	 He owes him nothing.	48	1	1
579	 Your father and brother rode south once	48	1	1
580	 on a king's demand.	48	1	1
581	 A different time.	49	1	1
582	 A different king.	49	1	1
583	 ( Drumming, clamoring )	49	1	1
584	 ( Hissing )	49	1	1
585	 ( Gasps )	49	1	1
586	 ( Jeering calls, drumming continues )	49	1	1
587	 When do I meet with the Khal?	50	1	1
588	 We need to begin planning the invasion.	50	1	1
589	 If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown,	50	1	1
590	 - you shall have it. - When?	50	1	1
591	 When their omens favor war.	50	1	1
592	 I piss on Dothraki omens.	50	1	1
593	 I've waited 17 years to get my throne back.	50	1	1
594	 - ( Crowd ululating ) - ( Grunting )	50	1	1
595	 ( Cheering )	50	1	1
596	 ( Blades clang )	51	1	1
597	 ( Screams )	51	1	1
598	 A Dothraki wedding	51	1	1
599	 without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.	51	1	1
600	 ( Laughing )	51	1	1
601	 Jadi, zhey Jorah Andahli!	51	1	1
602	 Khal vezhven.	51	1	1
603	 A small gift, for the new khaleesi...	51	1	1
604	 Songs and Histories from the Seven Kingdoms.	51	1	1
605	 Thank you, ser.	51	1	1
606	 Are you from my country?	51	1	1
607	 Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.	52	1	1
608	 I served your father for many years.	52	1	1
609	 Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king.	52	1	1
610	  Dragon's eggs, Daenerys,	52	1	1
611	 from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai.	52	1	1
612	 The ages have turned them to stone,	52	1	1
613	 but they will always be beautiful.	52	1	1
614	 Thank you, magister.	52	1	1
615	 She's beautiful.	53	1	1
616	 Ser Jorah, I don't know how to say	54	1	1
617	 thank you in Dothraki.	54	1	1
618	 There is no word for thank you in Dothraki.	54	1	1
619	 Make him happy.	54	1	1
620	 ( Waves crashing )	54	1	1
621	 - No. - ( Sobs )	55	1	1
622	 Do you know the common tongue?	55	1	1
623	 - ( Pin clanks ) - No.	55	1	1
624	" Is ""no"" the only word that you know?"	55	1	1
625	 No.	55	1	1
626	 ( Sobbing continues )	55	1	1
627	 Rough night, Imp?	56	1	1
628	 If I get through this without squirting	56	1	1
629	 from one end or the other it'll be a miracle.	56	1	1
630	 I didn't pick you for a hunter.	56	1	1
631	 The greatest in the land... my spear never misses.	56	1	1
632	 It's not hunting if you pay for it.	56	1	1
633	 Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?	56	1	1
634	 No, but I'm still better than you.	56	1	1
635	 ( Laughs )	56	1	1
636	 I know what I'm putting you through.	56	1	1
637	 Thank you for saying yes.	56	1	1
638	 I only ask you because I need you.	56	1	1
639	 You're a loyal friend.	57	1	1
640	 You hear me? A loyal friend.	57	1	1
641	 The last one I've got.	57	1	1
642	 - I hope I'll serve you well. - You will.	57	1	1
643	 And I'll make sure you don't look so fucking grim all the time.	57	1	1
644	 Come on, boys, let's go kill some boar!	57	1	1
645	 Come on, you.	57	1	1

651	 ( Grunting, moaning )	58	1	1
652	 ( Gasps ) Stop!	58	1	1
653	 - Stop. - ( Gasps )	58	1	1
654	 Are you completely mad?	58	1	1
655	 - He saw us. - It's all right, it's all right.	58	1	1
656	 - It's all right. - He saw us!	58	1	1
657	 I heard you the first time.	59	1	1
658	 ( Whimpers )	59	1	1
659	 Quite the little climber, aren't you?	59	1	1
660	 - How old are you, boy? - 10.	59	1	1
661	 10.	59	1	1
662	 The things I do for love.	59	1	1
