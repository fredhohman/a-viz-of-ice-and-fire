566	00:43:54,215	00:43:56,683	$I am touched by your$concern, Your Grace.
567	00:43:56,718	00:43:59,920	$Luckily for us Tyrells,$our blood runs quite warm.
568	00:43:59,954	00:44:01,922	$- <i>Doesn't it, Loras?</i>$- Yes.
569	00:44:01,956	00:44:05,059	$Loras, isn't the queen's$gown magnificent?
570	00:44:05,093	00:44:07,961	$The fabric, the embroidery,$the metalwork.
571	00:44:07,996	00:44:09,630	$I've never seen$anything like it.
572	00:44:09,664	00:44:11,565	$You might find a bit$of armor quite useful
573	00:44:11,599	00:44:14,201	$once you become queen.$Perhaps before.
574	00:44:14,235	00:44:18,038	$<i>Joffrey tells me you stopped$your carriage at Flea Bottom</i>
575	00:44:18,072	00:44:19,840	$on your way back from$the sept this morning.
576	00:44:19,874	00:44:24,244	$Yes. I paid a visit$to an orphanage
577	00:44:24,278	00:44:25,812	$the High Septon$told me about.
578	00:44:25,846	00:44:28,527	$Margaery does a great deal of work$with the poor back in Highgarden.
579	00:44:28,549	00:44:32,853	$The lowest among us are no different from$the highest if you give them a chance
580	00:44:32,887	00:44:35,156	$and approach them$with an open heart.
581	00:44:35,223	00:44:37,258	$<i>An open heart is what</i>$<i>you'll get in Flea Bottom</i>
582	00:44:37,292	00:44:38,859	$<i>if you're not careful,</i>$<i>my dear.</i>
583	00:44:38,893	00:44:42,729	$Not long ago, we were$attacked by a mob there.
584	00:44:42,797	00:44:45,699	$We had a full complement$of guards that didn't stop them.
585	00:44:45,733	00:44:48,702	$The king barely escaped$with his life.
586	00:44:48,736	00:44:52,206	$My mother's always had$a penchant for drama.
587	00:44:52,273	00:44:54,809	$Facts become less and less$important to her

589	00:44:56,912	00:44:59,814	$Our lives were never$truly in danger.
590	00:45:01,049	00:45:02,783	$You're right, of course.
591	00:45:02,818	00:45:06,053	$But you are$your father's son.
592	00:45:06,088	00:45:08,255	$We can't all have$a king's bravery.
593	00:45:16,432	00:45:18,633	$Hunger turns men$into beasts.
594	00:45:18,667	00:45:22,504	$I'm glad House Tyrell has been$able to help in this regard.
595	00:45:22,539	00:45:26,375	$They tell me 100 wagons arrive$daily now from the Reach.
596	00:45:26,410	00:45:29,912	$<i>Wheat, barley, apples.</i>$<i>We've had a blessed harvest.</i>
597	00:45:29,947	00:45:32,615	$And, of course, it's our$duty to assist the capital
598	00:45:32,649	00:45:34,684	$in time of need.
599	00:45:34,718	00:45:36,419	$Well, as Ser Loras said,
600	00:45:36,453	00:45:39,589	$Lady Margaery has done$this sort of...
601	00:45:39,623	00:45:41,557	$charitable work before.

603	00:45:46,096	00:45:48,131	$I'm sure she does.
604	00:46:16,561	00:46:19,363	$The Unsullied have stood here$for a day and a night
605	00:46:19,398	00:46:21,533	$with no food or water.
606	00:46:27,841	00:46:29,775	$They will stand$until they drop.
607	00:46:32,112	00:46:34,012	$Such is their$obedience.

609	00:46:38,151	00:46:40,119	$Tell me of their training.
610	00:47:00,408	00:47:02,976	$They begin their$training at five.

612	00:47:05,013	00:47:07,181	$until they have mastered$the shortsword,

614	00:47:09,651	00:47:13,254	$Only one boy in four survives$this rigorous training.
615	00:47:15,457	00:47:19,326	$<i>Their discipline</i>$<i>and loyalty are absolute.</i>
616	00:47:19,360	00:47:21,128	$<i>They fear nothing.</i>
617	00:47:21,162	00:47:24,197	$Even the bravest men$fear death.
